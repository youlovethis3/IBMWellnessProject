"What kind of over-the-counter allergy medicine helps upper puffy cheeks or ""malar mounds""?","This sounds like a very unfortunate problem, and I am sorry to hear that you have been suffering from this for so long. Given that this has been a problem over such an extended amount of time, I would say that you should probably speak to an allergist to see what can be done for you. This may include allergy testing and potentially immunotherapy (<a href=""/procedure/allergy-shots-1443"">allergy shots</a>). While these aren't for everybody, they can make a big difference for many people by altering the reactions of their immune system. Now, as for what your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> may have given you in the past, you could always speak to him or her. Otherwise, it is quite possible that what you were prescribed previously was a steroid, as these help to alleviate symptoms of allergies very quickly. Unfortunately, they have lots of other unintended side effects as well, and so are often not used for chronic problems like what you are describing. Over the counter medications are less effective, but may have some benefit. 2nd generation anti-histamines are effective for some, as are nasal decongestants. All of these should be discussed with a doctor if they are going to be used regularly. Again, please speak to your doctor. "
Irrational fear of anaphylaxis?,"So sorry that you are so worried about this problem and you should definitely discuss your concerns with your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>. The good news is that it is quite unlikely that you are prone to anaphylaxis. This condition is quite rare in the general population, and if you are old enough to write out this question on the internet and find this site then you have likely had ample opportunities to develop anaphylaxis--but haven't. You're right, the fear of the unknown can sometimes be intolerable. Perhaps it might help to think about what might happen if you DID happen to have an anaphylactic reaction. Odds are, that with appropriate and timely medical care, you would end up just fine. Medical professionals are very well trained with regards to anaphylaxis, and would know how to help you if this was needed. Again, that is very unlikely. In most instances, you would have some sort of warning before the symptoms became problematic, and that would give you the ability to react and treat any impending reaction. It is important to take medication that you have been prescribed, as the risk of not taking this could be much higher than the risk of anaphylaxis. Please speak with your doctor about your concerns. "
Am I really allergic to everything?,"Allergy testing is tricky this way, because it often gives results, such as yours, which are hard to interpret or which do not correlate well with symptoms. The best way to approach the result of allergy testing are to interpret them together with what you know practically about your symptoms. They are meant to help guide and refine treatment. 

Therefore, I would suggest that you sit down with your allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> and go through the results again in detail and explain to them your concerns and questions. In particular, make sure that they understand that you do not have any outdoor allergy symptoms, which would make the utility of treatments for those allergens seem less useful. On the other hand, if you had positive testing to indoor allergens like dust and mold, then that seems to make a fair bit more sense, as treatment for those should help improve your symptoms quite a bit. 

I'm sure that after you explain your symptoms in a bit more detail to the allergy doctor, that together you will be able to come up with a treatment plan that makes sense to both of you. Hopefully you'll be feeling a lot better very soon!"
Why do I break out into hives every two nights and need a cetrizine antihistamine tablet?,"<a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">Hives</a> (or urticaria, which is the technical medical name) are a common skin condition which occurs when certain cells in the skin release various chemicals, causing a localized red, raised, and itchy rash. For most people, hives occur for a brief episode following exposure to a substance that provokes an allergic reaction. However, for other people, hives can become a chronic problem, and it sounds like this is what is going on with you. 

I suggest that you make an appointment to see an allergy specialist. Cases of chronic hives can be difficult to manage, because it can sometimes be hard to figure out what the 'trigger' is. An allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> can perform additional testing to identify any common allergens that might be causing your flare ups. They can also consider other, non-allergy triggers of hives, which are also quite common - things like stress, heat, cold, and exercise. 

If a trigger can be identified, then avoidance will obviously be the most important component of treatment. However, the allergy doctor can also give you advice on which medications you should take to keep the hives in check. It will probably be necessary to take an anti histamine medication on a regular basis, but they can give you specific advice on dosage and frequency. Remember to book an appointment soon!"
Are these just food allergies or something else?,"It is possible that these reactions represent allergies, especially in the case of the symptoms you have when eating bananas, which do sound to me very consistent with a food allergy. 

What I would do is make an appointment with an allergy specialist to discuss this issue. They will be able to provide further advice about how to treat the symptoms.

In the meantime, I strongly suggest that you avoid all of the foods that cause these symptoms. Allergy symptoms may sometimes worsen over time with repeated exposure to the food item in question. Therefore, you should avoid continuing to expose yourself to these foods. 

Furthermore, if you experience an episode in which you develop swelling of the face or tongue, any trouble breathing, or severe <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> you should go immediately to an emergency room for evaluation, as these could be symptoms of anaphylaxis, which is a very severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction.

When you go to see the allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>, they may want to perform formal allergy testing. They will also be able to discuss medications for treating hives, and they will likely want to give you an emergency medication that you can carry with you in case of a serious reaction. Good luck, and please see a doctor soon!"
My allergy meds are not helping me. Should i consider allergy shots?,"I'm very sorry to hear that you are having such problems with your allergy and <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> symptoms! Please see a specialist to help with this problem, if you have not done so already. An allergy specialist would be a good place to start, as an allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> will be able to help you both manage your asthma symptoms and also your other non asthma allergy symptoms. Depending on how severe the sinus symptoms are, it may also be necessary to consult with an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat specialist</a>. 

The first priority will be to make sure that your asthma symptoms are under control. I say this because of all of the symptoms you have, the asthma symptoms are the ones that are most likely to be life-threatening or disabling if not properly addressed. An allergist will be able to review your prior allergy testing and symptoms and help you come up with a plan both to improve your asthma with medications and also to avoid potential allergic triggers. 

Allergy shots are a good option for people who suffer from certain classes of severe allergies, especially when they are taking optimal medications without relief. In particular, allergy shots are very useful in cases of chronic nasal allergies and sinus congestion. Your allergy doctor will be able to provide an opinion on whether it would be useful to pursue this in your case. Please be sure to discuss this with your doctor soon."
I have hives - what should I do?,"Sorry to hear that you've had such persistent trouble with <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>! Hives are a very common medical problem and, many times, they can be a chronic issue with no clear cause. 

My basic approach to hives is, first, to try to figure out whether or not there is any allergic component. You should discuss this issue with an allergy specialist, because testing for various common allergens can help to rule in or rule out potential triggers. If a trigger is identified with allergy testing, then avoiding that trigger will often clear up or at least control the hive outbreaks. 

If there is no allergic component, then it can be helpful to talk to your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> about how to look for physical or environmental triggers. Among the ""physical urticarias"" or types of hives triggered by the environment, common triggers include heat/cold, exercise, and sunlight. If you and your doctor can identify a physical trigger, then simply avoiding this trigger should do the trick. 

In terms of which anti histamines to use, individual people will react differently to different anti histamines. Therefore, the best approach is to work with your doctor to try different anti histamines until you find the one that works best for you. Looking over the list of meds you have tried, there are still quite a few different anti histamines that you haven't tried. You should, of course, do this in consultation with an allergy doctor. Good luck!"
What helps dermatographic urticaria?,"Dermatographism is a fairly common condition in which the skin is very sensitive to mechanical stimulation (like scraping or scratching over the skin). When this occurs, certain inflammatory cells under the skin surface release chemicals which cause redness and swelling that generally match the pattern of the mechanical stimulation (if you scratch in a long, straight line, you will get one long, straight hive, for example). 

Unfortunately, there is no cure for dermatographism. Treatment involves trying to limit exposure of the skin to the sorts of things that cause you to break out in <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>. This could mean, for example, that you try to refrain from scratching yourself. 

Additionally, for some people, typical anti histamine medications may be of some benefit. If taken regularly, they can help to reduce the severity of the skin reaction. 

I recommend that you talk to either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an allergy doctor. They will be able to confirm the diagnosis of dermatographism and also help determine whether there are any additional treatments that might be of benefit to you. For example, in some cases that do not respond to anti histamines, there may be a role for sun or light therapy."
What are spots that appear on hands and feet?,"Of all the symptoms you mention, the tongue swelling is most worrisome to me, because that could definitely indicate a serious allergic reaction. I would definitely suggest that you follow up with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an allergy specialist about this issue. If possible, prior to this visit, you should try to think back to see if you can remember any association between the tongue swelling episode and ingesting any particular food or any other specific  environmental exposures, as these might be clues to the potential allergy. In some cases, your doctor might recommend that additional blood or skin testing for allergies be performed to see if the offending agent can be identified. They may also recommend that you care a special emergency medication with you at all times that you can use in case of another episode of tongue swelling. 

At the same visit, your doctor can also look at the red spots on your hands or feet, which could also be consistent with an allergic exposure, although they could also be related to something else entirely. 

In the meantime, while waiting for your appointment, if you experience another episode of tongue swelling, you should go immediately to the closest emergency room for evaluation and treatment.  "
Why do I get heat rash?,"It sounds like the rash you have is probably urticaria, or <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>. This is a very common skin reaction characterized by raised, red, blotchy spots that come and go over large areas of the skin. Often, hives are quite itchy, but other times they may just be flushed and warm, as in your case. 

Many times, hives can be brought on by a specific allergic reaction, such as exposure to a specific environmental substance that your body reacts to. For example, people with certain food allergies may break out in hives when they eat those foods. 

However, it is also possible to break out in hives because of non-allergic triggers, such as stress, heat or cold, or exercise. This type of non allergic hives is called ""physical urticaria."" Generally speaking, we don't totally understand why physical urticaria occurs, but this doesn't mean that there is nothing that can be done about it! First of all, it can be helpful to identify which events or environments specifically trigger your hives and then try to avoid as many of those as possible. For example, if drinking alcohol causes you to break out, then you should avoid alcohol. Second, there are also medications that can be taken to help prevent breakouts. 

Start by seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an allergy doctor, who can give you more advice. "
Can I still have cats even though I am allergic to them?,"This depends quite a lot on what types of allergic symptoms you have and what complications they have given you. I suggest that you ask your allergist specifically what they think, as they will be the ones most able to give you a good answer, since they known your specific situation well. 

If, for example, you have <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a>, and the asthma is made worse by your allergy to cats, then this is a serious problem. Asthma flares are a leading cause of death and hospitalization, even in otherwise healthy people. For many people, getting their asthma under control requites eliminating exposures to allergens, such as <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a> dander. 

On the other hand, if you just have mild allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies), then it is unlikely that your allergy will cause significant serious problems for you. However, if you continue to be around cats, you will likely continue to suffer from the symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal congestion and itching. 

Talk to your allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> at your earliest convenience. They will help explain to you the risks and benefits of continuing to be exposed to cats, and they will be able to make a recommendation about what they think you should do for your health. "
Would a humidifier help with my stuffy nose?,"It sounds like you are probably dealing with a case of nasal allergies or sinus congestion, both of which can lead to this persistent stuffy nose. 

A humidifier can help in some cases of nasal congestion. They do this by preventing drying out of the nasal passages at night while you sleep, which can lead to a reactive 'rebound' congestion in the morning. 

However, I think you probably need to consider more definitive treatment of your nasal congestion as well. In particular, if there is a component of allergies or sinus involvement here, then you really need to target those causes if you want to see your symptoms improve. For example, both sinus and nasal allergy problems are best treated with a combination of anti histamine medications and nasal steroid sprays. These are medications that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> can prescribe for you, if they agree that this is a useful line of treatment to pursue. 

In general, I would avoid over the counter nasal decongestants, as these only work for a short period of time and, if used chronically, may actually lead to worsening of symptoms. 

I suggest that you go see your primary care doctor about this issue again for additional help along the lines I mention above. "
If you are allergic to one kind of nut does it mean that you are allergic to all of them?,"The answer to your question is that it depends. The ""tree nuts"" include nuts like almonds, walnuts, and cashews. They are distinct from peanuts, which are actually not nuts at all. However, especially in children, it is quite common to be allergic to both tree nuts and peanuts simultaneously. In adults, it is less common to be allergic to all of these nuts at the same time. 

Furthermore, within the category of 'tree nuts' there are multiple different sub classes. It is possible to be allergic to all tree nuts or only to one sub class of tree nuts. For example, almonds are totally unrelated to walnuts, so many people who are allergic to one are not allergic to another. 

The only way to know this for sure is either to experiment with different nuts, or to have formal allergy testing to figure out which nuts you might be allergic to. Before doing anything, I would discuss the issue with your allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>. If you have had a severe reaction to almonds, I definitely would not recommend challenging yourself with another type of nut unless your allergy doctor clears you to do this! Your allergy doctor can also set up the formal allergy testing. "
Can one allergy lead to another?,"It is not the case that one allergy leads to another, in the sense that one food allergy 'triggers' an allergy to another food. However, it is the case that people who are allergic to one food do tend to be allergic to other foods as well. The reason for this probably mostly has to do with the individual genetics of that person, which have predisposed them to be 'allergic' to various foods or other substances in the environment. 

If you are allergic to peanuts, or to any other food, it is important to talk with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an allergy doctor about this issue, if you have not done this already. This is because certain types of allergic reactions can be quite serious, even life threatening. For this reason, most people who have had a serious allergic reaction to a food like peanuts should carry an emergency allergy pen with them at all times in case they come into accidentally contact with a food containing the allergen. 

Your doctor will be able to assess the severity of your reaction and help determine if you need this prescription. They will also be able to give you more general advice about which foods to avoid. "
Why do my eyes water so much when I am sleeping?,"The production of tears is a medical process that is known as lacrimation. The normal function is to lubricate and wash the eyes. There are several conditions which can cause excess lacrimation and therefore cause excess tears. I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to investigate and potential treat it.

If this has only recently started, a possible cause of this is an infection. Bacterial conjuctivitis is an infection caused by a bacteria that also causes red eye, eye pain and blurred vision. This often affects only one eye. If this seems like something that is affecting you -- please see your doctor emergently. Viral conjuctivitis often affects both eyes and occurs when a virus infects the eyes. This can cause similar symptoms as bacterial conjuctivitis. Viral conjuctivitis often resolves after 1-2 weeks.

However the most common cause of excess tears is actually allergies. People often can be allergic to various substances -- often on their pillow such as dust mites or other dust particles. This reaction often causes histamine release in the body which can cause increased tears, itchy eyes and potentially nasal symptoms.

I would recommend that you see your primary care doctor to have this evaluated. This may be related to allergies. Good luck!"
What do I do now that I know I have a wheat allergy?,"There are two different types of wheat allergy. The first is detected by blood tests or skin testing by an allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> that determines that you have a sensitivity to wheat. In this type of wheat allergy, symptoms can be very variable, from acute allergic reactions, to various skin reactions like <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a> or eczema. Typically the symptoms will improve a lot if you simply cut out wheat from your diet, although one caveat is that it is typical for people with one food allergy to have another food allergy also, so you may need to engage in further dietary modifications. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your allergy doctor will be able to help guide you through this process. 

The second type of wheat 'allergy' is something called celiac disease, which is a condition in which consuming a wheat protein called gluten leads to an autoimmune reaction in the intestines. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Fortunately, with celiac disease, most symptoms are likely to resolve completely after a short while, as long as you are able to strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet. 

Both of these types of wheat sensitivity do require regular followup with your doctor, so make sure that you see your primary care doctor or your allergist soon. "
Is Bactrim supposed to cause nausea?,"Bactrim is a sulfonamide antibiotic used to treat infection. It's a relatively commonly prescribed antibiotic. Bactrim is a sulfa- medication, which means that if you have allergies to sulfa medications, then you should probably not take Bactrim. 

In regard to your question, as to whether Bactrim is SUPPOSED to cause nausea. No it is not. But antibiotics, like all other medications, can and do have side effects. It is not uncommon for patients to develop nausea, or some sort of gastrointestinal (""stomach"") irritiation. Many antibiotics can cause stomach upset. And this is a known side effect. It is impossible to predict who will have an adverse reaction to any given medication until you've tried it and have experienced it. Sometimes it helps to take these antibiotics with food, to decrease the irritation you experience and to help reduce nausea. If you are completely intolleratn of this antibiotic, you may need to call your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and get a prescription for a different medication that won't cause nausea, but that covers for your specific infection. 

I would still try to take the bactrim until you get a different antibiotic, or unless your nausea is severe. It is important to treat your infection promptly. 

Speak to your primary care doctor about getting a different antibiotic which may be better tolerated by your stomach and intestines. "
How do you get checked for food and drug allergies?,"There are a few different ways that allergy testing in performed. One way is to measure the amount of antibodies in the bloodstream against specific allergens. Another way is skin testing, which involves injecting small amounts of the allergen into the skin and looking for an allergic reaction. Both of these tests are typically performed by an allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>. 

However, it is generally a really bad idea to go looking for allergies without any specific reason. It is exceedingly unlikely that all of your 'small health problems' are related just to a simple allergy. If you have not talked with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this plan, you need to do so to get their opinion about what might be causing your multiple small health problems. 

The danger of performing allergy testing without a good reason to do so (meaning, a high suspicion that you a truly allergic to one or more specific allergens) is that the testing is likely going to turn up something that is slightly positive, as these tests are not very specific and are sometimes hard to interpret. Out of context, this positive test might not mean anything. 

Start by getting a formal evaluation for your small health problems with your primary care doctor. They will determine if allergy might be an issue and if it might need to be tested for. "
How do antihistamines help with allergies?,"An allergy is a reaction produced from a trigger (for example: pollen) that causes release of histamines by mast cells in your body. When mast cells are triggered, they release histamines (organic compound produced by your body) which bind specific histamine receptors on various tissues throughout the body, including the blood vessels. The inding of histamine to its receptor causes increased vascular permeability which allows fluids to leak through tissues more readily. This translates into allergic symptoms such as runny nose and watery eyes. Antihistamines are a class of medications that compete with histamines in your body for histamine receptor. By binding the histamine receptor, they prevent actual histamines from binding these receptors, which means the histamines can't exert their effect and cause fluid leakage. What all of this translates to, is decreased symptoms of allergies, such as runny nose, watery eyes and postnasal drip. If you have any of these symptoms, it is certainly worth trying an anti-histamine medication to try to alleviate yout symptoms. There are many common over-the-counter medications that are available at a local pharmacy -- the most common one being Diphenhydramine (Brand name: Benadryl). 

There are many other types of allergy medications if antihistamines are not helpful. Speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about all of the options for your allergies. "
Does stress cause hives?,"Hives, as you probably know, are red, raised, and itchy blotches which tend to come and go on the skin. 

Stress is a known cause of hives, although this is relatively rare, unless you have a history of getting hives from stress or <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> in the past. 

If not, then you will need to look for other potential causes. It is very common to get hives, for example, in the setting of several infections, especially common viral infections like the cold or the flu. If you have recently had an infection like this, it could explain why you are getting hives. 

Another very common reason for getting hives is because of an allergic reaction, for example to an insect bite or to something that you ate. This is a potentially more serious cause of hives, because it could be a sign of an impending serious allergic reaction. 

You should definitely get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for help figuring out what is going on. In the meantime, if you have any swelling of your face or tongue, any nausea or vomiting or <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, or any trouble breathing, these could all be signs of a very serious allergic reaction, and you would need to go to the emergency room right away. "
Did I develop an egg allergy?,"I will say that it is quite rare for someone to develop a food allergy later in life after being exposed to that food many times without a reaction.  With that said it is possible for you to develop an allergy as our immune system evolves over time.  It just isn't that common.  There are two reasons why you should get this checked out.  First, egg allergies are common and have implications for getting shots every year such as the <a href=""/procedure/flu-shot-134"">flu shot</a> (which contains egg products).  The second reason that you should get this checked out is that your apparent reaction sounds severe.  You never want to ignore a reaction that could close your airway and prevent you from being able to breath.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergist.  The reason I want you to see a specialist is that you need allergy testing.  This is where the <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> will challenge you with a sample of the allergen (usually with a small injection under the skin) and see if you react to it.  If you do, then you will know that you are allergic to eggs.  If you don't react to it, then you know that the feeling of your throat closing was caused by something else.  "
Why are my allergies so bad?,"There are a couple different reasons why your allergies may be acting up.  First, it is possible that you have developed an allergy to a new substance that your aren't aware of.  This is probably the least likely possibility.  The second possibility is that your reaction to an allergen that you have always been allergic to is now more severe.  Our immune systems do evolve over time which could explain this.  The most likely possibility is that you are now being exposed to an allergen that you weren't previously.  If you recently moved to a new location or if you recently got a new <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a>, these are the most likely culprits.  New plants are also possibility.  If you recently starting dating a new person, then a different laundry detergent could be the cause.  

What you need is allergy testing.  This is where an allergist tests you for a reaction to many different types of allergens.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergist today.  He or she will take a thorough history and begin treatment with anti-allergen medications (such as anti-histamines medications).  You can also schedule allergy testing so you can figure out what you are allergic to and try to limit your exposure.  "
Can hives be an allergic reaction to something I ate?,"<a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">Hives</a> are red, itching blotches that appear on the skin, usually as you suspect in response to an allergic or other sensitizing trigger. For example, although hives are very common with food allergies, as you mention, they can also be caused by other triggers, such as a recent viral infection. Also, a number of medication sensitivities or allergies can cause hives. 

I suggest that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. They will be able to help you review any potential recent exposures (such as a virus, medication, new laundry detergent, etc) to see if an offending agent can be identified. They can also give you suggestions about what medications you can take to relieve the itching if the hives recur. 

Occasionally, hives can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction that requires emergency medical attention. In particular, if you notice any swelling of the face, lips or tongue, or if you have any trouble swallowing or breathing, you need to seek immediate medical help in an emergency room, as these, together with the hives, may be signs of a life threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. 

Assuming you do not have any of these serious symptoms, you can just make the appointment with your primary care doctor at your earliest convenience. "
Can someone be allergic to fruit?,"While an allergy to a fruit is a bit less common than other types of foods such as peanuts and fish, it certainly is possible.  Anytime you develop a bad reaction to eating a food, you should make note of what you ate in the meal to see what it could be.  In this case, I think it is unlikely that you are allergic to apricots.  This is because <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a> is usually not the only symptom one gets from eating a food.  While diarrhea can occur, reactions that are typical of food allergies are <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>, flushing, and sometimes difficulty breathing.  Diarrhea can occur because of a food, but that has more to do with your digestive system than an allergy.

If you have a similar reaction again to another food, or if you develop one of the above mentioned symptoms of diarrhea, then you should get tested for that allergy.  To do this, you will need to schedule an appointment with an allergist.  An allergist is a specialist who can perform allergy testing which can help get to the bottom of what you may be allergic to.  This way, you will know what types of foods you need to avoid, and which ones are not that worrisome."
Why do people get hives?,"The medical term for ""<a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>"" is urticaria, which refers to the pale/red raised itchy rash that occurs, often associated with an allergic response. There are actually different general categories of urticaria; acute and chronic. Acute urticaria is almost always due to an allergic response. Chronic urticaria (usually lasting more than 6 weeks) on the other hand is rarely due to an allergic source. Judging by the information that you have provided, it doesn't sound like you have a case of chronic urticaria. However, without being able to examine you, or take a thorough history, I won't be able to give you an exact answer about what may have caused your urticaria in the first place. The swelling and itchy rash that occurs is secondary to histamine release from mast cells (regardless of the initial causative insult). This response can be modulated by both over the counter and prescription medications called anti-histamines. However the best way to avoid developing hives again is by identifying what actually caused the response in the first place, and avoiding it in the future. I would recommend making an appointment with an allergist to have them evaluate you and take a thorough history. They may even do some allergy testing at that visit. I hope this was helpful, and I wish you all the best. "
How long does an allergic reaction usually last?,"The length of time that your allergic response lasts depends on a few factors.  The first (and most important factor) is whether or not the reaction you experienced was a classic immune system allergic response.  Other reactions to medications can occur that are not technically allergies.  The second factor that is important is how long the medication you took stays in your system.  Some medications leave your system after a few hours and other stick around for a while.  For most allergic reactions, the initial symptoms begin to go away a few hours after the allergen is removed and should be nearly completely gone after 1-2 days.  If the itchy rash that you have on your arms and hands is <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a> (which would indicate a classic allergic reaction), you should see these go away fairly soon.

It would be nice to know if your reaction was an allergic reaction, and if you are allergic to any other medications.  For this reason, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist.  This is the type of <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> who can test you for an allergy to this medication and other medications.  In addition, he or she can provide treatment, should you experience this rash again.  Good luck.  "
What are the chances of anaphylactic shock if I get allergy shots?,"<a href=""/procedure/allergy-shots-1443"">Allergy shots</a> are indeed useful for certain types of allergies, especially nasal allergies and sinus symptoms like the kinds you are experiencing. The principle is that gradual exposure to the allergen that causes the allergic reaction can actually help dampen down the body's reaction. 

Most of the time, allergy shots are really well tolerated, although they can sometimes cause symptoms. In particular, there is a low chance of having a serious anaphylactic reaction to the shots. This usually occurs in the first 30 minutes after getting the shot. For this reason, your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> will keep you in the office under observation for about 30 or 60 minutes after you get the shot to make sure this is not happening to you. 

If you do not have any symptoms in this first period of time after shot administration, then it is unlikely that you will have any. Occasionally, however, there can be a delayed allergy reaction hours afterwards. This is not usually as severe as anaphylaxis, but many <a href=""/allergists"">doctors</a> still give those injectable Epi Pens out as a safety precaution. 

Please talk to your allergy doctor for more specific information about your course of allergy shots and any side effects you might experience. "
Can allergy shots cure a food allergy?,"<a href=""/procedure/allergy-shots-1443"">Allergy shots</a> are a form of desensitization therapy used to help people whose allergies have not been responsive to the usual treatment.  The idea is that if you expose someone to the allergen over and over again, you can cause their body to get used to it and no longer respond with an allergic reaction.  This type of therapy works particularly well for seasonal and environmental allergies.  Unfortunately, there is no role for allergy shots when it comes to treating food allergies.  This is because they don't tend to work very well and would not reduce symptoms to the point where you could begin enjoying strawberries.  For now, your best bet is to avoid them so that you can avoid the reaction.

Since you have a food allergy, it would be best for you to schedule an appointment with an allergist.  The allergy specialist will be able to discuss with you the best treatment options you have for this allergy besides just complete abstinence.  There are other therapies such as biologic agents that may play a role in reducing your symptoms, especially if they are mild to begin with.  In addition, any other allergy that you have can get looked into and treated appropriately.  "
Could a vitamin E deficiency be causing my allergies?,"There is no definitive evidence that vitamin E is related to allergies. I do not believe that there is any reason to suspect that you have a vitamin E deficiency (unless you have specific medical problems), and even if you did, there is no reason to suspect that vitamin E pills would help. There are also side effects of taking excess vitamin E. I would not recommend taking these pills. I would however recommend discussing this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she could better evaluate your condition, and potentially provide you with more established treatments for seasonal allergies.

Vitamin E is a fat soluble vitamin that naturally occurs in most diets. Unless you have specifically unusual diet or have problems with absorbing fatty foods -- you should not be deficient in this. Rarely, people with severe pancreatic problems cannot absorb fat well enough -- therefore become deficient in vitamin E. However, if you are not have a history of these condition -- it would be highly unlikely you are deficient in it.

There is no data that vitamin E help with allergies. Allergies occur when the immune system recognizes a substance as foreign and release histamine through a specific pathway. Vitamin E deficiency causes muscle problems, nerve problems and occasional a weakened immune system.

Talk to your doctor. There are good treatments for allergies, but vitamin E is not a known one."
Can you get a blood test to determine if you have a food allergy?,"Food allergies are common.  They are also commonly misunderstood by <a href=""/allergists"">doctors</a> as well as patients.  The diagnosis of food allergy begins with a detailed medical history and physical examination.  While a skin prick test is preferable, a blood test can be used to confirm if you have a food allergy by looking for antibodies.  The most common type of blood test used is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA or EIA).  It  measures the amount of immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies that your body may make in response to a specific allergen.  Obviously, you can just avoid an allergic reaction by staying away from foods that cause signs and symptoms.  However, despite your best efforts, you may accidentally come into contact with a food that triggers the reaction.  Seeking treatment for allergy is important.  You didn't state how severe you are allergic to peanuts.   For a minor allergic reaction, over-the-counter or prescribed antihistamines may help reduce symptoms.  However, antihistamines can't treat a severe allergic reaction.    For a severe allergic reaction, you may need an injection of epinephrine.  Many people carry with them at all times an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, EpiPen Jr.,  Twinject) for an emergency situation.  Peanut allergy is not to be taken lightly.  In bad cases, peanut allergies can trigger a condition called anaphylaxis, which is a sudden, potential life-threatening reaction.  I would recommend a consultation with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or an allergist.  "
What should I do if I'm taking allergy medication but it isn't working?,"The answer to your question depends somewhat on what is causing your allergies.  If your allergies are caused by an environmental factor such as pollen, there are many more options you have to help your symptoms.  The best thing you can do is determine what your allergy is and avoid it if possible.  If this isn't possible, then you can begin looking at other treatments.  If your nose is one of your problems, then you may benefit from a steroid nasal spray that you take daily.  These nasal sprays act to calm down the inflammation in your nose and prevent the symptoms from occurring when you're exposed to the allergen.  It is also possible that you will respond to a different antihistamine.  Perhaps your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> can examine which one you used and prescribe a different one.  If neither of these two options work, then you can look into other possible treatments.

Since you have failed first line treatment for an allergy, you should probably be seen by a specialist.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergist.  The allergist will be able to perform a more detailed analysis of your allergies and tailor the treatment to your specific situation.  Good luck. "
Could my medication be causing the metallic taste in my mouth?,"There are many things that can cause funny tastes in the mouth, and one of those is definitely starting a new medication. Angiotensing Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (aka, ACE inhibitors or ACE-I) are known for causing this complication. It is thought that they do this by decreasing the amount of zinc available for your taste buds to use. As your taste buds are dependent on zinc, the end result is a sweet, salty, or metallic taste. Unfortunately, there are many other things that can cause changes in taste, and so you will still need to speak with your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>, as some of these could be signs of something serious. Definitely, the chronology of your symptoms and the new medication do make sense, however. The same doctor who prescribed the ACE inhibitor would be a great place to start with this question, as you should never discontinue a medication without consulting your doctor. While there are many options for blood pressure medications, ACE inhibitors have been found to be very effective at decreasing the complications of some disease states, in addition to working well at controlling blood pressure with minimal side effects in many people. Please speak to your doctor. "
Do allergy shots really cure allergies?,"<a href=""/procedure/allergy-shots-1443"">Allergy shots</a> work on the principle that exposing a person with allergies to initially small and then higher doses of the substance the are allergic to will make the body gradually tolerant to the allergen and will reduce the symptoms of allergy on subsequent exposures. Allergy shots don't work for all types of allergies; they are better for environmental allergies like mold and mites and don't work very well for food allergies. 

I think of allergy shots as the last step in the treatment of bad allergies. They are quite expensive and they do require a long time commitment, as you need to make multiple visits to your allergy <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> for shots over weeks to months. Therefore, I don't think of allergy shots as a first-line treatment. 

In particular, if you haven't maximized your treatment of your allergy symptoms with medications, I would recommend this first. There are multiple medications that are used to treat allergy symptoms, including steroid sprays and anti histamines. If, on the other hand, you are using all of these medications and still not having good symptom relief, than allergy shots may be the way to go. 

Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your allergy doctor will be able to provide additional insight. "
Can you suddenly develop an allergy to cats?,"An allergic reaction occurs when your immune system mistakenly believes substances that are harmless to most people to be harmful to your body and responds by producing immunoglobin E (IgE) antibodies to destroy what your body has perceived as foreign invaders (allergens).  These IgE antibodies trigger the release of histamines, leukotrienes, and other chemicals to cause allergy symptoms.  You do develop allergies from repeated exposure to the allergen.  Therefore, anyone can develop or grow out of allergy symptoms at any time.  Your age also has something to do with developing allergies.  Since repeated exposure to certain allergens can trigger an allergic reaction, it is possible to develop allergies when you're older, as you've had more time to be in contact with the allergens.  It is possible that you suddenly develop an allergy to cats.  You may be allergic to certain chemicals in <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a> dander to trigger histamines in your bodies.  That said, you should take notice if you are allergic to other cats as well.  If you notice that only your roommate's cat gives you the allergic symptoms, perhaps you are allergic to something else.  Perhaps you are allergic to the ragweed that is bloomed in the area and the cat is carrying the spores from that ragweed into the house on its fur.   The best way to truly know is to see an allergy specialist or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to have it checked out so you can be treated accordingly."
What causes extremely sensitive skin?,"This sounds like you may have developed a physical urticaria. This is a condition in which <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a> form on the skin in response to physical stimuli, in your case things like scratching the skin or applying pressure. In fact the type of physical urticaria where the red marks mostly form only when the skin is pressured or scratched is called dermatographism, which is the most common form of physical urticaria. This is likely what you have. 

Most of the time, physical urticarias happen for unknown reasons. The encouraging flip side of this is that they are rarely associated with serious underlying <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> like cancer or celiac, although it is always important to have a thorough examination and checkup by your regular <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>. 

Most physical urticarias can be managed with taking daily anti histamine medications, usually at a higher dose than would normally be used for typical allergy symptoms. You should talk to your doctor about this first; if a trial of anti histamines doesn't work for you, then that would be the appropriate time to seek a referral to an allergy specialist. An allergy specialist can perform additional testing to confirm the diagnosis and is also more skilled in dealing with the more difficult to treat cases of this condition. "
Can you develop food allergies later in life?,"It is possible, though much less common, to develop a food allergy later in life.  Though your reaction does not seem at first to be an allergic reaction, the fact that it is occurring when you eat peanuts (a very common food that people are allergic to), your doctor(s) should take this reaction seriously.

Most of the time when people develop a food allergy, they get certain characteristic symptoms.  For example a mild allergic reaction would be the development of <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>, itchiness, severe <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> or nausea all shortly after the ingestion of the food.  In severe cases, the culprit food will cause swelling in the airways making it more difficult to breath and even sometimes a low blood pressure.  In these cases, the food must be avoided at all costs and the effected person carry a rescue epinephrine syringe to inject themselves if need be.  

The only way to find out if this is an allergy is for you to be tested.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist.  An allergist has the resources to perform a special type of allergy testing to see if your immune system reacts to peanuts.  If it does, then your symptoms may be due to an allergy.  "
Why are my eyes watery all the time?,"The most likely thing still is that this is a subtle manifestation of eye allergies, also known as allergic conjunctivitis. As you know of course, most commonly allergic conjunctivitis will have symptoms like a sensation of dryness, as well as redness and itching. Sometimes, however, the only symptoms may be excessive tearing. This is especially true if you already have a history of seasonal or environmental allergies. If so, I would suggest treating this as you normally would (avoiding dust, smoke, and potential allergens; taking an antihistamine medication like Zyrtec (cetirizine) or Claritin (loratidine)) and seeing what happens. If things do not clear up then you might want to go see your <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a>. 

Other potential causes of eye tearing would include an infection with a virus or bacteria (unlikely without more severe symptoms), trouble with dirty <a href=""/procedure/contact-lenses-99"">contact lenses</a> (if you wear contacts), a small scrape or scratch on the eye (more likely if the tearing is more in one eye than in the other). 

Please discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to make an assessment and determine whether any specific treatment is needed. "
What kinds of health problems can mold cause?,"Molds in essence are fungi. Molds are often found in places with poor ventilation, dark, dampy environments such as basements, bathrooms, kitchens, cellars and places with poor cleaning. Mold is common and is found in nature, is a normal component of dirt and dust. It is found in several forms and some mold is used in cooking (flour yeast) and in making antibiotics.

Generally, people exposed to mold for short amounts of time and limited number of times tend to be alright. People who are immuno-compromised may have unfavorable reactions to mold.  If you are commonly exposed to mold you may have allergic type symptoms such as wheezing, runny eyes, dry cough, scratchy throat. You may also have increased tiredness, fatigue and other non descriptive symptoms. Generally after exposure to mold you should contact your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, especially if you have the above symptoms. Your primary care provider may in turn refer you to an allergist or infectious disease <a href=""/allergists"">doctor</a> who may have additional strategies. 

It is important to realize that exposure to mold is extremely common.  It is also important to realize that it may be harmful. Please see your physician for more specific information about how it could affect you."
Can allergies cause nasal bleeding?,"Hi, there.  Allergies can indeed cause nasal <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>, though usually it is not profuse and will stop easily, as yours does.  When the body develops an allergy a common symptoms is rhinorrhea (runny nose).  Because the fluid flowing past the lining of your nose is very watery, is basically leeches fluid out of the cells in this mucosal lining (a process called osmosis).  Constant irritation from rhinorrhea, blowing your nose, rubbing it, etc. all cause this already dried out tissue to break and tear easily.  Over a certain period of time this can lead to bleeding, since the blood vessels in the lining of your nose are very superficial and close to the skin.  In fact, over long periods of time your body can even begin to develop thickening of the lining which can lead to polyps.  

The bottom line is that in just the same way you may need to put lotion on your skin when you live in a poor climate, you need good mucosal care too when it is in the hostile environment of allergies.  The first thing I would suggest is saline sprays.  This helps to even out the osmolarity of the fluids so that the fluid in your cells does not get sucked out and dry out the tissue.  In addition, make sure the humidity in your house is sufficient.  You may want to buy a humidifier if you don't have one built in.  And lastly, get your allergies under control! If you have not already, you should see an allergy specialist.  There are a number of treatments available and you get help finding the one that works for you.  "
Will allergy shots prevent an allergic reaction completely?,"<a href=""/procedure/allergy-shots-1443"">Allergy shots</a> are a type of immunotherapy that is designed to trick your immune system into not reacting to an allergen anymore.  In some people allergy shots can be very effective.  They are not a miracle cure, but they can sometimes result in a great reduction in symptoms.  

Allergy shots are actually shots that have very low amounts of the allergen itself.  Each shot has a slightly higher concentration of the allergen allowing the body to get used to it little by little.  The shots require you to go back to the <a href=""/allergists"">doctors</a> office many times and can be a burden on your schedule.  Since the shots are designed to desensitize people to one allergen, they only work for one allergy and won't conquer all of your allergies.  In addition they can be expensive.  Thus, they are usually reserved for people that have tried other forms of allergy therapy including medications and have not gotten relief.  Also, people that have severe life threatening allergies can sometimes benefit from shots.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an allergy specialist (also known as an allergist).  He or she will look at your allergy record and determine what you are allergic and if you warrant a trial for allergy shots.  Good luck.  "
what kind of doctor should i see if i have excessive underarm sweating?,"Hyperhidrosis, as excessive sweating is known in medical circles, is a common and unfortunate condition that can be disabling to the people who suffer from it. Most commonly, the hands, feet and axilla are affected, although other parts of the body may also be involved. In general there is a stepwise approach to treating the condition, beginning with more conservative methods, such as topical treatments including Drysol that may be applied regularly under the arms. If that fails, more invasive measures include medications with differing side effects, all of which are aimed at decreasing sweat production. Some common side effects to some commonly used medications include dry mouth, constipation, and impotence. Up to this point, a family practice <a href=""/surgeons"">doctor</a> would be a good place to start, with the possibility of being referred to a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> if the first few therapies are unsuccessful.
Ultimately, however, injections and ultimately surgery are the final therapies that remain for many individuals. Botox injections in under the arms can be highly effective at decreasing sweat in that region, although they do need to be repeated every 3-12 months. Surgery generally involves some sort of procedure to severe the nerve that supplies the sweat glands of the involved area (this is commonly done through a small incision in the chest wall, after which a camera is used to guide the remainder of the surgery). All surgery does carry some risk, however, and you should make sure that this is right for you before proceeding. 
In short, start with your family practice doctor or a neurologist, and hope for the best. Ultimately, a thoracic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> will be your last good option for therapy."
Should my lipoma be removed?,"Lipomas are benign growths of fatty tissue that develop under the skin. Sometimes there is a genetic disposition to them, and often people who have one lipoma will develop others as well. Fortunately, there is virtually no danger of a lipoma turning into cancer, so often they can be left alone, as your previous <a href=""/surgeons"">doctors</a> have suggested. 

The main reasons for removing a lipoma is for cosmetic reasons, for example if the appearance of it bothers you. Also, sometimes lipomas continue to grow and can become uncomfortable because they brush against clothing or are easily knocked on furniture and other objects; this would be another reason to consider removal. 

Generally, removal of the lipoma is quite straightforward. Usually, it can be done in the doctor's office with just some local numbing medication injected into the skin at the site. Many doctors are capable of taking off lipomas, however if the lipoma is located in a sensitive area, such as close to blood vessels or delicate structures (as you were told by your doctor), then removal may require referral to a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. 

If you have decided that removal is the right option for you, then you should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who may perform the removal themselves or may make a referral for you. "
Nipple turning in after breast reduction?,"Breast reduction <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> can have a few complications. Nipple inversion, also known as invaginated nipple, is a common condition for many conditions. Regardless, I would recommend following up with your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> in order to further evaluate this. 

There are a few causes of inverted nipple. After surgery this can occur due to natural restructuring of the breast tissue. Generally speaking, there are many small ligaments in the breast that attach to the nipple and areola. If tension is put on these ligaments in a new pattern, the nipple can be pulled in and therefore cause and inverted nipple. Surgeons work to ensure this does not occur. However, it is possible that it has occurred. One complication that might have caused this is hardening of some part of the breast tissue which changed the structure of the ligaments. Fat necrosis can cause this -- which is hardening of a part of the breast tissue. Other breast masses could cause this. 

Other causes of inverted nipple should be considered. A common one is actually pregnancy. You should ensure that you are not at risk for this. Other causes like hormonal problems or infection could also be causing this.

Talk to your surgeon. This should be evaluated. Good luck!"
Is it better to have open or closed biopsy?,"There are many differences between the two types of <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> methods. In terms of their ability to obtain the appropriate tissue to obtain a diagnosis, this is a discussion that is best had with your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. In terms of the general differences between the two procedures, a closed biopsy is done with a needle that is passed into the breast tissue using a variety of techniques, including stereotactic guidance, CT guidance, and <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> guidance. Regardless of the modality used to guide the needle, the main benefits of this procedure are that they can be done with local anesthetic (you do not need to go under general anesthesia), a very small amount of tissue is removed, and there is generally no residual scarring along the breast. In terms of an open biopsy, this is usually done under general anesthesia, a small incision is made and the breast tissue is visualized and removed using a variety of techniques. The main benefits of this procedure are that with more tissue removed, the ability to make a diagnosis is improved. The drawbacks of this include the postoperative pain, and scarring as well as the post anesthesia effects you may experience. Of course, this discussion is best to be had with your breast surgeon because they will be able to assess your medical history and discuss your specific concerns."
Do you have to stop Antabuse before surgery?,"It is important that the physician that will be performing your <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> know all the medications that you are taking so that he or she can determine what is safe to continue, and what must be stopped.  The answer to your question depends on the type of surgery you are having, the length of recovery, and most importantly, your surgeon's preference.  Therefore, I cannot give you the exact answer to this question, but I can take a good guess.  

As you may know, Antabuse (also known as Disulfiram) is a drug that inhibits one of the steps in the metabolism of alcohol.  It does have some side effects and the potential to interact with other drugs.  However, if your surgery is minor, and no major medications that interact with Antabuse will be given, then likely you will be able to continue it before and after the surgery.  However, if you will receive a drug during the surgery that interacts with Antabuse, you will have to discontinue it prior to the operation.  

I suggest that you contact the surgeon that will be performing your procedure.  He or she will be able to give you explicit pre-operative instructions and explain what you should and should not take prior to the operation.  Hopefully, taking your Antabuse will not be a problem and you won't be at risk for relapse.  I hope it all goes well.  "
What is gastric bypass surgery?,"Congratulations on your attempt to get your weight under control. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the best things you can do for your health. I would encourage you to talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to further assess your need and eligibility

Gastric bypass surgery is a general term for a collection of surgeries that are aimed at weight reduction. The procedure is done by a bariatric <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who your primary <a href=""/surgeons"">doctor</a> can refer you to. In general, the procedures work to decrease the size of the stomach. The smaller stomach results in people being  able to eat less and subsequently losing weight. The bypass refers to the original procedure where the small intestine was used as a substitute pouch to ""bypass"" the stomach. Other procedures now simply put an inflatable band around the stomach. 

The major indication for gastric bypass is based on Body Mass Index or BMI. This is your weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Generally speaking, BMI &gt;40 is an indication or BMI &gt; 35 with associated weight related co-morbidity. 

There are always risks associated with surgery and this one is no exception. Infections, bowel leakage and bleeding can occur. The rate of complications vary with surgeon but may be ~10%.

Gastric bypass surgery is a good option for people who meet the above indications. There are some contraindications that one must consider and an overall risk / benefit analysis is needed. Discuss this with your doctor who may refer you to a bariatric surgeon."
Can diverticulitis require intestine removal?,"To answer this question, I think I will start by explaining what <a href=""/procedure/diverticulitis-diverticulosis-1070"">diverticulitis</a> is.  Diverticulitis is an infection of a diverticulum.  A diverticulum is an out-pouching of the intestinal wall.  Having many diverticuli is called having diverticulosis.  Sometimes, pieces of stool and other material get stuck inside a diverticulum resulting in a small abscess.  When a patient presents with the classic diverticulitis (abdominal pain, <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, plus evidence on a CT scan), the usual care is to treat the patient with fluids, possibly antibiotics, and monitor them.  If this is your first episode of diverticulitis, then you generally won't need immediate surgery.  If you have had more than one episode, then you will likely benefit from having a portion of your large intestine removed.  This surgery will not likely cause any long term complications and will prevent diverticulitis from returning.  

The best type of physician for you to see about this is a general surgeon.  Surgeon's have a set criteria for who needs to have part of their large intestine removed.  If you do not qualify yet (only had one episode of diverticulitis), then you can try to prevent it from happening again by avoiding foods with seeds.  If you do qualify for the surgery, it will prevent those diveritculi from causing you a problem again.  "
"I have erythema nodosum and positive ANA (speckled &gt;=1:1000), any idea what's causing the EN?","I am sorry to hear that you have are suffering from this condition, and am pleased that you have already spoken to a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>. These conditions are somewhat different from many other medical issues, such as infections, because they are often more difficult to appropriately diagnose and treat. Furthermore, it is often the case that an exact cause is not known, and we are left treating the symptoms. Fortunately, the treatments for many of these diseases has improved greatly over the years. Most people with EN will never find an exact answer as to why they came down with the condition. Others will find that it was a reaction to something else that they had, such as a strep throat infection. The key is to manage your symptoms appropriately so that you can continue to lead a high quality of life without interrupting your daily routine. The blood tests you mention demonstrate that there is a higher than normal level of inflammation in your body currently, but do not completely clarify a cause. The steroid you have been prescribed will help to improve your symptoms. Please continue to work with your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> closely during your treatment, and please speak with him or her about your questions. "
What is seronegative polyarthritis and how can it be treated?,"Seronegative means that there are no antibodies detectable in your blood stream that react in the standard ways that <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologists</a> use to classify the different types of <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> syndromes. Polyarthritis means that you have multiple joints that are inflamed or involved. 

I would recommend discussing this issue with your rheumatologist. Although I don't know all of the information about your case, I therefore gather that you have a fairly significant degree of joint stiffness and pain that affects multiple joints. This probably has the features of a typical autoimmune joint condition, but your blood tests have come back negative. It turns out that a good proportion of autoimmune joint conditions fall into this category. 

They can be a bit more difficult to treat, because the lack of antibody reactions in the bloodstream according to a standard pattern makes it harder to know which medications are likely to be effective. This often means more visits to see your rheumatologist while different medications are trialed to see which is most effective. 

I would start by setting up a follow-up visit with your rheumatologist to discuss the issue. They should be able to tell you what they are thinking in terms or your available treatment options and plans for follow up."
What is gout?,"I recommend your aunt discuss this issue with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> right away.

As you may have heard from your aunt, patients with <a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">gout</a> typically experience severe, acute pain in a joint or joints, characteristically the big toe.  The pain from this condition can be excruciating, to the point that even the weight of a sheet in bed overnight is too painful to tolerate.  The condition itself is caused by a buildup of uric acid crystals in the joint space which subsequently causes inflammation and pain. Treatment for gout focuses on decreasing inflammation, often using steroids either taken orally or injected into the joint space. This can be very effective for treating an initial gout outbreak, but then one must consider why a patient developed gout in the first place. It may be that the kidneys are not very efficient at excreting uric acid, thus allowing it to build up in the blood and potentially crystallize in a joint space.  Other people may over-produce uric acid via subtle differences in metabolism, while others may eat a diet high in uric acid containing foods.  In general, patients with obvious risk factors (including obesity or poor kidney function) or with multiple attacks of gout in a short period of time will often prescribed medications to help the body eliminate uric acid to prevent further attacks.

Overall, questions about diagnosing and treating gout can be addressed by a primary care physician or by a rheumatology specialist in severe cases. Your aunt should make an appointment right away."
"Aching joints, swelling, fatigue and always ill?","It is not normal to have this level of pain in your joints at your age. Therefore, you definitely must see your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> if you have not done so already. You could start with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or you could, alternatively, set up a visit with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>. 

Given the constellation of symptoms you mention, especially the presence of pain in multiple joints together with fatigue, I would be most concerned to rule out a rheumatological disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis. Make sure, when you go to see your doctor, that you mention any other associated symptoms, such as swelling or redness in the joints, skin rashes, or fevers. This information will help your doctor narrow down the list of potential causes. 

In addition to a complete physical examination, your doctor will most likely want to get some basic blood tests looking at inflammatory markers in the bloodstream because, if these are positive, it is highly suggestive of a rheumatologic condition. In addition, they may obtain x-rays of one or more of the affected joints. Based on what they find with these tests, they will be able to help you decide what the next steps are."
My big toe is in pain and swollen. What could this be?,"Gout is definitely a possibility. This is a condition in which uric acid crystals build up in the joint space and lead to periodic flare ups, which are characterized by redness, warmth, and pain in the joint. Gout is often diagnosed clinically by doctors (meaning that they just examine the joint and diagnose it as gout based on the pattern of inflammation). However, in cases where there is some doubt, it is necessary usually to withdraw some liquid from the affected joint to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Some <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctors</a> perform this procedure, as do most rheumatologists. 

It is also important to rule out an infection in the joint, especially if the symptoms are not getting better, or if there is fever or other serious symptoms. Once again, aspirating some liquid from the joint space is the procedure usually used here. 

Finally, this could be a ""stubbed toe"" if you can recall a recent injury to the toe. If there is a history of trauma then it may be necessary to perform x-rays to rule out a fracture. 

Start by seeing your primary care <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> or a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> again as soon as possible. They will be able to help you decide what to do next. "
"Is my joint and muscle pain normal, or should I see a doctor?","The fact that you have such diffuse musculoskeletal pain, that is persistent and unrelenting, does signal to me that you need to see your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a>. Especially given the fact that you've tried various lifestyle changes without much improvement or progress. 

I suggest starting by seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. The first thing they will want to do is examine your joints and muscles to see if there is any overt evidence of inflammation or swelling. They will probably couple this to some basic blood work, looking for evidence of inflammation there as well. If these tests are positive, they could indicate some systemic rheumatologic or inflammatory/connective tissue problem, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. 

Even if these tests are negative, there are still other conditions to consider. For example, fibromyalgia is another common disorder in people your age, and it can present with this type of chronic, diffuse musculoskeletal pain. 

Based on what your tests and exam show, your doctor will help you decide what to do. If there is evidence of a rheumatologic condition, they will want to refer you to see a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>. If there is evidence of fibromyalgia, that is a condition that they will probably feel comfortable treating themselves. "
Why would someone have constant pain in their limbs?,"I am very sorry to hear about these symptoms, which sound terrible! You definitely need to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> right away, if you have not done so already, for help figuring out what is going on. 

Right off the bat, I would say that your symptoms seem most consistent with an <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, which is an inflammation in the joints of the body. Symptoms that would go along with arthritis in addition to pain and discomfort would include swelling or redness or warmth over the affected joints. 

In someone your age and gender, there are few different causes of arthritis that would need to be ruled out. One of these is reactive arthritis, which tends to develop after a viral infection, often something as simple as a cold or flu. Another would be rheumatoid arthritis, which is a very serious form of arthritis which often can affect young women. 

Your doctor will first examine you to look for any objective evidence of joint swelling or inflammation. Based on what they find, they will probably want to do some basic blood work looking for markers of specific types of arthritis as well as to get a general sense of how much inflammation you have going on. Please see your doctor soon!"
Is my neck pain due to not using a pillow?,"Neck pain is a relatively common condition. There are many causes of this pain - some of which are minor and some of which are significant. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Hopefully, he or she should be able to diagnose the cause of your pain and (just as importantly) help you treat it.

To answer your question, yes - it is possible that not using a pillow is causing this neck pain. In general there are a few possible causes of neck pain. Primary among them is muscle spasm or inflammation. This can happen when muscles are overused, stretched or otherwise injured. It is possible that the new sleeping position for your neck is causing strain on the neck muscles and thereby causing your pain. Trying a comfortable position or different pillow may help relieve this pain.

There are other causes of neck pain to consider. Often the bone itself is the cause of symptoms. The neck bones, like any other joint, can develop <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> (formally osteoarthritis) which can cause these symptoms. Often the nerves are also effected which can cause this pain. Other cause of neck pain are more rare - but include problems in the larynx, esophagus and even heart/lungs.

Please discuss with your doctor, who can examine you and give you more information. Good luck!"
What would cause pain in pinkie finger base joint?,"I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. There are many possibilities of what could be causing your symptoms, some of which are minor and will heal on their own. Unfortunately, there are also some major causes which could be a sign of more significant issues. If necessary, your primary care doctor may refer you to a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> (a joint specialist) or an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> (a bone/ tendon/ ligament surgeon).

As for what could be causing your pain, the first thing to rule out is trauma. Have you hurt your finger? This -- even if minor -- can lead to bone, ligament or muscle injury. Another form of trauma that is less commonly recognized is a repetitive stress injury. This (tennis elbow is in the same family) occurs when repeated use (like from typing) causes inflammation in the tendon (known as tendonitis). Another consideration would be if the joint at the base of the pinkie finger (known as the 5th MCP joint) is inflamed. This can happen because of an infection, a crystal depositing (like gout), or because of the body attacking the joint (known as an autoimmune disease which includes rheumatoid arthritis or lupus). 

Talk to your doctor. While hopefully minor, this could be a reflection of a more serious disease. Good luck!"
Why am I having so much joint pain at such a young age?,"You need to see a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> about this issue if you have not done so already. It is not normal for a 20 year old person to have significant joint pain, and the issue needs to be investigated immediately to help determine whether or not you have a serious medical problem that needs treatment. 

Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be a good place to start. They will be able to examine your feet, ankles, and knees looking for any overt evidence of joint swelling or inflammation. They can also examine your feet to see what the anatomy of your arches is like. Make sure to tell your doctor what makes the pain worse (such as exercise), whether the pain moves around, or whether you have seen any swollen joints at any point. 

Your doctor will consider several possible cause of your pain. These include foot problems like plantar fasciitis and flat arches. They will also consider different types of <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, especially rheumatoid arthritis which is the main serious type of arthritis which can occur in young people. If there is any evidence of joint swelling, they will probably want to get some basic blood tests to investigate this further. 

Good luck!"
Is there a cure for gout?,"Unfortunately, <a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">gout</a> is a disease that once diagnosed is typically treated rather than cured.  It sounds like you may be on a maintenance medication to control a gout flare.  This is often how gout is managed.  Hopefully you will never have another flare like the one that caused you to be diagnosed with gout.  As you know, gout flares can be extremely painful and typically involve joints like the big toe or even knee.  Depending upon how much inflammation is involved, it can take several days for the flare to calm down.  Gout is caused by precipitation of uric acid crystals in a joint space, so the goal of maintenance gout medications is to help your body excrete enough uric acid so that you don't develop crystal build-up.  Eating certain kinds of foods--including caviar--have been associated with bringing on gout flares and we also know that some people naturally excrete more uric acid through their kidneys than other people.  However, we don't really know why some people get gout and others don't.  If you have questions about your own health history or gout medications, the best thing to do is see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss further.  He or she can go over your medications to help determine what you will need to take and for how long to prevent any further gout flares.  Sometimes people with severe gout can also be referred to a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> for further management."
Is there a cure for arthritis?,"Thirty is a very young age to be suffering from <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> for most people. While there are obvious exceptions, as in those who have different medical conditions pre-disposing them to arthritis, or in those who have used their hands very heavily when they were younger, it would be uncommon for a 30 year old to have severe arthritis pains. You should speak with your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> about your symptoms, and you may even need to speak with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> to determine if there is a reason that your symptoms are more prominent than those of others your age. There are arthritides related to age (such as osteoarthritis) and others which have a medical basis (such as rheumatoid arthritis). If you do, indeed, have normal, run of the mill osteoarthritis, then there is much that can be done for it. Anti-inflammatory drugs are a great start, and there are exercises that you can do to help your joints maintain their optimal health. Other tricks such as hot and cold treatments can also offer some short term benefit. For most people in this situation, however, this will be a life-long trial that they will have to deal with to some degree. Please speak with your doctor. "
Is my arthritis causing my shoulder pain?,"I would highly suggest that you get in to see your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. Any persistent or new pain in the bones should be investigated to make sure it is not a serious medical problem. 

In your case, of course ruling out a flare of juvenile <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> is important. The likelihood of this will depend somewhat on what your experience with the arthritis has been so far. Your doctor will examine the shoulder and may also want to get some basic blood work to look for inflammation or infection. 

In additional to juvenile arthritis, there are the more common causes of shoulder pain in young people. In particular, strains or sprains are quite common, and they typically occur either with repetitive motions, heavy lifting, or sports injuires. Therefore, make sure to tell your doctor when you go to see them exactly where the pain is and how it started (for example, falls or sports activities are very important to mention). Based on the information you give your doctor and their examination of your shoulder, they should be able to narrow down the potential causes of your discomfort and give you some recommendations about treatment. "
Anything I can do for ankylosing spondylitis?,"Ankylosing spondylitis is a condition that involves inflammation in the spine and can cause back pain that can be quite severe.  The disease causes inflammation and subsequent fusion of the vertebrae causing a very stiff back that can be painful.  The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is a bit complex, but involves looking at x-rays of the back, and seeing the progression of the disease over time.  In addition, there is a genetic test that each person that is suspected to have ankylosing spondylitis should have.  Over 90% of patients with this disease have a gene called HLA B27.  The HLA B27 gene is an immune system gene that increases the likelihood that one will develop this disease.  

If you do have ankylosing spondylitis, you should be followed by a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  This is a specialist that deals with these types of inflammatory diseases and will be best equipped to recommend and initiate treatment.  While I think that it is good news that your pain has cleared up, affirming your diagnosis is important.  The rheumatologist will be able to give you the <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> that you are looking for.  Be sure to bring with you any x-rays of your back, and be prepared to be tested for the HLA B27 gene."
Do I have Reiter's syndrome?,"Reiter's syndrome (also known as reactive arthritis) is a complex condition involving infection, joint pain, urinary symptoms, and problems with vision.  It is a condition that can often start off as an infection with the bacteria chlamydia.  In people with a certain gene, this infection causes a chain reaction that causes urethritis (painful urination), swollen joints (often in the knee), and uveitis (an inflamed eye).  If your only symptom is pain and swelling around your left ankle joint, then Reiter's syndrome is not the first problem that I would look into.  This is because pain and swelling in the ankle has many other possible causes other than Reiter's syndrome.  The most common cause of this problem is trauma to your ankle.  If you recently twisted your ankle or stepped on your foot in the wrong way, then this is the most likely cause of your symptoms.  Other possibilities include <a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">gout</a> (which is caused by uric acid crystals) and infection of the joint.  Both of these require immediate attention by a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a>.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> for this ankle.  The reason I think you should see a specialist is that I think you may need fluid drained from your ankle joint in order to make a diagnosis.  A rheumatologist is the best physician to perform this procedure.  "
What causes high levels of uric acid?,"I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from problems with <a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">gout</a>! You are correct that there is an association between high levels of uric acid and gout, and reducing your uric acid levels can help to prevent flares of gout. This is definitely an issue that you should manage in consultation with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, as they will be able to give you advice over the years about the condition. 

Uric acid levels are in part controlled by genetics, and there is not much you can do about that. However, uric acid levels are also associated with being overweight and with drinking alcohol, which are two things that you should be able to work on. Higher uric acid levels are also associated with eating certain kinds of food, especially foods rich in protein. 

One excellent strategy would be to meet with your primary care doctor or a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> to discuss the specifics of a diet that your can follow that will reduce your risk of gout attacks. 

Furthermore, if you have repeated gout attacks, it may be necessary to take a regular medication to reduce your uric acid levels, and this is something your primary care doctor can discuss with you. "
Can children get arthritis?,"<a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">Arthritis</a> is a medical term that refers to inflammation in the joints. The inflammation often results in pain (medically known as arthralgias). I would recommend that you take your son to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. He or she can better evaluate the complaints that he is.

To answer your question -- YES -- children can and unfortunately do get arthritis. This is often different than the arthritis that we think of when thinking of adults. This type of arthritis that many people develop in old age is actually osteoarthritis -- a disease of wear and tear on the joints. Children do not get this unless there is a specific <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> or body deformation that causes an abnormality of the joint function.

But there are other causes of joint inflammation (or arthritis) that children can get. For example, autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis can occur -- in which the body's immune system accidentally attacks the joints. There is a variant of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis -- although often this occurs with significant fevers. There are other causes which should be evaluated because if there is joint inflammation this can cause long term joint damage.

There are other causes (for example ""growth pains"") that may be responsible. Please discuss this with his pediatrician for more information."
How do you know if someone has lupus?,"Lupus, or systemic lupus erythematous or SLE, is a relatively common <a href=""/procedure/auto-immune-disorder-1197"">autoimmune disorder</a>. It can have a wide variety of symptoms or in some cases be relatively asymptomatic. That being said, it is an extremely serious condition that requires evaluation and potential treatment as it can otherwise lead to damage of multiple organs. I would recommend that your brother have a formal evaluation by his primary care <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a>.

Lupus can result in many symptoms. The major symptoms that people describe are sun sensitivity, oral ulcers, skin ulceration or rash, chest pain, changes in thinking and joint pain. <a href=""/procedure/muscle-pain-1024"">Muscle pain</a> is a more rare symptom than joint pain. A classic rash over the nose and face (known as a malar rash) is sometimes seen.

There are many abnormalities on testing that your doctor can look for. Changes in kidney function, changes in blood cells and changes in inflammation markers is often seen.

The best lab test to diagnosis lupus is a set of antibodies. These are known as the Anti double stranded DNA and the Anti Smith antibodies. Keep in mind that these alone don't make the diagnosis, but if they are positive with the other symptoms and findings mentioned above -- this may be consistent with lupus.

Have your brother see his doctor for more information. "
What should be avoided if someone has gout?,"<a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">Gout</a> can be a very painful condition that can be the cause of significant pain and even disability for affected patients.  If your husband is concerned that he could be suffering from gout, he should definitely be evaluated by his physician. A <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> can perform a preliminary exam--gout usually leads to very characteristic inflammation in swelling in affected joints--and decide if referral to a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatology specialist</a> is warranted.

Overall, gout is a condition caused by the accumulation of excessive uric acid in the body.  Uric acid is a byproduct of DNA breakdown, and patients with gout have trouble getting rid of excess uric acid.  The excess urate can crystallize within joints (most classically the big toes, but can affect others as well) and cause a very painful swelling of the joint.

When it comes to dietary factors, there are several things associated with both an increase and decrease in the risk of a gouty flare.  First, consumption of alcohol, meat, and seafood can lead to an increase in gouty attacks.  However, a diet high in Vitamin C, coffee, and dairy products may help lower the risk.  Gout is typically managed with medications and lifestyle modification, so it is important for your husband to be evaluated by a physician to determine a) if he has gout and b) how to manage it most effectively."
How can I prevent muscle cramping?,"Most muscle cramps are benign and are not a major medical problem. In fact, the most common cause of muscle cramps is over exercising. I am not sure what your exercise regimen is like, but that is the first place I would look. Particularly if you notice that the cramps are occurring more in mornings after having exercised vigorously the day before, this is almost certainly what is going on. 

You can minimize exercise related cramping by making sure not to overtrain. It can also be helpful to engage in cross training, to make sure that different muscle groups are being exercised equally. Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated will also minimize cramping, as will gentle stretching after finishing your workout routine. 

Even if you are not vigorously exercising, it is likely that your morning cramps are still related to residual stiffness in the muscles from the previous day's activities. You may want to start your morning with some very light movement and stretching in order to help prevent the cramping.

If these strategies don't work, then you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who will be able to make certain there is not something more serious going on. "
Is my chronic muscle soreness a sign of ALS?,"There are several reasons why you could be having muscle soreness. Medically known as myalgia, it is a symptom of several different disorders. Generally, when someone presents with myalgia, the most common reason is generally muscle strain or injury to the muscles. 

However, muscle soreness or pain can also occur with chronic tension, viral illnesses and as a side effect of medications. Most commonly implicated medications are cholesterol lowering drugs called statins. Some electrolyte disorders can also manifest as <a href=""/procedure/muscle-pain-1024"">muscle pain</a>. Infections can also cause muscle soreness as a symptom, for example, the flu. Finally yes, muscle disorders such as ALS can cause myalgias also. ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease is due to nerve degeneration and is notable for progressive muscle weakness, muscle loss and eventually difficulty with muscles of breathing. It is generally a diagnosis that requires significant testing and ruling out of other causes.

It is important for you to make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss your symptoms. A doctor will be able to take a detailed medical history, ask specific questions about other symptoms such as fevers or changes in weight or muscle weakness. In addition to taking this detailed history, a physical examination will be performed. Your doctor can provide a diagnosis of what is responsible for your symptoms and make the referral to a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> if needed."
Why would I have soreness on one side of my body only?,"It is not unusual to wake up with an achy or sore feeling on just one side or in one particular area. What your daily activities are, and how fatigued you are may affect how you feel or sleep at night. Do you sleep in any one particular position? If not, do you tend to roll around in bed a lot, until you find a restful position? Since you relate this to waking up, it is most likely a positional situation with you laying on that side more often.

I would advise you to see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> so that you can go over your specific symptoms in greater detail. Your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> will be able to ask specific questions and tailor a diagnosis based on those symptoms. A physical examination of your musculoskeletal system is also essential in providing a clue to what specifically is going on. If you are working out, you may want to think about whether you focus on your right side more so than your left or if you are lifting heavier weights etc. Generally such aches are related to muscle fatigue and overwork and will usually self-resolve themselves. "
Why would I be experiencing joint pain all of the sudden?,"From your brief history describing the symptoms, you may have a joint pain condition known as septic <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>.   Septic arthritis is inflammation of a joint that develops when bacteria, or less commonly fungi, spread through the bloodstream to a joint.  The infection may occur elsewhere in your body, such as an upper respiratory tract infection or urinary tract infection, that spreads through your bloodstream to a joint.  (In younger sexually active people, gonorrhea is a potential cause of septic arthritis).  The most common sites for this type of infection are the knee and hip, though other joints can be affected by septic arthritis, including your ankle, wrist, elbow and shoulder.  Symptoms usually come on quickly and suddenly.  Do you have other accompanied symptoms such as fever and chills, joint swelling that is usually in just one joint, and an intense joint pain, which gets worse, especially when you move that joint?   If treated within a week after symptoms first appear, you very likely make a complete recovery.  If severe, you may need surgery to drain the infected joint fluid.  The infection spreads rapidly so prompt treatment may prevent permanent damage to your affected joints.  I recommend that you make an appointment with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> to confirm the diagnosis and be treated IMMEDIATELY.     "
What are the symptoms of gout?,"Gout is a chronic condition of arthritis characterized by an overproduction of uric acid in the blood to form urate crystals that accumulate around the joints, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack.  Therefore, if you have a high level of uric acid you are likely to develop gout.  Excessive alcohol use, genetics, certain medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis), age and gender (male between the ages of 40 to 50) are risk factors.  Gout does involve pain in the big toe, which is also known as podagra.  In addition to the big toe, the knee and ankle are the primary areas where gout symptoms are present.  It can also occur in hands and wrists.  Gout symptoms and signs can present in a number of ways.  The most usual is a recurrent attack of pain, redness and tenderness in joints.  The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that an acute attack can make you feel like your big toe is on fire.  <a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">Joint pain</a> usually begins over 2-4 hours and the onset is often at night due to the lower body temperature.   The pain is likely to be most severe within the first 12 to 24 hours after it begins.  Joint pain may occur along with fatigue and a high <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> which can be a sign of infection.  I would recommend that you schedule a visit with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> soon to confirm the diagnosis and seek treatment.  Untreated gout can lead to serious complications.  "
Is the soreness in my wrist carpal tunnel syndrome?,"Carpal tunnel is made up of the arching carpal bones, or eight bones in the wrist, and the connecting ligament.  A major nerve called median nerve that connects from the brain and spinal cord down to the fingertips travels down the arm and enters the hand through carpal tunnel.  Carpal tunnel syndrome arises when a median nerve in your wrist becomes pinched to trigger a progressively painful hand and arm condition.  A number of factors that can contribute to a carpal tunnel syndrome include certain underlying medical problems and possible patterns of hand use.  Carpal tunnel syndrome starts gradually with a vague aching in your wrist that can radiate up your forearm to your shoulder or down into your hand or fingers.  Initial symptoms are also numbness and <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a> in your hand or fingers, especially your thumb, index, middle and part of the ring fingers, but not your little finger.  These sensations are more intense at night that can awaken you from sleep.   As the disease advances, you can develop a burning sensation, occasionally sharp shooting pains in the forearm, and a weakness in your hands that decreases your grip strength leading you to frequent dropping of objects.   If you experience persistent signs and symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome, I would recommend a visit with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> soon.  If the condition is not treated, permanent deterioration of nerve and muscle may occur."
Can hemophilia cause arthritis symptoms?,"I cannot say whether or not all of your grandson's <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> symptoms have always been from hemophilia, because it is possible that he had more than one condition. However, what I can say is that hemophilia is definitely associated with arthritis symptoms over time. 

Hemophilia causes arthritis symptoms because the trouble with blood clotting that comes with the disease leads to bleeding from time to time into the joints. This bleeding can lead to scarring and degenerative changes in the joint space, causing chronic stiffness and pain. The best way to prevent arthritis from hemophilia is to treat the hemophilia well with replacement of the necessary clotting factors, which will prevent bleeding. 

Your grandson will need to be managed closely by a pediatric <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a>, who is an expert in treating clotting disorders like hemophilia. They will come up with a plan to control his tendency to bleed. At the same time, if your grandson has significant arthritis symptoms, he probably should also continue to see a pediatric <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>, or joint specialist. They will be able to help manage any symptoms of arthritis from hemophilia; as well, they will be able to evaluate and rule out any other potential causes of arthritis. "
What's wrong with me if tests for rheumatoid arthritis keep coming back normal?,"<a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">Joint pain</a> in a young female has many different possible causes other than rheumatoid <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>.  Without knowing what tests you had, it is impossible for me to narrow down the possibilities.  Assuming that only rheumatoid arthritis was tested for, there are other possible tests that should be done to rule in or rule out other causes of joint pain.

While rheumatoid arthritis is probably the most common cause of inflammatory joint pain in a young female, other causes such as psoriatic arthritis and lupus arthritis should be considered.  In some people, joint pain can be the primary symptom in both of these diseases.  The blood test for these two is slightly different than the test for rheumatoid arthritis.

Another possibility is you have caught an infection that is causing the arthritis.  In the northeast, infections with the tic borne lyme disease are common, and can cause joint pain among many other symptoms.   

Since you have had this pain for a while without any answers, I think it is appropriate for you to jump to seeing a specialist.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  He or she will know what tests are necessary in your case to determine the cause of your joint pain. "
Can Sj?gren's Syndrome affect my joints?,"As you know, dry eyes and dry mouth are two of the principle symptoms that patient's with Sjogren's syndrome suffer from.  The disease is a type of autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the ducts that make saliva for the mouth, and tears for the eyes.  Many people with Sjogren's syndrome also have other signs and symptoms that are suggestive of other organ system involvement.  There are not many organs that Sjogren's syndrome cannot affect.  However, if you develop a new symptom such as <a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">joint pain</a>, you should not immediately blame Sjogren's because joint pain is not a typical symptom that people get.  Thus, you and your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> should explore other reasons why you are having this pain before deciding that it must be the Sjogren's syndrome.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  He or she can take a look at your past history including which Sjogren's antibodies you have.  In addition, your doctor can listen to your description of the pain and perform a thorough physical exam.  If no other cause of the joint pain can be found, the it is possible that your Sjogren's is not being adequately controlled.  In this case, you and your doctor need to come up with a different treatment strategy.  "
Can lifting weights cause shoulder problems?,"The golden rule with regards to weight lifting or any physical activity is to stop when it hurts. Pain is the body's way of letting us know that we are doing something wrong, or are in danger of causing short term or even permanent damage. 

Some of the earliest warning signs before muscle and ligamentous <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> are the twinges of pain. If you are experiencing pain in your shoulder that seems to be aggravated by your weight lifting, then you should stop your lifting or at least adjust your regimen so that the shoulder is not used in a painful manner. Trying to lift around an injury places additional strain on other muscles that can lead to injury in other ways. 

Additionally, it can create bad lifting habits that are difficult to break. While it is hard for a serious lifter to tolerate taking a break, it is important to realize that working through this type of pain can be very detrimental. Some people find that over the counter pain medications help to ease the inflammation, but one should take care to follow the package directions. If the pain has not resolved or has worsened, you should speak to your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a>. "
Can scleroderma affect my organs as well as my skin?,"<a href=""/procedure/scleroderma-1022"">Scleroderma</a> is a very complex disease that effects people in very different ways.  In general the disease can be divided into two general categories.  1. limited scleroderma, and 2. systemic scleroderma.  The first one primary effects the skin and occasionally another organ.  

Sometimes people with this category of scleroderma get the CREST syndrome.  This syndrome is an acronym for the 5 symptoms: calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal problems, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias.  In layman's terms, this means that your skin will be harder with calcium deposits.  Raynaud's phenomenon is when the fingers get cold and even blue-white in cold weather.  Esophageal problems make it harder to swallow.  Sclerodactyly makes the skin around the fingers taut.  And telangiectasias tiny visible blood vessels in the skin.  Systemic scleroderma affects other internal organs other than the blood vessels and esophagus.  So the answer to your question is yes, scleroderma can affect organs as well as your skin.  

Since you are feeling ill, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  He or she can listen to your description of your symptoms and perform a thorough physical exam.  If your symptoms are do to scleroderma, your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> may want to modify your treatment plan and strategy.  Good luck.  "
Can athletes get rheumatoid arthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease that effects different joints in the body.  It occurs when the body's own immune system begins attacking the lining of the joints.  This causes pain, swelling, morning stiffness, and difficulty doing things with the joints (often the hands).  Unfortunately, being any type of athlete or being in shape does not protect you against rheumatoid arthritis.  It develops on its own.  Effected people are often middle aged women.  

The good news is that the treatment today for rheumatoid arthritis is excellent.  The first line therapy is a drug called methotrexate.  Methotrexate is actually a <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> drug used in cancer.  However, when it is used in extremely small doses, it can treat rheumatoid arthritis with very few side effects if any.  Other new drugs are available as well for the more severe cases.  

I suggest that your mother schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  This is a specialist that only treats inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.  There will be a variety of tests this <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> will want to do prior to starting any treatment.  This is just to verify the diagnosis.  After that, she will be started on a medication (probably methotrexate) with a close followup visit to track her improvement.  "
Can Polymyalgia Rheumatica lead to further complications?,"<a href=""/procedure/polymyalgia-rheumatica-1299"">Polymyalgia Rheumatica</a> (PMR for short) is an inflammatory disease that causes pain that typically occurs in the neck, shoulders, and hips.  It typically occurs in older patients with the average age of onset being about 70 with very few patients ever under the age of 60.  The diagnosis of PMR is done by a physician that recognizes that pattern of pain and orders a blood test for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) both of which are elevated.  No surgery is required for treatment of PMR.  The treatment of this disease is prednisone which works very well.  In fact, prednisone is so effective at treating PMR, that if a patient does not get better, then the diagnosis is likely something else.  

Since you have a strong family history of this disorder, you should definitely watch out for the symptoms as you approach age 60 and beyond.  The type of <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> that you would want to schedule an appointment with is a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  This is a specialist who has done extra training in inflammatory diseases such as PMR.  They will know what type of diagnostic tests should be ordered and what treatments will be best in your situation.  Good luck.  "
How is polymyalgia rheumatica treated?,"<a href=""/procedure/polymyalgia-rheumatica-1299"">Polymyalgia rheumatica</a> (PMR) is a disease characterized by pain in multiple areas.  The joints/muscles that are effected most often are the shoulder joints and the hip joints.  Although the exact cause is unknown, the pain that comes from PMR is caused by inflammation in these areas.  PMR effects mostly patients over the age of 60, with the average age being 70.  Thus, it is a disease that is quite rare in young people.  PMR is diagnosed through with a qualified physician listening to the pattern of symptoms.  

A blood test for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level which should both be elevated.  In some cases, PMR can be associated with another disease called temporal arteritis.  Temporal arteritis is another inflammatory disease which cause blindness in one eye.  The treatment for PMR is prednisone, a steroid anti-inflammatory.  Prednisone works so well for PMR that when a person does not get near complete relief from their symptoms with the medication, the diagnosis of PMR is likely wrong.  While exercise is never discouraged, and would likely not hurt, it would not be the only therapy needed for PMR.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  This <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> can review your workup so far and recommend treatment.  Good luck.  "
Can Lupus Erythematosus cause joint pain?,"The short answer to you question is yes, lupus erythematosus can cause <a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">joint pain</a>.  The diagnosis of lupus is complex, and involves a lot more than just a bad reaction to the sun.  Lupus erythematosus is actually a collection of a few related disorders that can have different symptoms.  One key part of the diagnosis is the presence of an abnormal antibody in your blood called the anti-nuclear antibody.  In order for your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> to make this diagnosis, he or she would have had to draw blood work that detected this antibody.  One of the common types of lupus erythematosus is is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  This type of lupus requires four different signs or symptoms be present along with the anti-nuclear antibody.  This diagnosis will carry different implications to your health than say discoid lupus erythematosis, another diagnosis.  The bottom line is that you need to know more information about what you have before you can know what to look for in terms of new symptoms.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  A rheumatologist is an expert in treating patients with this disease.  This doctor will know what types of blood tests to order and what symptoms to look out for.  In addition, you can be started on advanced effective treatment if necessary.  "
Does Lupus Erythematosus target one part of the body?,"The full name for <a href=""/procedure/lupus-erythematosus-sle-1021"">lupus erythematosus</a> is actually systemic lupus erythematosus meaning that the the disease by its very nature affects more than one area of the body i. e. it is systemic.  In fact, part of the usual diagnostic criteria are that multiple sights are affected.  So not only can multiple muscle sites be affected such as the arms and legs, but frequently the skin, kidneys, heart, nervous system, GI tract and the blood.  The overall course of the disease is usually determined by the extent of kidney involvement, with worsening renal functioning portending a worse prognosis.

Depending on how severe your disease you may experience involvement of many organ systems may become involved over the course of your life.  Despite, this not everyone has involvement of all the organ systems listed above.  About 4 out 5 people will have involvement of the skin with slightly more having muscle involvement as you do.  The same amount typically have kidney involvement, and a much smaller percentage, 1 out of 3 have GI involvement.  Finally, half will have involvement of the nervous system.  To prevent these complications it is important to be under the medical care of a physician trained to treat lupus.  A <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> can discuss the best ways to treat your symptoms and answer more of your questions.  Good luck!"
Is joint pain a sign that I may be falling ill?,"<a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">Joint pain</a> can be very frustrating because of the way in which it disrupts the activities of daily life, including work, sleep, and athletic activities.  If you have concerns about your joints or about specific aches and pains, the best place to start is with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can take a thorough history to find out if you have any additional changes in your health or home medications, as well as evaluating your family history.  A physical exam is also an important part of evaluating joint pain.

It is hard to say exactly what is causing your joint pain, but in the absence of fever, chills, muscle aches, contact with someone with the flu, or other similar symptoms, it is unlikely to be influenza.  The list of things that can cause joint pain is rather extensive, and this is why it is important to have your concerns evaluated by someone who can put your symptoms in the context of your overall health.  Overuse injuries from sports or even daily activities can cause joint pain, as can <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> (of which there are several different kinds).  Autoimmune diseases as well as infections can also cause joint pain.  Overall, joint pain is something you want to have evaluated so you can get back to enjoying your life, but is also something that is very common and is not often caused by serious illness. Best of all, many kinds of joint pain can be treated very effectively! Again, talk to your primary care physician for more information."
Does undifferentiated connective tissue disease result in the body attacking itself?,"Undifferentiated connective tissue disease is a ""waste basket diagnosis"" -- meaning a diagnosis we make when your symptoms do not fit a known pattern of a connective tissue disorder. This can result in sever problems to one's health and well being. As such, I would recommend that you discuss this fairly complicated issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. In addition, you may require the advice of a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a> -- a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> who specializes in connective tissue disorders.

Connective tissue disorders are disease of the muscles, joints, ligaments etc. These are often systemic disorders -- meaning that they affect they entire body. The most common mechanism is that of autoimmune abnormality. This is, as you suggest, when the body develop antibodies (attacking proteins) against itself -- instead of against a bacteria or other infecting agent. These float in the blood and can cause problem in many tissues including the muscle, skin and internal organs. Most of them follow a specific pattern, thus a specific diagnosis like lupus or scleroderma or rheumatoid arthritis can be made. However everyone is different and disorders that have similar characteristics but do not follow a known pattern are called ""undifferentiated.""

Treating these disorders is possible. Often medications to fight the immune system (like steroids) can help. That being said, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed (some infections or cancers can look like this). Subsequently, a rheumatologist may start you on some medicine. 

Talk to a rheumatologist."
Is undifferentiated connective tissue disease an autoimmune disease?,"What you are describing is probably a type of autoimmune disease.  A connective tissue disease is a generic term to describe an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues.  An undifferentiated connective tissue disease is a term which basically says that a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> thinks that you have one of these diseases, but no diagnosis has been made yet.  There are many examples of connective tissue diseases including systemic lupus erythematosis, <a href=""/procedure/scleroderma-1022"">scleroderma</a>, and mixed connective tissue disease.  

A connective tissue disease has no relation to AIDS.  AIDS is an immune system deficiency disease caused by the HIV virus.  In some senses, the AIDS and an autoimmune disease are exact opposites.  In the former, the immune system is too weak, and in the later, the immune system is too active.

Connective tissue diseases require a specialist for treatment.  In your case, you should seek care from a specialist to both receive an official diagnosis and to receive treatment.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  The two of you can discuss what diagnostic tests are necessary to give you an official diagnosis which type of connective tissue disease you have.  From there you can be begin treatment that is specific to this disease.  "
Can men get Sjogren's Syndrome?,"Sjogren's syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks certain body parts most importantly the glands in the eyes and mouth that make tears and saliva respectively.  It is known as an autoimmune disease.  Thus, the most common symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome is dry mouth and dry eyes.  Like many autoimmune diseases, Sjogren's syndrome effects women more than men.  More specifically, 90% of the patients that are documented to have this syndrome are women.  The reason for this is unknown, but it most likely is the result of the genetic differences between men and women.  It is for this reason when a women presents to me with dry eyes and dry mouth symptoms, I am much more suspicious of Sjogren's than I would be if it were a man. 

The best type of physician to see for Sjogren's is a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>.  Reumatologists have the training and expertise to treat this disease with the best and newest medications available.  With the right treatment, a patient with Sjogren's may be able to lead a healthy life with many of the symptoms controlled.  Thank you for participating in this help group.  I hope that helped answer you question. "
Can Sjogren's Syndrome lead to dryness in places other than my mouth and eyes?,"Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition that involves the body mounting attacks on glands that produce lubricating secretions, mostly inside body cavities. As these glands are attacked, the production of the secretions tapers off, producing dryness of the surfaces previously lubricated by the glands. 

Classically Sjogren's syndrome affects the eyes and the mouth, reducing tears and saliva. This can cause many complications, including that it may predispose you to infections or damage to the surface of the eye, dental infections, fungal infections of the mouth. This dryness can be also very uncomfortable, although it can usually be managed with artificial tears and artificial saliva. 

Less common, but also possible, is similar involvement of other body areas. For example, in women vaginal dryness and discomfort may be a problem. Similarly dysfunction of mucus glands in the lungs and airways may cause a chronic cough and predispose to lung infections, chronic <a href=""/procedure/sinus-problems-116"">sinus problems</a>, and the like. 

If you are having difficulty with symptoms of dryness in these other areas, then I suggest talking to your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>, or whichever <a href=""/rheumatologists"">doctor</a> is managing your Sjogren's treatment. They should be able to suggest some ways to treat these symptoms and prevent complications. "
What can cause a low sex drive?,"A low sex drive is a very common problem, especially prevalent among women in the demographic that you are describing. There are many different causes that can be treated, such as poor health in a specific part of your life or something in the past that may be detracting from your sex life. Any of these can and should be treated, as a low libido can be more of a symptom than a separate condition. For other women, medications that they take, even something as common as birth control, may be the cause of a low libido. Speaking with the prescribing <a href=""/therapist-counselors"">doctor</a> can sometimes suggest changes that may result in an improved sex life.

Often, however, these searches for a simple change are unsuccessful, and there are many factors (including the daily stresses of life) that are to blame for the change or decrease in sex drive. If this is true in your case, there are still things that can be done to help. While there are efforts being made to develop a medication that will help to boost libido, they are still in the early stages. Speaking with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a trained <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or physician may provide some suggestions that add value. Please speak to your doctor--this is a common complaint, and physicians need to know about it in order to help."
I am experiencing black-outs when I try to stand up for more than a few minutes and wonder what specialist I may need to see?,"Dizziness and blacking out are very concerning symptoms in someone your age. You need to have someone take you to the emergency room immediately for evaluation.

There are several possible causes of these symptoms. For example you say that you are anemic, and severe <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a> can produce dizziness. Additionally, if you are <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> somewhere, for example inside your gastrointestinal tract, this can be quite sudden and severe and lead to a life-threatening amount of blood loss. 

Another possibility would be a stroke, which is damage to nerves in the brain, and can present with dizziness, weakness, slurred speech, confusion, and related symptoms. 

Similarly a heart attack or a problem with the rhythm of the heart could produce dizziness like this, especially if you are also experience chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, or a sensation that your heart is racing or skipping beats. 

Although there are several benign causes of dizziness (such as an inflammation of the inner ear), the serious causes are likely enough that you absolutely must be evaluated as soon as possible by an emergency room <a href=""/emergency-medicine-physicians"">doctor</a>. Given the symptoms, you should not drive yourself, rather you should call an ambulance or have someone else drive you. "
Can whiplash cause nausea?,"Whiplash is an injury where the neck is rapidly extended as often happens during an automobile accident.  It is the result of stretching of the ligaments within the spinal cord.  By definition, it cannot include damage to the nerves that result in long term spinal cord injury.  In contrast, nausea is a complex reaction that can be due to GI track irritation, the sensation of spinning (<a href=""/procedure/vertigo-115"">vertigo</a>), or a central nervous system disorder.  Most cases of nausea originate from the GI track, which would not be effected by whiplash.  The only possible connection between the two is that severe pain can sometimes create a nervous reaction that results in nausea.  It would be unusual for you to develop this a few weeks after your accident.  

Nevertheless, I think it would be a good idea for you to consult with a physician.  Your two best options are for you to present to the emergency room (Emergency physicians are very adept at dealing with these types of injuries) or for you to present to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  It is possible that your waves of nausea are do to a GI virus and your primary care physician would be the best type of <a href=""/emergency-medicine-physicians"">doctor</a> to see for this.  "
Can fevers cause bloating?,"Fever does not in and of itself cause abdominal bloating. Rather, fever is one of the body's primary symptoms that something, usually an infection, is going on. Therefore it is very likely that whatever is causing your husband's abdominal bloating is also causing the fever. 

There are many infections that can cause these symptoms, including bacteria and viruses. Usually most of these infections are self limited and not too severe. Usually, a few days of rest and taking in lots of fluids is enough to fight them off. However, if your husband has any other medical problems, or if the fever is not improving, if there is severe <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, or if there is blood in the bowel movements these are all some signs that things are more serious and that he should seek medical care .

Occasionally, a surgical problem can cause fever and abdominal pain. These would include <a href=""/procedure/appendicitis-appendectomy-1074"">appendicitis</a>, an inflammation of the appendix, which requires <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to remove the inflamed organ. If your husband has severe abdominal pain, especially in the right lower part of the abdomen, or if you notice that the abdominal wall muscles seem stiff and tight, these are signs that you need to go to the emergency room. 
"
Can lymph nodes swell due to a tattoo infection?,"It is normal for a tattoo to be a little tender and swollen for a few days after having it done. Usually, however, this is limited to about the severity (in terms of redness, warmth, and pain) to a sunburn. Definitely the area of redness should not spread much beyond the actual tattoo. 

The fact that you have a swollen lymph node is concerning. As you know, the lymph nodes are involved in draining infections from the skin and other parts of the body, and the lymph nodes behind your ear do drain some of the skin of the back of the neck. So, having a swollen gland here could be a sign of an infection. 

Other signs of infection to look out for would be worsening pain, spreading of the area of redness and warmth beyond the area of the tattoo, and <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. This type of infection, which is an infection of the skin, would be called cellulitis. 

It is advisable that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or even an emergency room doctor to have the area checked out and to make certain that it is not infected, as you may require antibiotic therapy to clear up the area in the case of an infection. "
Should I take my daughter in for pacifier habit counseling once she turns three?,"While the exact age at which to intervene on those children who practice non-nutritive sucking (such as pacifiers, thumbs, etc) is somewhat debated, it is generally considered to start intervening at about the age of 3, as you suggest. 

Before that time, it is difficult to understand and to teach young children. The consequences of continuing to suck thumbs or pacifiers include increased rates of ear infection, other types of infection, and possibly even the potential for deformity of the facial bones due to the constant forces that are applied. 

Fortunately for you, children who suck a pacifier are generally much easier to wean from this than are those who suck their thumbs. There are many strategies that your doctor or <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> will be able to recommend, including everything from positive reinforcement to dental devices that make it difficult for the child to suck his or her thumb. 

Additionally, your health care professional will be able to speak at an appropriate and authoritative level to your child so that they are even more likely to respond appropriately. Please speak to your <a href=""/pediatric-dentists"">pediatric dentist</a> or <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about helping your child to stop sucking on her pacifier. "
Does my 12 year old require thumb habit counseling?,"Yes. While there has been much debate about when to intervene on children with regards to non-nutritive sucking, the age of 12 is decidedly too old to continue the habit. Thumb sucking (or any such repetitive oral behavior) can lead to multiple long term consequences, some of which you may have noticed already. In addition to the spread of disease,increased infections, and the effect on dentition, the chronic force of repetitive thumb sucking can cause alterations in the development of the bony anatomy of the face. At the age of 12, this may have already occurred to some degree. 

Rapid intervention at this point will prove critical to avoiding further problems. Additionally, this behavior is likely to become a social issue as well, with teasing from peers obviously taking a role in her personal development. Fortunately, there is much that can be done. Speak to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about the problem. Depending on what you have tried previously, there are multiple options available. 

Some of these may even include wearing an oral device that makes it difficult for her to suck her thumb. While it may be difficult in the short term, please speak to your pediatrician soon about this problem. "
At what age should I take my chid in for thumb habit counseling?,"Non-nutritive sucking (any sucking behavior that is done habitually or during stressful situations as a coping mechanism) is a very common problem. Whether it be the pacifier, the thumb, or anything else, it can have numerous effects on the development of the facial anatomy, the incidence of ear infections, and the spread of other disease as well. 

Furthermore, it is a social problem as well, leading to teasing at school and on the playground, as your son has no doubt already learned. While there has been much debate about the correct age to intervene, it is generally agreed that it is appropriate to begin to seek the help of a medical professional at about the age of 3, and there is little debate about beginning therapy at a point before the permanent teeth have come in. 

Given that your son is 8 already, he needs to speak with his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or pediatric <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> soon. There are many methods that can be used to help, including the temporary placement of a device that makes it difficult to suck the thumb. Please speak to your pediatrician soon about helping your son to stop this habit. "
Should my child have a pediatric dental consultation for fillings?,"I would recommend that you have your child see a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. More specifically, a <a href=""/pediatric-dentists"">pediatric dentist</a> is a dentist who specializes in teeth maintenance and treatment in children. 

Baby teeth, or primary teeth, will fall out over late childhood. These temporary or deciduous teeth are important for the child in order to allow for normal biting and mouth hygiene. 

If your child's teeth look like they have cavities and may require <a href=""/procedure/filling-14"">filling</a>, it is unlikely that the dentist will place a filling. That being said there is still a very important need to see the dentist. Firstly, it is important to evaluate the teeth. Cavities are not extremely common in primary teeth and therefore anything that looks abnormal should be evaluated. Secondly, introducing appropriate tooth maintenance is very important at an early age. If your child is developing problems with their teeth early, it then becomes even more important to teach appropriate tooth care. The third reason to see the dentist is because tooth abnormalities can become painful. If there is a problem with the teeth in a young child, he or she can change their eating and chewing pattern and thereby cause long term problem with their chewing. As such, treating abnormalities before they become painful or impactful is important.

I would recommend a dental consultation."
How can I get my child to sit still for his pediatric dental cleaning?,"Having a child with ADHD can be difficult for many different reasons, most of which you are able to deal with as they arise on a regular basis. Dental and other medical visits pose a unique challenge, in that the success of the visit relies to a great extent on the cooperation of your child during the appointment. Fortunately, there is a group of dentists that specialize in dealing with children, and have extensive experience with children similar to your son. 

Pediatric dentists are trained with how to improve the encounter and accomplish what needs to be done with even the most difficult patients. Furthermore, a large part of their training is focused on special needs children or those with difficulties visiting a regular <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. Finding a good <a href=""/pediatric-dentists"">pediatric dentist</a> who comes highly recommended will go a long ways towards improving the experience. These dentists are also able to recommend and use minor sedation when the need arises, as it sometimes does in the most difficult patients. 

Finally, a calm and positive attitude on your part will help your child to be on his best behavior. Please discuss your concerns with your child's dentist and find if he or she has any further recommendations, but don't avoid taking your child to the dentist because of concerns about his behavior. As medical professionals, we've seen worse."
What are the benefits of milk tooth fillings?,"To best answer this question, a little more information would be required. Has your child been diagnosed with cavities in his milk teeth or has he just noticed pain with eating and drinking hot or cold food? Does you child brush his teeth and floss as instructed to by your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>? Does your child have any visible cavities, chipped, broken or discolored teeth? 

These are questions that are very important to discuss with your <a href=""/pediatric-dentists"">pediatric dentist</a> as he or she will use this information, as well as your child's medical history and pertinent clinical exam to decide upon the appropriate work up. This may include imaging studies and perhaps a referral to a specialist if deemed medically necessary. There are indeed indications for fillings being placed for milk teeth which include decreasing the risk of systemic infection, decreasing the pain associated with eating and drinking, amongst a variety of other concerns.

It is best to be evaluated by a pediatric dentist and have these specific discussions because it is difficult to ascertain over the internet what the difficulties are with your child's teeth and this may be something serious that should be evaluated by your child's dentist."
Do children need milk tooth fillings?,"I would definitely follow your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>'s advice. I certainly do see your point about wondering why <a href=""/procedure/filling-14"">filling</a> baby teeth would be important, given that they will eventually fall out anyway. 

However, the main issue is that if there is a significant cavity, this could potentially lead to a more serious tooth infection. Tooth infections in children are important and should not be ignored for several reasons. 

First, any pain that your child feels from the tooth could affect their ability to eat. This could have serious implications for their nutrition and for healthy growth and development. 

Secondly, a serious tooth infection in the a baby tooth can pass all the way through the tooth and affect the forming bud of the adult tooth that lies just under the baby tooth. Therefore, an untreated infected baby tooth could actually have negative consequences for the permanent adult teeth. 

Finally, an unchecked tooth infection could lead to a more serious body-wide infection, for example if the bacteria in the tooth infection get into the blood stream of your child. 

Talk to your dentist about your concerns, and I am sure they will be happy to explain why they think filling the tooth is important. "
"Sharp pain in right side, migraines, weight loss no appetite?","If you have been seeing your primary care or specialist <a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a> regularly through this process, and the tests are all coming back negative, then that is very encouraging, because it means that there is probably not a serious underlying undiscovered medical process at work. 

I would suggest taking a step back and working with your doctors to see if all of these symptoms might be in some way related to your fibromyalgia and mood symptoms. People who have a diagnosis of fibromyalgia often a disturbance in the way their bodies process pain signals, which can lead to a lot of diffuse pain symptoms. These pain symptoms that are chronic and unrelieved can in turn trigger a deterioration of mood symptoms, which then worsen the pain symptoms, and so on. Breaking out of this cycle usually requires a multidisciplinary team, which can include a fibromyalgia or <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a> as well as a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. In addition, complementary therapies, such as exercise, meditation, and the like are also very helpful. 

I would start by seeing if you can discuss the whole complex of your symptoms the doctor who knows you best and who is treating your fibromyalgia, to see if this idea makes sense."
Is there a certain point when Cymbalta no longer helps fibromyalgia?,"I recommend that you make an appointment to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue - or your <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>, if your fibromyalgia is being treated by a specialist. 

As you probably know, the pain and other symptoms associated with fibromyalgia are complex and multifactorial. Therefore, if your pain symptoms are coming back after a long remission, then it is time for a full medical check up to help figure out what might be different now. 

Cymbalta and other medications like it are often used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, and they can be effective for some people. Sometimes, a tolerance to the medication does build up, and this can require increasing the dosage in order to have a good effect. On the other hand, sometimes adding a different medication or changing to a different medication entirely might be the way your doctor decides to go. 

It is also important to pay attention to the life style factors that influence fibromyalgia, such as sleep, exercise, diet and stress. If any of these factors have gotten out of balance in the last year, then the worsening of your symptoms might be more related to this than to the medication no longer working. Again, please see your doctor soon."
Aching in my thumb and wrist. What to do?,"I would definitely set up a visit with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to talk about this issue, especially since it seems to have been going on for a while and is not getting better. Your doctor can perform a physical exam and narrow down the possible causes of your pain and also suggest treatments. 

One potential cause here is <a href=""/procedure/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-1090"">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, which is a condition caused by inflammation in the nerves in the wrist due to repetitive motion and strain. With carpal tunnel syndrome, the pain, weakness, and (sometimes) <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> and tingling tend to be worse on the thumb side of the hand, just as you are describing. Usually, the condition can be treated with regular doses of anti inflammatory medications, as prescribed by your doctor, together with splinting of the wrists (especially at night) and avoidance of the the activities that bring out the pain (for example, typing at a computer keyboard). 

Another condition which can also cause pain in this area of the wrist is tendonitis at the base of the thumb, which is caused by the same sorts of things that cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Typically tendonitis is also treated with splinting, physical therapy, and anti inflammatory medications. 

Please talk to your doctor!"
Is Arnica a safe way to treat a sore back muscle?,"Arnica is a plant that is commonly used in the treatment of low back pain and other forms of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Most commonly it is applied to the area of interest in a gel form, although other forms of use also exist, include homeopathic preparations. 

There are not any very good scientific studies that look at the effects of arnica on back pain. Most likely, it has some mild effects in relieving pain, although they are probably less pronounced that some other remedies, such as standard pain killers. At the very least, topical arnica preparations are unlikely to cause any harm to you when used exactly as directed. 

Arnica should not be thought of as a replacement for the treatment for sore back muscles that have been shown to be very effective, namely back stretching and strengthening exercises and early mobilization and exercise. 

I recommend that you discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, because they will be able to help you develop an overall plan for how to go about treating your back pain, which can probably include use of Arnica. Subsequently, they will be able to follow along and make sure that your symptoms are improving!"
Is it okay to work out if I am still sore from an injury?,"You ask an excellent question!  The last thing you want to do while being active and staying healthy is re-injure yourself.  Determining whether or not it is safe for you to continue to exercise depends upon the extent of your initial <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>.  Some degree of muscle 'soreness' can be normal after intense activity, but if you have strained or sprained a muscle from activity, you may need a more prolonged period of rest and even physical therapy to get back to normal.  If you have not seen a physician with your initial injury, it would be a good idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss your concerns about returning to activity as well as a possible physical therapy referral.  Even if you don't think your strain is that severe, working with a <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> can be an excellent way to expedite the healing process as well as giving you stretches and flexibility exercises to help improve the balance and alignment of your major muscle groups and joints to help prevent injuries like these in the future.  In addition, therapists or your physician can help go over your activities and help suggest other modes of exercising that might not strain your hamstring as much as your regular activity.  Good luck getting back to your active lifestyle!"
How long does a muscle strain take to heal?,"Sports injuries can be very frustrating since they can sometimes keep you from doing the activities that you enjoy.  If you are still having pain with activity several days after an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, it is a good idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. He or she can examine your leg and find out more about the initial injury in order to determine whether any further treatment is needed.  With some <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a> or sprain injuries, physical therapy can sometimes help with the healing process and prevent future injury. Your primary care physician can let you know if this might be helpful.

Overall, muscle sprains can take time to heal, sometimes as long as days to weeks depending upon the initial injury.  Stretching before and after activity can help the healing process and prevent future injuries.  Heat or ice applied before or after activity can also be helpful, as can mild anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen to help with pain and discomfort.  However, if you have an injury that is bothering you enough to consider even mild over-the-counter medications, it is generally a good idea to make an appointment with your physician for a more thorough history and exam."
Should my grandmother have therapeutic exercise after her knee replacement?,"Exercise after a knee replacement is a very important part of the healing process. To answer your question -- YES -- it is not only recommended but essential that therapeutic exercises are started in order to allow for the best possible recovery of function after the knee replacement. I would recommend that you discuss this with your grandmother's <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a>. He or she will most likely refer your grandmother to a <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> -- who will be able to formally discuss what exercises are best for your grandmother and tailor a specific regimen for her.

The goal of a knee replacement is to allow for the patient to regain function of the joint. While relieving pain is a big part, the reason we ask people to take the risk of the operation is so that they can function and be able to walk or exercise. 

After the operation, the bone and joint is hopefully now functional. But the muscle surrounding the joint must be retrained to work on the joint. A physical therapist can give exercises to strengthen the surrounding muscles (like the quadriceps, hamstrings and calf). Without these exercises the knee joint cannot function normally because the surrounding muscles are not functional.

Talk to your surgeon for more information."
Will a physical therapy follow up provide me with a regimen?,"Physical therapy, or PT, is the specialty associated with the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system and its interaction with physical movement.  The goal of physical therapy is the restoration of maximal functional independence to each patient.  Physical therapists use various modalities to achieve this goal such as exercise, massage, electricity, and heat and cold.  

Your <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> will discuss your goals with you and arrange a treatment plan to accomplish these goals.  This almost always includes a regimen of exercises and stretching movements that you are expected to do at home between your sessions.  This is often just as important as the work that you do at your sessions.  

Please talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or specialist, who can recommend a physical therapist that would be appropriate for you to see for your specific condition.  You usually need a prescription for physical therapy.  You may also do research on which facility or therapist you would be most comfortable with.  I also recommend that you do research on your specific condition that you will be treated for as knowledge is very important, not only in the treatment of your current condition, but also in the prevention of further <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> or aggravation of your symptoms.  "
Will a physiatry follow up tell my uncle more about his stroke?,"Physiatrists are specialist in the movement and function of the body. Also known as Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specialist (or PMR specialist), these doctors work with patients who have physical abnormalities. As you mention, these doctor can certainly help stroke patients. I would recommend that he keep his appointment.

PMR specialists are very helpful with stroke patients. They work with <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapists</a>, speech therapists and swallow therapists to help a patient's physical function. They often help drastically with the physical recovery. While a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> (brain doctor) takes for the stroke itself and preventing further damage, the physiatrist will help more with practical recovery. Therefore, to answer your question, the physiatrist will help with practical aspects of your uncle's recovery. The physiatrist would be helpful in speech therapy by coordinating with a speech <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a>. In addition, some medications can be helpful. For physical problems, they coordinate with physical therapists and home safety assessors to allow for a transition back to as much function as possible. If you require more information regarding the stroke itself, the neurologist would likely be more helpful. 

A physiatry evaluation would be helpful. He or she can help determine how much follow up would be beneficial for your uncle's condition. Good luck!"
Will pediatric physical therapy help my son walk on his own?,"Physical therapy is a vital part of any treatment regimen designed to help patients recover their full function or at least obtain as much as possible. While it is often only a part of the treatment, it is essential that your son continue to work with the therapists as directed by his <a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a>. Physical therapy offers the strengthening and conditioning exercises that are necessary to overcome whatever limitations may be affecting your son currently, but it is important to note that the results are often slow to come. 

The results are slow for the same reason that results are slow for the rest of us when we are trying to gain strength, muscle mass, or even lose weight: the body responds to appropriate stress and stimuli by becoming stronger. Your <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical </a><a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> is able to tailor the sessions to an individual regimen that will hopefully allow your son the greatest degree of mobility in the future. If you feel that you are having difficulty attending all of the sessions, or have other concerns about the need for physical therapy, please discuss these with the doctor or doctors who are helping your son with his medical condition. They will be able to address your concerns and provide some outline for anticipated recovery and prognosis. "
Do high heels cause leg pain while walking?,"Leg and back pain can be caused by a large variety of common and not so common insults, and so it is hard to tell if it is the high heels that is the problem without more information. In general, however, if you are doing something that seems to be causing you pain or discomfort, that is the way that your body lets you know that you should stop doing it. If you find that your complaints seem to get better on the days, or at least during the hours, when you aren't wearing heels, and that things get especially bad after a long day on your feet, then taking a brief break from the heels might be a great place to start fixing your problem. 

It is known that the footwear that you choose to wear can have an impact on your posture and comfort, and so modifying what you are wearing to achieve comfort can potentially have a positive impact on your long term well being. The most important thing, of course, is to discuss your problem with a <a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a>. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be able to evaluate you and make recommendations as needed to visit specialists. "
How long will the pain last after breast cancer surgery?,"Post-surgical pain can be very frustrating for patients.  In general it can be hard to predict exactly how long someone's pain and discomfort will last post-<a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, as each person is different and the exact nature of specific surgeries can affect the healing process.

You should be having close follow-up with the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who performed your lumpectomy and he or she should be able to give you a sense of how much tissue was removed during your lumpectomy.  In addition, whether or not you underwent a lymph node dissection can also influence how much healing your body will need to do.  Although the pain can be very frustrating in the beginning, it is important to remember that the healing process starts the minute the surgery is over, and so you should begin to feel better--little by little--every day.

Managing post-op pain is also a very important part of the healing process. You should feel comfortable using the pain medications your physician has prescribed. If the medications are not working (or if they are making you feel too sedated) you should get in touch with the office because there are many different types of pain medication available.  Also, as you mention, using your arm and trying to stay active can also be very helpful in managing pain.  The more you use your body and get back to regular activity, the more you can help accelerate the healing process.  While there are not specific exercises per se for lumpectomy pain, resuming gentle activity as cleared by your surgeon can help get you feeling back to your normal self."
How long to wait to see a doctor for a sprain?,"You raise a very important question.  What should you do about a simple ankle sprain?  First of all you did all the right things so far with the ice, elevation and keeping it wrapped.  We know that sprained ankles tend to heal on their own, but sometimes the pain associated with them is persistent.  Also, having one sprain can predispose you to getting others.  It is for these reasons that I always send my patients with newly sprained ankles to physical therapy (PT).  PT gives people the best chance for a full recovery.  Depending on the severity of your sprain you may also benefit from a walking boot for a short time.  Pain control with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also recommended (if you don't have stomach problems or kidney problems).  

I think it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment with an orthopedist regardless of how your ankle feels.  This is because even if the orthopedist doesn't have any surgical option, you can get a referral to a physical therapy.  This usually just requires a physician prescription with most insurances.  This way you can be sure to do everything to prevent this from happening again, and prevent any persistent pain.  "
How does nucleoplasty work and is it safe?,"A herniated disc can be quite painful.  They occur when the center of the intervertebral disc (made of cartilage) bulges outward and puts pressure on one of the spinal nerves coming out of the spinal column.  It usually causes back pain which radiates down a leg.  For most people, the herniated disc gets better on its own and no surgery is every required.  

A nucleoplasty is a surgical technique where the center part of the intervertebral disc (called the nucleus pulposus) is electrically ablated preventing it from bulging out an causing back pain.  It is often done with a needle that is inserted into the center of the intervertebral disc.  It is one of many possible surgical techniques which are reserved for people who fail the more conservative treatment of physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a> that will treating your herniated disc.  If your physical exam is inconclusive, then you may require an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> to tell for sure.  After that, you will benefit from a referral to physical therapy.  If this fails and you don't get better after a few months, then you can consult with an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> who performs procedures like the nucleoplasty.  "
Can one have tendonitis around their pelvis?,"Pain in the pelvic region is a common reason for people to seek medical advise, and sometimes it does require medical treatment. The doctors who will be well qualified to discuss this with you include your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care </a><a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> if you think it is exercise related.  The most common type of tendonitis that is found in the pelvic region is tendonitis of some of the hip muscles. Many of the hip muscles originate within the pelvis, which can lead to referral of the pain to that region. Two common forms include adductor tendonitis and ileopsoas tendonitis. These injuries are much more common in athletes and others who exercise regularly but can occur in anyone.   Other causes of musculoskeletal pain in this region include hip arthritis, which is common in middle aged to older adults and usually manifests as aching pain with exercise (even just walking) that is worse after activity.   Similarly, inflammation of the joint between the spine and the pelvis, called the sacroiliac joint, is very common.   As always the diagnosis and the management of your particular concern will require a physical examination by your personal physician. Setting up an office visit with your primary care doctor is highly recommended. "
Does eating help muscles heal?,"A muscle tear is a common condition in young healthy people who undergo physical activity. There are some instances where the muscle will not heal without medical intervention. As such, I encourage you to talk to your primary <a href=""/physical-therapists"">doctor</a> for a complete evaluation.

Muscles, as you are aware, are made of various basic elements. Protein is an integral component. This is the reason ""protein powders"" and other muscle building concoctions are advertised. Therefore, a diet with sufficient protein would be required to allow for muscle growth or healing. There is no evidence that extreme amounts of protein would be helpful, but we do know that deficiency is detrimental. Therefore having a minimum amount of protein (~ 1.5-2 g / kg of body weight) is recommended. Keep in mind to much protein can be harmful but a sufficient amount is required.

Anabolism (or building up of tissue) requires a significant amount of energy. Therefore a diet with sufficient energy is required. The make up of the diet, like in any condition, should come from a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals.

Note that physical activity can also be helpful in helping muscles heal. 

I encourage you to talk to your doctor. He or she maybe able to put you in touch with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> or <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapists</a> who could further help."
How does one treat a pulled neck muscle?,"""Pulling a muscle"" is a very common condition, something which we all have experienced. If symptoms persist after a normal recovery period (approximately 2 weeks or so) or if other worrying symptoms develop (such as weakness, <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> or tingling) you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to have it further evaluated. Muscles around the neck are of even more concern, as they support the spine.

""Pulling a muscle"" often falls onto the spectrum of muscle sprain or strain. A sprain is a stretch or tear of the ligament that connects muscle to the bones. A strain is a stretch or tear of the muscle itself. It is often hard to distinguish the two. The major problem that occurs with a sprain or strain is inflammation in the area which causes pain while the muscle/ligament heals. Therefore treatments to alleviate the pain often involved reducing inflammation.

The most common recommendation for any sprain/strain is to follow the RICE protocol, which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. For the neck, elevation and compression are often difficult, but rest and ice can be important (especially in the first 48 hrs). If symptoms persist, you can talk to your doctor about getting a soft neck brace to further help rest the neck muscles. The other major component is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor if your stomach and kidneys are healthy enough for these medicines. He or she may also prescribe physical therapy in order to help strengthen those muscles.

While this problem should resolve if it is a sprain/strain, it is important to talk to your doctor if you are worried. Bone injuries or nerve injuries can also occur after neck trauma and may not heal up without other intervention.

Why does my penis head have red spots all over it after intercourse?,"Glad to hear that you are using safe sex practices with your partner. I am sorry to hear that you have this current issue however. There are a number of different things that could be causing your problem. If the timeline of your brief history is true, then it sounds like the red spots only showed up after switching from one condom brand to another, and they were never there prior to switching. This makes me think that you are probably having a reaction to something in the new condoms. It could be something that the condoms are made out of (like latex), or it could be an additive to the condoms (like a spermacide). Also, it would be important to find out if you added anything else new such as a lubricant (like KY) or a stimulant (like a warming gel). My best guess from what you have described is that there is some type of contact dermatitis (irritation from contact with the skin) from something in the new condom. However, there are a number of sexually transmitted diseases that can cause a rash (red spots) and so to be safe I would probably get checked out if the spots don't go away in a few days. I wouldn't use the new condoms anymore since it might be a reaction to the material, but would go back to the old brand. Furthermore, I would talk to your partner about what happened, and make sure that they aren't having problems as well. If you have a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>, that would be the best place to go, otherwise go to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> first. Best of luck and sorry you're going through this.  "
Why do I have testicular pain?,"This sounds rather uncomfortable and certainly like something that should be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible.  There are many different causes of testicular pain and differentiating between them requires a thorough history, physical exam and potentially imaging studies (namely an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the scrotum) so seeing a doctor for an office visit is very important.  That being said, I have listed several common causes of testicular pain which I hope you find informative.
1) Epidymitis: this is inflammation in the anatomic area of the testicle responsible for sperm storage and maturation.  Normally it would be unilateral (affecting only one testicle) and can be due to infection (sexually transmitted disease as well as other bacterial infections).  The teste would be very tender to touch and may also be swollen.
2) Varicocele: this is essentially a 'varicose vein' in your scrotum, normally worse with straining and associated with a 'bag of worms' type swelling.  It can usually be managed with support briefs, but may require surgical intervention.
3) Testicular cancer: although not commonly associated with testicular pain, rapidly growing testicular cancer is one of the most worrisome potential causes for sub-acute testicular pain.  You would likely be able to feel a mass on one of the testes and this should be further evaluated with an ultrasound.

As you can see, there can be several serious causes of testicular pain and these symptoms warrant a visit to your primary care doctor right away!  I hope you are feeling better soon."
Cyst or cancer?,"You've definitely done all the right things up to now, such as examining the lump that you found multiple times to make sure that it is not growing in size or changing in any way, as those would be more concerning for cancer of the testicle. Also, cancer of the testicle is usually palpated as a firm nodule within the testicle itself, not outside the testicle, as seems to be in your case. 

There are numerous conditions that could cause a small lump like this that is mobile and outside of the testicle. One of these is definitely an epididymal cyst, which would be a benign condition. Also, a small varicocele, which is an enlargement of the veins that surround the spermatic cord within the scrotum, also a benign condition. 

I'd recommend continued followup with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to keep an eye on the lump over time to make sure that there is no concern that it is growing or changing. If there is any concern at all for cancer, they will be able to order an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the testicle, which is the first test that is usually used to rule this out. Book an appointment today!"
Why would a young man experience urinary incontinence?,"Since you haven't talked with any physician about this problem yet, you can probably start with just your regular <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. They can perform the initial evaluation and help determine if you need any additional workup or referral to a specialist, such as a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>. 

Urinary incontinence in a young man is very unusual, in the absence of complicating or prior medical problems. Examples of medical problems which might explain and lead to urinary incontinence include things like a history of trauma to the spine or spinal bifida. For these reasons, make sure to mention to your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> any relevant past medical history. Also make sure to mention if you have any other concerning symptoms such as trouble emptying your bowels or numbness or weakness in your legs or groin, as these are other symptoms that might indicate a serious problem with the spinal cord as the cause of your incontinence. 

In the absence of these red flags, it is likely that your doctor will want to start by ruling out sexually transmitted infections or urine infections with some basic lab tests. They'll also want to examine your genitals and prostate for any evidence of inflammation as a cause of the urinary leakage. Based on what they find, they'll be able to make recommendations for treatment. Book an appointment as soon as you can."
What can cause painful testicles?,"One emergent cause of pain in the testicles is something called testicular torsion. This is a condition in which one of the testicles becomes ""twisted"" on itself, cutting off blood flow. This is an emergency because it can lead to rapid and permanent damage to the testicle. The symptoms typically include severe, sudden onset of pain in one testicle. If you are experiencing these symptoms, then you need to go immediately to the emergency room for evaluation. 

On the other hand, if the pain is less acute and severe, then you can go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for an evaluation as soon as possible. The common causes of testicular pain include infection or inflammation of the tubules surrounding the testicle, called epididymitis. Also, a <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a> can cause an aching pain in the scrotum than can often feel like pain in the testicle. Finally, it is important to rule out the possibility of a tumor in the testicle, which can usually be done with either physical examination alone or physical examination as well as <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>. 

Start by booking an appointment at your earliest convenience. 

I hope this problem is solved for you quickly."
What can cause difficulty getting an erection?,"There are several things that can cause difficulty with getting an erection, no matter what age you are. It is important to speak with your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> to make sure that this is not a sign of a serious medical condition, and he or she may also be able to help you directly with your very frustrating problem. 
One of the first questions that your doctor will ask is often is whether or not you are able to have an erection in the morning. If you do still often awake with an erection or have one shortly after awakening, that is often an indicator that your body is able to have an erection, and that the problem may be something else instead. Regardless of what the cause is, there is a therapy that can help if you speak to the right people. If you are not able to have an erection in the morning, then this could be a sign of something concerning with regards to your blood vessels, and should be discussed with your doctor immediately. Decreased blood flow to your penis can be a sign of blood vessel disease throughout your body. Please speak to your doctor about your concerns. Book an appointment today."
What should I do if I have penile discharge and it is painful to ejaculate? Does this affect fertility? ,"These symptoms are definitely concerning and you should go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for an evaluation as soon as you possibly can. 

Given the pain with ejaculation and the discharge from the tip of your penis I would be most worried about ruling out a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea, as these are the infections that are most likely to cause these kinds of symptoms. Other symptoms might also include pain or burning with urination. 

There are simple laboratory tests for these sexually transmitted infections which are usually run on a urine sample and come back in a few days. If they are positive, your doctor will be able to give you the necessary antibiotic prescriptions to help clear up the infections. The antibiotics are effective, and there is not usually any lasting damage done. 

In the meantime, while waiting to see your doctor, you should avoid having unprotected sexual intercourse, because if this is a sexually transmitted infection it will be highly contagious and you might pass it on to your partner. 

Please make an appointment to see your primary care doctor right away, and I hope that you are feeling better very soon. "
What are kidney stones?,"This is an issue to discuss with your wife's <a href=""/urologists"">doctors</a>. Kidney stones are small masses that are made up of very small crystals. When the urine that is being filtered through the kidneys contains too much of a certain type of crystal, the crystals may start to join together and come out of solution, forming tiny stones. This process may take several weeks to months to fully occur. The most common type of kidney stone is made of calcium and oxalate; other types of stones include uric acid (the same type of crystal that causes gout), calcium phosphate, struvite, and cystine. 

While poor fluid intake and low urine output is generally considered a risk factor for developing kidney stones in general, each type of stone has different predisposing factors. For example, calcium oxalate stones are more common in people who have high blood calcium levels (such as from an overactive parathyroid gland), consume lots of high-oxalate foods (such as spinach) and those who have inflammatory bowel disease or have had intestinal surgery. 

As each type of stone is unique in terms of risk factors and treatment, it is important for your wife to find out which type of stone she has formed. This can be done by straining her urine (if she does not need surgery to remove her stone) or ensuring that her doctor sends any specimen collected by a procedure to the lab for analysis. You and your wife should then be able to talk with her <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> or <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a> about the best ways of preventing further stone formation."
What is chronic prostatitis?,"This is a discussion your husband should have with his <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a>. Chronic prostatitis simply means that the prostate gland continues to be inflamed, usually for more than 3-6 months, even after treatment for any acute infections and the elimination of other potential triggers. This condition is usually managed either by a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> or by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. 

Treatment of chronic prostatitis is usually aimed at suppressing any low-level infection that might still be present in the prostate gland as well as suppressing inflammation and continued tissue growth within the prostate. This is usually accomplished by a combination of medications to suppress prostate inflammation (such as a class of medications called alpha blockers) and antibiotics. Usually these medications will be trialed for at least a month or two to see if they are effective. 

For more chronic cases that do not respond to these treatments, it may also be necessary to add long-term medications to help with the nerve-mediated pain associated with the condition. 

Most people with chronic prostatitis will respond fairly well to these treatments, although there can definitely be very long-term low level symptoms, such as pelvic pain or burning with urination. Again, your husband should discuss treatment plans in greater detail with his doctor."
What are the options on solving prostate problems?,"I would recommend starting with a trip to either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> for an evaluation. They will be able to help you figure out what exactly the problem with your prostate gland is and what needs to be done about it. 

The fact that you have pain with urination suggests that you may have prostatitis, which is an inflammation of the prostate gland. Symptoms do often include pain with urination, as well as pelvic discomfort or trouble with sex. Prostatitis can usually be diagnosed with just a physical examination, which typically includes a rectal examination to allow the size and inflammation of the prostate to be more directly measured. Typically, the first step in treatment for prostatitis is to take anti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or naproxen around the clock. Additionally, if there is evidence of infection in the prostate, your doctor may want to prescribe a course of antibiotics. 

The other major prostate issue that could be occurring is benign prostatic hypertrophy, which causes symptoms such as incomplete emptying of the bladder and weak urine stream. However, unless there is a secondary infection of the urine, pain with urination is less common. This condition is often treated with medications to help open up the prostate gland and relieve the obstruction.

Why do I have blood in my semen?,"This is something that should be evaluated by your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a>, as it could be a sign of an infection of your prostate or something else that is going on in your genitourinary tract. It could also be a sign of a change in your diet that is causing your semen to appear like it is a different color. Of course the most concerning possibility is that this may be caused by cancer. If that doesn't convince you to see a doctor, I'm not sure what will! Blood in the semen may indicate some trauma, such as a recent <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> or <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, to the area. If you do not have any of these that you can recall, your doctor may be able to provide further suggestions as to what might have caused it just by speaking with you and asking you a few more questions about the timeline of when this started and if it is becoming more noticeable. Also, associated symptoms would be of interest and may point your doctor in the right direction to be able to help you with the right tests or studies. Please speak with your doctor to make sure there is not something serious."
How can I ensure that what I bough is actually Silagra? ,"This is something you should definitely discuss with your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a>. Buying any medication (or anything for that matter!) requires a large amount of trust between the buyer and the seller. The buyer trusts that your credit card will go through, and you trust that what you are buying will actually be the medication. What you are even more specifically hoping is that the medication, whatever it may be, will work to help you without untoward side effects. While buying from a reputable source which prescribes to appropriate guidelines within the industry is always the best bet, there is no way to know that a medication will work for you until you have actually tried it. All of this being said, however, a licensed pharmacy in the United States, online or a brick and mortar store, are closely regulated by the US FDA. There are regular tests of the products that are being manufactured and sold. As you also suggest, going online to compare the picture of what the pill should look like to what it does look like can provide an added measure of comfort. It is not recommended to purchase medications without having a prescription from your doctor, and there is some additional safety in having a pharmacist that you can work with. If you have purchased your medication from an unlicensed source or have any questions, please speak to your doctor and pharmacist."
Diarrhea and stomach pain after sex?,"It sounds like there are two separate issues here. First, there is the issue that your girlfriend has had several episodes of symptoms such as fever, <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, and <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a>. This may or may not be related to your own concerns, and it would be best for her to see her own <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible for help figuring out what is going on with her. 

Second, there is the issue of your symptoms, which seem to include a continued burning sensation inside the penis that comes and goes. In this setting, you are right to worry about a sexually transmitted infection. The tests for these infections are good, so if your doctor has performed them and they are negative, you should be ok, unless you have had new sexual contacts or exposures. 

Nevertheless, it does sound like you need to set up a visit with your primary care doctor to talk about your symptoms again and try to figure out what is going on. You may have a chronic inflammation inside the urethra or epididymis causing the burning sensation. This could be caused by a chronic infection, or it might be the result of mechanical strain (for example, if you are having frequent sex or masturbating frequently). Your doctor can help you figure out what to do. "
Is there any other way to treat bladder stones?,"Typically a stone in the urinary system or bladder will be calcified. Therefore, it will show up as a bright white spot on an x-ray. Fecal material, on the other hand, is not calcified, and will therefore typically not be as bright on an x-ray. It is usually fairly easy for a <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> to tell the difference between these two things. 

It sounds like you might be having trouble with stones in the urinary tract. This is an issue you should definitely talk to your doctor about, either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>. Sometimes stones are found in the bladder because they have just passed down from the kidney. Usually, these are small enough that they will eventually be urinated out of the body. However, sometimes large stones can collect in the bladder, or may even form there due to chronic inflammation or bladder infections. In these cases, it may sometimes be necessary to break up and retrieve the stones mechanically, a procedure that would typically be performed by a urologist. 

Start by making an appointment to see your doctor and discuss this issue with them. They can give you advice about whether this is an issue that needs treatment now."
I don't get a full erection - why?,"This is definitely a problem that you should talk with your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> about. Most of the time, trouble with sexual function is treated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, although some cases may be referred to a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> as needed. Start by seeing your primary care doctor, though!

There are many different things that could cause trouble achieve a firm or sustained erection. Your doctor will want to take a full medical history and perform a complete examination. 

By far the most common cause of erectile dysfunction is stress or fatigue or other psychological factors. However, prior to attributing the problem to these factors, it is important to rule out another medical cause. 

For example, there are several medical diseases that are very commonly associated with erectile dysfunction. These include diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and various hormone deficiencies. 

Furthermore, several common prescription medications may cause erectile dysfunction, including medications that are used to treat high blood pressure and depression. 

After your first visit, your primary care doctor will determine whether you need additional testing, such as blood tests, to look for any of these different causes. They can also help  you determine whether the erectile dysfunction is significant enough that it should be treated. "
Can you still have sex with a removed prostate?,"First of all, it is important to determine what kind of symptoms or diagnosis you have, and what kind of procedure is being proposed. 

If you are suffering from general prostate enlargement, or benign prostatic hypertrophy, then the usual procedure is not complete removal of the prostate but, rather, a procedure in which the inner portion of the prostate is ""trimmed"" away, allowing the urine to pass more freely. This procedure is called a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Complete removal of the prostate (prostatectomy) is not used for benign prostatic hypertrophy, but it may be necessary in some cases of <a href=""/procedure/prostate-cancer-1254"">prostate cancer</a>. 

Unfortunately, both the TURP procedure and the prostatectomy have <a href=""/procedure/sexual-dysfunction-painful-sex-dyspareunia-132"">sexual dysfunction</a> after the procedure as a common complication. In the case of the TURP procedure, a large proportion of men will have trouble ejaculating, although most will still be able to achieve an erection. With the prostatectomy, the rates of sexual dysfunction are even higher than with a TURP procedure. 

Because of the complications associated with these procedures, it is important to talk carefully with your <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> prior to electing to have a procedure. They will be able to help you determine if a procedure is the right choice for you. "
What are some the ways to treat prostate cancer?,"The treatment of <a href=""/procedure/prostate-cancer-1254"">prostate cancer</a> depends on many factors.  Most people get diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early stage because of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing that is performed widely.  The treatment options for early stage prostate cancer can be tough to choose from.  The first thing to realize is that the cancer is unlikely to progress to an aggressive form any time soon.  Often it can take 10 years.  If your father were older, then perhaps the best thing to do would be to just let it go.  Since he is still young, then treatment may be the right option.  The two options he is likely to be offered include radical prostatectomy (removal by surgery) or external beam radiation (radiation therapy).  They both work equally well, but unfortunately, both contain significant possible side effects.  Both can cause urinary <a href=""/procedure/incontinence-1040"">incontinence</a> and impotence.  The surgery has many other possible complications and the radiation can cause bowel problems.  With this knowledge, some people choose the watchful waiting approach which includes blood tests every few months and a repeat biopsy every year with treatment only if the cancer shows signs of progressing.

The best physician for your father to see about this is a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>.  Make sure that he asks many questions regarding his prognosis over the next 10 years, and the side effects of any treatments offered.  "
Kidney stone and hemorrhoids - what is happening?,"I would definitely touch base with your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> again. Sometimes, with kidney stones, it can take quite a while for them to move out of the system. However, after so many weeks, I would have expected things to have taken their course. 

If you are still having symptoms, it is important to reevaluate to make sure there is not a stone that is too large to pass, which can happen sometimes. This is important to catch because, as you say, the pressure of the urine backing up behind the stone can sometimes damage the kidney. It is usually easy enough to tell if there is still a stone present with a combination of urine and blood tests and, perhaps, a repeat scan such as an ultrasound or CT scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. 

Also, given that you have burning pain with urination, I think it is important to reevaluate to see whether or not you have an ongoing urine infection that, potentially, is not being cleared up by the antibiotics you are taking. 

You should start by consulting the <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> that you are currently seeing. Depending on your symptoms, they may want input from a specialist, such as a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>. "
What are the alternatives to a radical cystectomy?,"It sounds like you have had excellent treatment so far for your condition. 

As you probably know, radical cystectomy (completely removing the bladder) gives the best chance of completely removing the tumor. However, it is a major surgery, obviously, and also has significant impact on quality of life afterwards. Therefore, in many cases, attempts are made to conserve the bladder. In your case, it sounds like you had a transurethral resection of the tumor, with complete removal an no evidence of metastatic disease. Furthermore, you had <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> to further prevent recurrence of the tumor. 

At this point, you will need very close followup with your <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> and <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctors</a>. They will give you advice on how frequently they will want to monitor for any recurrence of the tumor, as you will continue to be at risk of having the tumor come back. In fact, up to half of all people who have their tumors removed in the fashion you did may be at risk of recurrence, which underscores the need for close followup. 

I recommend setting up a visit with your cancer doctors to discuss your care so far and your plan of care going forward, as they know your situation better than anyone else. "
Why would a man bleed from his penis after ejaculation?,"There are several different potential causes for this problem, but you should definitely get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> for a more complete evaluation. 

The most likely cause is that you suffered some irritation to the urethra or to the prostate from the sexual intercourse. This is a relatively common complication, especially of vigorous intercourse, and it could be more likely to occur if intercourse has been relatively infrequent. If this is the case, then rest should be all that is needed to heal things up. 

There are other possibilities as well. For example, inflammation of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause both painful ejaculation as well as some blood at the tip of the penis. Similarly hypertrophy of the prostate, which can begin to present itself in someone your age, might also be the cause. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a complete examination, include a rectal examination to see if the prostate is swollen, tender, or if it has any nodules that might require further investigation. Based on what they find, your doctor may recommend either a watch and wait approach or they might want to get some additional tests right away. 

Good luck!"
Is 'watch and wait' preferable for a small inguinal hernia?,"Inguinal hernias, as you probably know, are a very common type of condition that develops when a weakness or defect of tissue in the groin area allows stomach contents, such as fat and intestines to bulge downward, usually right into or alongside the scrotum. 

With very small inguinal hernias, a watch and wait approach is sometimes just fine, especially if the <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a> is not causing any symptoms, such as pain with walking or straining, and is not growing any larger. However, based on what you are describing as the size of your hernia, which is almost 8 by 7 centimeters, that doesn't sound like a small inguinal hernia to me! The problem with hernias this size is that they almost always keep getting bigger. Also, there is always the risk that they will 'strangulate' - meaning that the bulging tissue will be caught and no longer easily pushed back inside, potentially leading to death of that tissue. 

For these reasons, I would suggest that you talk to a general <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> about a potential surgical hernia repair. This is a generally a straight forward same day procedure and, in the absence of other major medical problems, is usually very well tolerated. "
What causes discolored semen?,"I am glad to hear that other than the change in the color of your semen you otherwise are feeling well. However, I would still suggest that you make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss this issue, especially if the discoloration persists. 

Some variation in the color and consistency of the semen can be normal, especially as we age. However, since this is a new change for you, it needs to be evaluated. 

In particular, there are a few medical conditions that can change the color of the semen. One of these is a prostate infection, which tends to give the semen a darker yellowish color. Other symptoms of a prostate infection might include burning or discomfort with urination or with sexual activity. The other is blood in the semen, which could be caused by a number of things irritating the prostate, once again including infection but also, occasionally, a sign of a tumor in the prostate. 

Your primary care doctor will be able to perform a complete examination, including looking for any swelling, tenderness, or lumps inside the prostate that might require further testing. If there is any evidence of infection, that should be treatable with standard antibiotics. Please see your doctor soon."
If someone has prostate cancer can they get an STD?,"Yes. The prostate is a gland that is often prone to developing cancer and become enlarged in many men as they age. For a multitude of reasons, it can be very problematic in the golden years especially. One type of treatment for <a href=""/procedure/prostate-cancer-1254"">prostate cancer</a> includes removal of the entire gland, which is recommended based on the grade and stage of your cancer. If you have had your prostate removed, you are still able to get a sexually transmitted infection, however. Removal will in no way affect your body's ability to resist these infections, and you are at the same risk as anyone else. For this reason, it is always important to exercise caution and practice safe sex practices. Hopefully you will inform your partner or partners as well so that they do not believe that the removal of your prostate will lead to any decreased risk. Not only can you contract an STD, you are also just as able to pass along STDs to your partners. While these are good rules to remember, please remember to speak to your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> about the specifics of your particular case and what you can do in the face of new symptoms or concerns. "
Do I have blood in my urine?,"<a href=""/procedure/blood-in-urine-hematuria-1003"">Hematuria</a> (blood in the urine) can be either gross (plainly visible to the naked eye) or microscopic (which, obviously, requires further testing in order to be noted). Your type is apparently not readily noted on visualization, but is apparent on lab testing. This can indicate many things, but what is most important is that you need to speak with a <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> about your test results so that you can get the proper treatment, if any is needed. Trauma can often be a cause of some blood in the urine, with recent catheterization of the bladder being one common source. Various kidney problems can also present with blood in the urine. There are additionally some disorders of the blood that can first be manifested as blood in the urine. Finally, some cancers will present in this way. Given that there are so many possible sources, most of which need further treatment, it is necessary for you to speak with your doctor more about your condition to determine which applies to you. Please speak to your doctor to determine which further tests, possibly including some sort of radiologic imaging, are needed in order to diagnose your problem and begin the appropriate treatment."
What happens if I have a cyst on my testicle?,"First of all, I think it is important to be reassured that a cyst on the testicle is not the same thing as testicular cancer, and, if this is indeed a cyst, then there should be no risk that it will turn into cancer. 

Cysts on the testicles are relatively common. One of the most common types is something called an epididymal cyst, which arise from the tissue that leaves the testicle and carries the sperm out of the body. These cysts generally do not have any particular cause, although they can occur more often in certain medical conditions, such as <a href=""/procedure/cystic-fibrosis-216"">cystic fibrosis</a>. Generally, they do not need to be treated, unless they become very large or become very painful. 

Another condition, not quite a cyst but also very common in this area, is something called a hydrocele, which is a collection of clear fluid in the pouch surrounding the testicle. Again, this is not usually a serious problem and only needs to be fixed if it is large and uncomfortable. 

Both an epididymal cyst and a hydrocele are fixed with a simple <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>. This surgery is performed by a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>, so you should make an appointment with a urologist soon. Good luck!"
Does prostatitis ever go away?,"Prostatitis, as your <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> no doubt told you, is caused by inflammation or infection in the prostate gland, and it leads to the types of symptoms that you are experiencing. 

There are actually two different types of prostatitis, and the answer to your question depends on which type you have. The most common type of prostatitis is infectious prostatitis, caused by a bacterial infection in the prostate gland. Infectious prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; because infections clear very slowly out of the prostate gland, it is usually necessary to treat for a long time with the antibiotics, usually around 4-6 weeks in total. However, most people start to feel better within a week or so of starting the antibiotics and, if they can tolerate the antibiotics every day for the full 4 to 6 week course, then complete resolution of the problem is likely. 

There is also a noninfectious form of prostatitis, which caused chronic, persistent pain and urinary discomfort. Unfortunately, noninfectious prostatitis doesn't have a definitive cure, and treatment is aimed at controlled the symptoms. Although there are medications that can help, the condition is unlikely to go away entirely. 

Talk to your urologist for more information about what exactly is going on in your case. "
Can erectile dysfunction affect men of all ages?,"<a href=""/procedure/erectile-dysfunction-impotence-male-sexual-dysfunction-1256"">Erectile dysfunction</a> is a very common problem in men. Although it is by far most common in older men, it can also occur in younger men as well. 

There are several different causes of erectile dysfunction, and therefore you should definitely make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss this issue as soon as possible. 

In younger men, the most common causes of erectile dysfunction are related to stress, fatigue, or emotional problems. Usually, if the underlying cause can be identified and corrected, the problem will resolve quickly. Medications are another common cause of erectile dysfunction, especially if you have recently started a new medication and are just now noticing this problem. 

There are also several more serious medical problems that are associated with erectile dysfunction. These tend to occur in older men, but conditions like diabetes can also occur in younger men. The best way to make sure that you do not have any medical problem underlying your erectile dysfunction is to have a complete checkup with your primary care doctor. If they suspect anything, they may want to order basic lab tests to complete the workup. 

Make an appointment with your doctor at your earliest possible convenience!"
What is wrong with my testicle?,"I highly recommend that you have this part of your testicle that is concerning to you examined by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to determine whether this is just a normal part of your anatomy or whether it is something that needs to be worried about. 

Most of the time, when someone feels a lump near their testicle, this ends up being a benign part of the anatomy in the scrotum. For example, many times what the person is feeling is the epididymis, which is the tube that comes off the back of the testicle and carries the sperm into the urethra. Also, you may feel the spermatic cord, which contains the blood vessels that feed the testicle. 

However, occasionally, a lump in a testicle can be an early sign of testicular cancer, especially if one testicle seems different than the other. Your doctor will be able to examine your testicles closely. If there is any concern at all that this lump might represent testicular cancer, they will likely want to perform an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the testicle, which can often help clarify what is going on and help determine whether a <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> of the lump is needed. 

Get in to see your doctor as soon as possible!"
What is this small bump on my testicle?,"I am sorry to hear about this, and I am sure that it is a cause of great stress to you right now. I would suggest that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. They will be able to take a look at the bump that you have found and help determine whether this is something that you need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about. 

Obviously, whenever a bump is found on the testicle the first priority is to make sure that it is not testicular cancer, which is a common form of cancer in men. Testicular cancer usually feels like a hard lump within or on the side of the testicle, given it an asymmetric feeling. 

One common thing that happens is that someone feels the epididymis, which is a structure of tubes common off the back of the testicle that can sometimes be confused with an actual lump in the testicle. The epididymis tends to be softer and more mobile than a true lump in the testicle would be. 

Your doctor will be able to determine whether this is just the epididymis you are feeling or whether it is a true lump in the testicle. If it is a true lump, then they will set you up with additional testing to rule out the possibility of cancer. "
Why do I keep getting cystitis?,"Cystitis is a medical term used to describe a urinary tract infection.  They are common in women, but in most cases are easily treatable with antibiotics and don't recur very often.  It seems that your infections are returning which is unfortunate.  Many times we are unable to find a problem with the urinary system or immune system when someone has recurrent cystitis.  Other times a correctable problem is found and the infections can be stopped.  The hope is that whatever the case is with you that it gets figured out and corrected if possible.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>.  The reason I think that you need to see a specialist in this situation is that you have recurrent cystitis that has not responded to your doctor's recommendations.  A urologist will be able to examine your urinary tract system with instruments such as a scope that can look at the inside of the bladder.  There may be fixable reasons (i.e. unknown <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a>) that may be helpful in preventing future infections.  It is possible that you will need to take low dose antibiotics for life to prevent these infections from returning.  Finally, other urinary tract conditions other than cystitis that can cause cystitis-like symptoms can be looked into.  "
Why is my testicle sore?,"There are a number of possibilities for the cause of testicular pain including infection.  Given your question concerning whether this could be sexually transmitted I’ll assume for the purpose of discussion that you are sexually active.  Perhaps, one of the most common causes of testicular pain related to infection is caused by infection of a portion of the testicle called the epididymis.  This is a small tubular structure that sits on top of the testicle and aids in the maturation of sperm.  Infection of the epididymis can sometimes cause swelling and fevers, but almost always causes a degree of pain.  Chlamydia or gonorrhea are two of the most common causes of this type of infection in sexually active young men, but other bacteria including many not sexually transmitted can also cause infection.  There are non-infectious causes of inflammation and pain of this epididymis, as well, which can be related to trauma, bicycle riding or other activities.

Perhaps, one of the other serious causes of testicular pain is torsion or twisting of the blood supply to the testes.  This causes the blood supply to be cut off and results in a great deal of pain.  The onset of these symptoms is usually quite rapid.  You can also, have torsion of a small part of the testicle called the appendix testis, which tends to be less painful and is usually less dangerous.  Finally, other problems such as hernias, skin infections, or autoimmune disease can cause a painful scrotum.  You should contact your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> who can discuss this more thoroughly and help direct you to the appropriate therapy.  Good luck!
"
Is my penis infected?,"There are many causes of penile pain and swelling, which include infection, autoimmune diseases, and allergies among others.  Different disorders are more likely to affect different parts of the penis.  Balantitis refers to inflammation of the glans (head) penis.  It can also involve the foreskin in uncircumcised males and then is termed balanoposthitis.  It frequently results in pain and swelling of this part of the penis, in addition to redness, rash, and occasionally discharge.  Pain with urination (dysuria) can result from urinary tract or sexually transmitted infections.  Infection of the skin and soft tissues around the penis and scrotum can result from a particularly dangerous condition called Fournier’s gangrene.  Patients with this condition can be quite ill, and have a great deal of pain, which does not sound like your particular issue.

Other common causes of penile inflammation include <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, allergic reaction, reaction to an irritant such as a particular soap or detergent, or other skin conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis, <a href=""/procedure/psoriasis-87"">psoriasis</a>, fungal infections, and some sexually transmitted infections.   Given the wide variety of causes of penile inflammation, the most important thing you can do is see your primary care provider who will examine you and determine whether this is a common infection, allergy or something more serious.  Good luck!
"
Why does it hurt when I have an erection?,"You should definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this as soon as possible!

First of all, most of the time when the penis hurts with an erection, this is due to strain or overuse. For example, if you have recently been having a lot of vigorous sexual intercourse, or if you have been masturbating more than usual, this is the most likely explanation for the pain, and, if so, things tend to get better over a few days with some rest. 

However, the fact that you also think the penis might be bent to one side is more concerning, as this suggests the possibility of a condition known as Peyronie's disease. This is a condition in which an area of scar tissue forms on the side of the penis, gradually causing the penis to bend to one side and causing pain with erection that can be severe at times. 

Peyronie's disease needs to be diagnosed early, because if it is not treated, it can lead to serious <a href=""/procedure/sexual-dysfunction-painful-sex-dyspareunia-132"">sexual dysfunction</a>. If your primary care doctor things that your examination is consistent with Peyronie's disease, they will make a referral to a urologic specialist for more evaluation and treatment. "
What causes an enlarged prostate?,"An enlarged prostate is a very common development as men age.  In some cases a large prostate can be associated with prostate cancer (why <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physicians</a> discuss <a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">cancer screening</a> with older patients), but a condition called benign prostate hypertrophy is by far the most common reason for prostatic enlargement. As the name implies, BPH is NOT cancer and simply refers to the changes that are a very common part of the aging process.  In addition to aging or cancer, chronic infection or inflammation can also lead to an enlarged prostate.  Infection is something that can occur in younger men, but it is typically associated with symptoms (painful urination, more <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a> etc).

With regard to screening for an enlarged prostate, there is no need to start anything now.  The symptoms of a large prostate include difficulty starting to urinate, increased frequency of urination, waking up at night to urinate, or a weak urinary stream. If you notice any symptoms like that, you should definitely bring them up with your physician.  There are medications (which your father may have started) that can help shrink the prostate to help control symptoms. However, in the absence of symptoms, there is no reason for a young man to be screened for prostate concerns.

It sounds like you are concerned about your family history as it relates to your own health.  The best thing to do with any health concern is to see your primary care physician to discuss in more detail. He or she can talk more about your person health as it relates to your family history, prior medical issues, and physical exam."
Is there any way to get rid of kidney stones once you have them?,"<a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">Kidney stones</a> are small hard formations of calcium and other materials that are excreted by the kidney.  They are very common, and only cause serious problems when they get stuck in the ureter and obstruct the flow of urine from your kidneys to your bladder.  If you have kidney stones, there is always that possibility that this will happen.  However, the process of actively getting rid of them is challenging, and usually not done unless there is an event where a kidney stone gets stuck in the ureter.  

The best physician for you to see about this problem is a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>.  A urologist has the tools available to get rid of the kidney stones if necessary.  You can also get some good advice on how to prevent new kidney stones from forming and prevent the ones you have from getting bigger.  Depending on the type of kidney stone you have, there are medications that can be used to help prevent their formation.  For example, a medication called hydrochlorothiazide helps prevent calcium excretion, which is an important part of the process by which some kidney stones form.  Finally, you can get advice as to how much fluid you should drink everyday.  In some instances, drinking more fluid can help prevent kidney stone formation.  Good luck.  "
Is something wrong with my bladder?,"It really depends on a few key facts. If you were a female with symptoms of urgency, it could suggest a bladder infection. Often you may also experience some burning sensation along with frequent need to urinate as well. A bladder infection comes on more suddenly. It is much more common if you have had recent Foley catheter insertion. A woman in her ""honeymoon"" period can also have increased risk of a bladder infection.  However, if you were a male in his senior years and experienced symptoms of urgency with <a href=""/procedure/incontinence-1040"">incontinence</a>, it could mean that your prostate is enlarged. Often this comes on fairly gradually. Most men in their 70's will start to experience these symptoms which are entirely manageable by medication. On the other hand, it also indicates that your kidneys are failing which is a very serious issue. Not being able to urinate for longer than a few hours can result in bladder distention and prolonged blockage can also lead to kidney failure.  However, if your kidneys are already in the state of failure, you may not produce much urine at all, and the symptoms of needing to empty your bladder may be coming from the pressure in your abdomen exerting on the bladder. Your symptoms could potentially be quite serious so I would strongly suggest that you seek proper medical evaluation from an <a href=""/internists"">internist</a> or <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>."
Why am I having painful erections?,"Prolonged, painful erection is also known as priapism.  It can often last more than 4 hours and is not associated with sexual activity and not relieved by orgasm. An erection occurs because the blood flows into the penis and becomes flaccid when the blood is drained. Priapism occurs when the blood flows into the penis that is not drained adequately. It is not known why some babies, youngsters and more commonly men in their 20-50's get this condition, but it has been observed in patients with leukemia and sickle cell anemia as well as those using antidepressants, blood pressure medications, alcohol, cocaine and other illicit drugs.  Spinal cord injuries and injuries to the genitals as well as those who have had general anesthesia can increase the risk of getting priapism.  That said, it is very important to get it treated because prolonged erection can cause scarring in your penis, thus predisposing to further recurrences. Most often the blood can be drained in a <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a>'s office, which is adequate most of the time. The goal of the treatment is to preserve penile function, and rarely does it require surgery. There are medications to help to shrink the blood vessels that could be used. I think you would definitely benefit from a visit to your medical doctor or <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> who can better assess your condition and treat it appropriately. "
"If a male is sterile from a high temperature, can he become fertile again?","There are many factors which can contribute to male sterility, and if your friend is concerned about this issue, he should definitely have a full consultation with a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> or with a fertility expert. Many causes of <a href=""/procedure/male-infertility-1258"">male infertility</a> can be identified, and some of them are treatable. 

I do have some doubts that fever alone could permanently cause infertility. While it is true that high temperature decrease sperm viability, this association is weak. Furthermore, it would be unlikely that fever alone could permanently damage the ability of the testicle to produce sperm. 

There are some exceptions to this. For example certain viral infections, especially mumps, may cause high fevers and also at the same time swelling and inflammation in the testicles. Mumps is one of the leading infectious causes of infertility worldwide. 

It is also possible to have infertility from a serious medical illness, often due to the malnutrition that results or from shock of the illness to the pituitary gland, resulting in decreased amounts of sex hormones. Sometimes this damage may be permanent, if the episode of illness was severe enough to permanently damage the pituitary gland. 

Your friend should talk to his <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> for more advice on this issue. "
Why is my testicle so sore?,"Testicular pain is a common problem among young males. There are several reasons for why this could be happening to you. Depending on how long you have been having these symptoms and your age, there are may be different causes ranging from benign causes to more serious ones. Sudden pain in the testicle may be related to inflammation of structures within the testicles known as the epididymis, with inflammation known as epididymitis which can cause redness and swelling on the testing. Generally, this is related to an infection and can be treated with antibiotics. You may even have symptoms of a urinary tract infection. 
If you have a fever and are having intense pain, this maybe a sign of a serious infection that can cause gangrene, that may require surgical treatment. An emergent cause of testicular pain is twisting of the testicle causing no blood flow to the testicle that will also require surgery. Other conditions that can cause this maybe a <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a>, an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the testicle, varicocele. 
Testicular cancer is generally painless. However, you should make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to determine the cause of your symptoms and to undergo a good physical exam that can facilitate treatment for your condition. "
When should a man start getting his prostate checked?,"This is a very insightful question, as early cancer detection offers the best chance of cure.  Screening exams and a careful family history are the best way you and your <a href=""/urologists"">doctor</a> can go over your health risks and help determine when you should start being screening for particular types of malignancy.  

In general, it is recommended that men with an average risk of <a href=""/procedure/prostate-cancer-1254"">prostate cancer</a> start being screened with a digital rectal exam and PSA blood levels at age 50.  There is some evidence that African-American men should start being screened a decade earlier, at age 40.  For patients in whom cancer runs in the family, earlier screening may be indicated.  In your case, your doctor will want to go over who in your family has had cancer and what cancers they have had.  Prostate cancer is thought to be very common, and if the men in your family were diagnosed in their 70's and 80's, that is an entirely different situation than an early diagnosis in the 30's or 40's.  In addition, depending upon the pattern of what cancers run in your family, you may be referred to a genetic counselor for further testing.

The importance of early screening truly cannot be overemphasized, and you are doing exactly the right things to help protect your health down the road."
Is there a relationship between jaw pain and shoulder or upper back pain?,"It sounds like you have been having several concerning and bothersome symptoms recently, all of which you should discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  It is certainly possible that they are related, and hopefully you can get to the bottom of this soon.  The jaw pain that you describe could be related to a problem with the temporomandibular joint, ie TMJ.  This is a common problem that is exacerbated with opening one's mouth widely.  If you are someone who grinds his or her teeth at night, you may also be more susceptible to irritation of this joint.  The pain in your shoulder or upper back could also be due to several things.  You could have an intrinsic problem with the shoulder joint (rotator cuff, labrum) or a muscle strain around the scapula.  The connection between the shoulder and the clavicle can also be problematic, particularly if you've had any trauma to the area lately (can cause a shoulder separation).  Finally, it is also possible for pressure or impingement of the spinal nerves which can cause neck or back pain.  This seems more unlikely in your case because you are not experiencing any concurrent numbness or <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a>, but given your multiple new symptoms, the best thing to do would be to see your primary care physician right away for evaluation and possible referral to an orthopedic specialist and/or a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>."
Why do I have sharp pain in my wrist?,"I'm sorry to hear that you are having pain in your wrist! I would definitely recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this, as they will be able to examine your wrist and help you figure out what is going on. 

When you go to see them, make sure you let them know if you have had any recent injury to the wrist (such as falling and landing on your hand), as acute injury is one of the most common causes of <a href=""/procedure/wrist-pain-1091"">wrist pain</a>. Usually, this is just a sprain, which can be treated with rest, ice, and anti inflammatory medications. However, rarely, a wrist injury can lead to a broken bone, and your doctor will be able to figure out whether you need an <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> to rule this out. 

Another common cause of wrist pain is a repetitive use injury, such as might occur with certain jobs, like typing at a computer keyboard all day, as well as with some sports (for example, swinging a tennis racket frequently). Repetitive use injuries are typically treated in much the same fashion as a wrist sprain, although trying to avoid the activity that causes the pain is very important. 

Make an appointment with your primary care doctor!"
How do I know if my concussion is healing properly?,"If you have not seen your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> about this issue yet, you definitely should do so. As you probably know, a <a href=""/procedure/concussion-1462"">concussion</a> is a form of mild brain injury typically caused by blows to the head. The symptoms can be quite variable, but they often include the types of things you are experiencing, such as headache, trouble focusing on tasks, and feeling ""dazed.""

It can take concussion symptoms a while, sometimes several weeks or more, to resolve completely. This is why it is important to work with your doctor on this, because they will help more accurately gauge how quickly you are healing. Sometimes, concussion symptoms can persist for an even longer period of time and, in that case, it may be necessary to treat some of the symptoms with medications. 

At the same time, it is vital that you not return to contact sports until your doctor says it is ok for you to do so, which typically will not be until your symptoms are totally resolved. This is because the risk of a ""second concussion"" while suffering from a first concussion are not trivial and can cause very severe neurological symptoms. 

Talk with your doctor immediately. "
Why does my thumb hurt?,"I'm sorry to hear about this injury. Since you are continuing to have pain without relief, I would recommend seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> (or your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a>) to see if you've caused any serious damage or need any specific treatment. 

By far the most likely thing is that you've just had some serious bruising and soft tissue damage that is going to take a while to clear up. Sometimes it can take several weeks to get back to normal after an injury like this. However, I think it is also worth ruling out a fractured bone in the palm of the hand as well as a more serious ligament injury at the base of the thumb. Your doctor will be able to examine the area and determine if you need x-rays or any additional workup. 

In terms of treatment, they may recommend a brace for the thumb, rest, and anti inflammatory medications for a few weeks. On the other hand, if there is evidence of <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> or serious ligament injury, they will want to refer you to see an orthopedic hand specialist for further treatment. 

Please make an appointment as soon as you can!"
What can I do to minimize my knee pain?,"First of all, if you are having knee pain with exercise, this may be due to an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the knee, especially since you are mostly doing high impact exercises. As such, the most prudent thing to do would be to back off on the intensity of your exercise regimen until you can be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a>. They can help you pinpoint more accurately the location and cause of the knee pain and make recommendations about how to modify your exercise regimen to both allow healing to occur and also to prevent future injury. 

Two of the most common causes of knee pain in people who perform high impact exercise are the iliotibial band syndrome and patello femoral pain syndrome (""runner's knee""). Both of these conditions are essentially overuse conditions, and stretching exercises or exercises to strengthen certain muscle groups in the leg can be very helpful. 

Another common cause of knee pain in people doing these kinds of exercise is overpronation, where the foot rolls inwards with each stride. This can often be remedied by changing the type of arch support in the shoe you use. 

Start by seeing your doctor! "
"Can a bruise turn yellow first, then turn black and blue?","Bruises often go through a cycle of color changes, and you have described a classic pattern of first turning slightly yellow, followed by the typical conspicuous black and blue tones. While most patients remember some form of trauma associated with their bruising, some patients do not recollect an exact moment of their <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>. In these latter cases, some form of trauma may have actually occurred without the patient knowing. This is often the case in older individuals with more fragile skin, or those who take blood-thinning medications like aspirin or coumadin. In other cases, unprovoked or frequent bruising can be a sign of some derangement of a patient's clotting system, such as abnormal clotting proteins or a low number of platelet cells. 

I recommend that you seek out the help of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. Usually a reasonable explanation can be achieved with a thorough medical history and physical exam. In some cases, blood tests can be done to look at the clotting system and rule out any potentially dangerous underlying causes."
Why do my knees turn purple?,"The purple discoloration of your knees with exercise might not be related to the underlying pain. I say this because, when people exercise vigorously, sometimes the skin changes colors due to sweating and changes in blood flow and this should not in and of itself cause pain.

However, the persistent pain in your knees definitely needs a more complete evaluation. If you have already seen your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, it might be time to get an opinion from a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> or an orthopedic doctor. It is possible that your <a href=""/procedure/scoliosis-spine-deformation-1214"">scoliosis</a> and your knee pain are related, as postural problems from the scoliosis, if it is severe, may cause mechanical imbalance that puts excess pressure on your knees. However, since you are very physically active, it is also possible that there is something going on in your knees themselves. One common knee condition in your age group is something called Osgood Schlatter disease, although other conditions, including ""Runner's Knee,"" are also very common. A sports medicine or orthopedic doctor should be able to perform a thorough examination and help you figure out what is going on. They may prescribe physical therapy or specialized exercises to help you start feeling better! "
Random leg pain for over a year - what is it?,"I am very sorry to hear that this is such a persistent issue for you! You should certainly see a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">joint specialist</a> right away. And unfortunately, knee pain like yours is typically related to running and an active lifestyle.

To start with, it may be a good idea to avoid running or other high impact exercise until you can have the knee reevaluated by a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>. Continuing to run on an inflamed knee may only keep the symptoms going and could potentially result in permanent damage to the knee. I recommend seeing a doctor specialized in knee pain and knee problems, such as an orthopedic doctor or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a>. 

Runner's knee is still probably the most likely possibility. But I think it is important to rule out other causes, such as a Baker's cyst behind the knee, or damage directly to the knee meniscus or ligaments surrounding the knee. Based on what the orthopedic doctor or sports medicine doctor finds, they may recommend additional imaging of the knee (such as an MRI), as well as leg strengthening exercises, continued physical therapy, and avoidance of certain types of exercise. 

Good luck!"
Is there a vitamin that increases lung function?,"Lung capacity is something that can be difficult to improve with vitamins. While a healthy diet is an important part of optimizing your ability to perform at a high level, the actual amount of air that your lungs can inhale is mostly affected by the combination of your natural lung capacity and your conditioning status. For the most part, we are all born with a predisposed size and ability that our lungs will achieve. This can be altered based on our nutrition status as we grow, our exercise (or lack thereof), and how much weight we gain. Other factors, such as smoking and a history of <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>, can also affect how well our body does at taking in and using oxygen. There are many people that use different medications and substances to improve their performance, many of which are not necessarily legitimate and can have long term side effects. The best thing to do if you are trying to increase your ability and performance is to work with a strength and conditioning coach to make sure that you are doing everything that you can to be physically fit. Your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> can also help to make sure you are fully healthy. Please speak to your doctor. "
Is it normal for your toes to feel cold after you sprain your ankle?,"I would definitely recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this. I always recommend that any significant ankle sprain be checked out, mostly because it is important to make sure, from a medical perspective, that there are no broken bones or severely damaged ligaments. 

When the ankle swells up, it is common for there to be some coolness in the foot. You are right that, generally speaking, this tends to be the result of the swelling itself, and it tends to improve over time as the swelling goes down. However, with a severe ankle <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, it is possible to damage blood vessels or nerves running to the foot, and this can be a serious problem requiring immediate medical attention. Your doctor can examine the foot and make sure there is no evidence of this. 

Your doctor will be also able to determine if your ankle is badly enough sprained that you need <a href=""/procedure/wheelchair-crutches-1243"">crutches</a> or a brace. In the most severe cases, they may want to have you see a sports medicine or orthopedic specialist for follow up to make sure things are healing well. They can also give you a prescription for pain medication to help you stay comfortable. "
What is this ache in my leg?,"There are a few different causes of pain like this, and you will probably want to discuss the issue with a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> or with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> again. The doctor you saw already is no doubt right that there is nothing broken, but there are still a few different over use type injuries that can result from playing sports, and you probably have one of these. 

For example, there is a condition called iliotibial band syndrome, which is inflammation and tightness in the tissue running down the outside edge of the thigh towards the knee. This pain will often respond to a combination of stretching and strengthening exercises in the leg as well as anti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. 

Similarly, another condition, called patellofemoral pain syndrome, or ""runner's knee"", might cause symptoms of pain within and on the outside edge of the knee (although if the pain is more concentrated higher up the thigh, it is more likely to be iliotibial band syndrome). 

A sports medicine doctor should be able to examine your leg and help make a diagnosis. Make an appointment today!"
Did I injure my abdominal muscles doing push ups?,"Given the fact that there is an association directly in time between your push up routine and your sore abdominal muscles, I think it is likely that this is what caused your pain. Although we generally think of push ups as involving mostly the muscles of the arms and shoulders and chest, if you think about it one also tends to 'tense up' the abdominal muscles when performing push ups, and this is probably what you did. 

Generally, this <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the abdominal muscles is not serious. You should rest up and avoid any more vigorous exercise until the pain subsides. 

Also, I would recommend that you talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor and, potentially, an athletic trainer about how best to develop a work out routine. There is nothing wrong with push ups per se, and you should be able to continue to do them. However, the problem is when you do too many push ups too quickly. The same applies to any form of vigorous physical exercise. With your doctor's help, and with advice from your local gym or trainer, you can easily develop a safe, gradual exercise plan that avoids personal injury while still meeting your fitness goals. "
Why do my muscles get so tight after I exercise?,"The skeletal muscles are truly amazing organs of our body, which need to be understood to be able to explain your symptoms. Each muscle is made of millions of small fibers that ratchet up on top of each other when you contract them, and then relax when you relax. Each fiber or ratchet unit has an optimal length at which it attaches to the next fiber in order to generate strength. When those fibers are used, they obtain this optimal setting, which helps them to generate more force when they are called upon. That it, they are constantly in the ready position, which is why lifting weights regularly causes people to appear more muscular: their muscles are in a constant state of contraction to a small degree. Stretching is important for many reasons, and one of them is to help coordinate the muscle fibers and relax the stretch receptors that are triggered when there is too much tension on a muscle. This is extremely helpful at preventing injuries, and should be performed both before and after exercising in order to maintain optimal wellness. It is also important for your cartilage, as cartilage needs movement to buffer properly. Please speak to your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> and have your <a href=""/procedure/annual-physical-76"">annual physical</a> exam as suggested. "
Is my ankle broken?,"I would recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. There are several potential forms of injury that you could have sustained to the ankle. They can examine your ankle closely and help figure out what you need to do. 

Based on the mechanism of injury (being struck in the ankle with a ball), the most likely injury here is that you simple suffered from a contusion or <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> of the ankle. This would cause some pain and swelling, as you are describing. 

A more serious ankle injury would be a sprain. This involves stretching or damage to the ligaments in the ankle. It sounds like you probably don't have a sprain, as this typically does cause some pain with walking, which you do not have. However, you could have sustained a minor sprain. 

Finally, you have suffered a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>. Again, this seems unlikely given how minor your symptoms are. However, sometimes a small fracture might cause minimal symptoms. 

Your doctor can determine whether or not you need x-rays or additional workup. They can also give you some recommendations on which medications to take to reduce the pain and the inflammation in the ankle. "
Is this a sprained ankle?,"It is pretty unlikely that the pain in the middle of your leg is due to an ankle sprain. An ankle sprain by definition is damage to the ligaments in the ankle joint, and this means swelling and pain directly over and around the ankle and difficulty walking. 

With the kind of <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> you describe, I would be concerned to make sure that this is not a small fracture, such as a hairline fracture, of the leg bone. For this reason, I would strongly recommend that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or go see an emergency room doctor. They will be able to examine the leg and, if they are concerned about a potential bone fracture, they will be able to get an <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> to rule this out. 

If the x-ray turns out ok, then it is mostly likely that this is just a bruise or sprained muscle, and your doctor will be able to give you advice about how to take care of that, such as elevating the leg to reduce swelling, applying ice, and taking anti inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen. 

Good luck, and I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Why do I have pain on the tops of my shoulders?,"Pain in the distribution you are describing is most likely due to a musculoskeletal problem. Neck and shoulder pain are very commonly encountered problems in the primary care setting, and are most often due to a <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a>. These symptoms usually occur after a person has begun a new exercise or weight-lifting regimen, or struggled to lift something heavy in the preceding days. Supporting this diagnosis would be tenderness in these areas when you press on them or if the pain is worse with certain movements of the shoulders or neck. The muscles involved are likely the trapezius and deltoids. 

Fortunately, musculoskeletal pain is a benign condition and is often completely alleviated in a few weeks with conservative treatment. This involves avoidance of strenuous activities, ice/heat application, stretching the affected muscles, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen. 

If you have any concerns about your neck/shoulder pain or do not notice significant improvement in your symptoms within 1-2 weeks, then you should visit your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for further assessment. With a thorough history and physical exam, your doctor can help you come up with an accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment plan. "
Do I have jumper's knee?,"Jumper's knee is a very common type of knee injury that typically occurs in people that are vigorously active, particularly if the jump, bend, or twist at the knee frequently while exercising. The condition results primarily in pain in the tendon below the kneecap, as well as stiffness when bending the knee. Since the injury occurs from overuse, it typically is treated with rest and anti inflammatory medications; physical therapy and stretching exercises may also be needed. 

There are several other very common knee injuries that can also occur in physically active people. For example, patello femoral pain syndrome (runner's knee) is often confused with jumper's knee. However, the pain tends to be more diffuse in the knee, and there is more pain with climbing stairs or sitting. There is also often a ""creaking"" sensation when the kneecap moves. Although it is treated in much the same way as jumper's knee, the exercises that might be used to recuperate are slightly different. 

Also, it is important to rule out a serious ligament injury, such as a ligament tear, whenever sports that involve a lot of stopping and starting and twisting occurs.

Because there are several potential causes of your knee pain, you will need to go see a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> to figure out exactly what is going on. I suggest that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> as soon as possible.  "
Did I pull my hamstring?,"Sorry to hear about the <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>! Anytime you have any sort of injury while running, you really should not run again until the pain is gone completely. Otherwise you run the risk of a reinjury, which can be much worse and can interfere with your training for a long time. 

A strain is a type of muscle injury in which some muscle fibers tear as a result of over work during exercise. A strain and a pulled muscle are two names for exactly the same thing, and the symptoms include tenderness and tightness in the affected muscle. 

Treatment for a strained muscle can include rest, icing the affected area, and regularly taking over the counter anti inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen. If your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> prescribes these measures, you could be starting to feel better within several days to a week or so. 

Please make an appointment to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to examine your leg to make sure you have not sustained a more serious injury. "
Do I have synovitis?,"There are several possibilities here, however if this is the arm that you mostly use when you are playing sports and you have noticed an association between your physical activity and the development of the swelling and pain, then the most likely diagnosis is tendonitis.

Tendonitis in the elbow is very common and it is usually an over use <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, typically from vigorous physical activity. If the pain and swelling is most on the outside edge of the elbow, this is called <a href=""/procedure/tennis-elbow-1094"">tennis elbow</a>, or lateral epicondylitis. If the pain and swelling is mostly on the inside edge of the elbow, this is called golf elbow, or medial epicondylitis. Regardless, both types are treated the same, with rest, ice, and anti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or naproxen. 

Another common condition in the elbow is olecranon bursitis, which is an inflammation in the bursa, or fluid filled sac, that surrounds and cushions the elbow joint. 

I suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who will be able to help you determine which of these conditions you have. Based on this, they will also be able to give you some recommendations for appropriate treatment. "
Can you still have a bruise if there is no discoloration on your skin?,"It sounds like your accident is causing a significant amount of pain! Hopefully you will be feeling better soon.  Your question is a good one, and regardless of the specific words used it sounds like the incident with the pole is definitely the cause of your pain.  In a strict medical sense, the words <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> and contusion can be used interchangeably--they both refer to a blunt force <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to organs or tissues, including the skin or subcutaneous soft tissue (more often referred to as a bruise) or internal organs or muscles.  Muscle contusions are actually very common sports injuries, and when the muscle that is injured is deep, you may well develop pain and swelling without the visible color changes associated with disruption of blood vessels within the skin.

In general, muscle contusions will heal over time, but the affected area may be sore for a while.  To make sure that you haven't developed a more serious injury that would require further intervention, it is best to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> as soon as possible.  Depending upon your injury, physical therapy may actually be very helpful to assist with stretching exercises or therapeutic modalities including heat/ice or ultrasound to help aid healing."
Do you have to stretch before you exercise?,"Stretching routines performed during warm-up procedures may help you improve flexibility for a short time.  However, there is little evidence to prove that stretching reduces delayed-onset muscle soreness, prevents injuries or improves performance so it is not really possible to answer the question with absolute certainty.  With that said, I think it is fair to say that most people who stretch do feel better as a result of it.  It is important when exercise to tune in to your body and feel where the tension is to do at least some stretching.   Stretching may help you increase your range of motion.  It also increases blood flow to the muscle, which is greatly beneficial.  But, stretching incorrectly can do more harm than good.  Such harm is that stretching cold muscles may cause <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>.  For instance, you may hurt yourself if you don't warm up your muscles with some light walking or jogging for 5-10 minutes before stretching.   On the other hand, if you have a chronic condition or an injury, it may be necessary to adjust your stretching or else it may cause further harm.  In short, you don't have to stretch before your workout but, if you do, make sure to do it correctly.  I would suggest a consultation with a sport medicine specialist or <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> about the best way to stretch if you have any health concerns.  "
Did I pull or tear a leg muscle?,"It is possible that you have pulled a muscle or muscle group in your leg. If you run a lot on hard surfaces or up and down the hills, you are at higher risk for injuring your leg muscles. Muscle injuries often take days to weeks to heal properly. However, if you do not have time to rest up it may even take longer to heal. It is also common for runners to get hair-line fractures in the tibia, which are difficult to diagnose without proper imaging. If you hurt your leg 2 months ago and it still hurts, it is likely that you have sprained your ligaments or torn your tendons. Ligaments and tendons do not have good blood supply.  As a result, it takes them a lot longer to heal. However, if you are not able to put your exercise routine down, it may not ever heal properly. A proper way to treat musculoskeletal <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> is to rest, decrease tension, and make sure that you keep the injured part elevated when not ambulating. This will decrease swelling and inflammation and set up an environment for your body to heal itself.  In addition, you need proper nutrition, fluid intake, and avoiding tobacco use. Smoking decreases oxygenation in your tissue as well as narrowing the small blood vessels. That said, it appears to be a more involved injury and therefore should be evaluated properly by a medical professional like a sport medicine specialist. Good luck!"
What is the best way to treat a pulled muscle?,"It sounds like you may have a <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a>. A strain is an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the muscle or tendon due to overuse or overstretch. Generally, this is characterized by pain at the area of injury, and muscle stiffness. Although this can happen to anyone, athletes and sports players develop muscle strains due to overuse injury. 
The main mode of therapy early on during the injury is resting and abstaining from activities that have caused the strain to happen in the first place. In addition, ice application is useful as well. Ice will reduce the swelling at the site by compressing the blood vessels. Furthermore, it is also advised to apply a compression dressing ( for example an Ace Wrap) also to reduce swelling. And finally, elevating the strained area is also a good idea. While over the counter non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like Motrin may help with the pain, it is best to make an appointment with your primary <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> to have this examined so that you can treat it properly. Your doctor will be able to do a thorough exam after taking a history of your workout habits and provide guidance on how to avoid this in the future. "
How do I treat my pulled hamstring?,"This is a very common occurrence where sudden strenuous activity can cause <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a> very commonly in the hamstring. The level of injury can be graded depending on certain findings. Grade 1 injuries are characterized by soreness and intermittent pain. Grade 2 injuries are more severe with more severe pain. A Grade 3 injury is the most severe with stabbing pain and inability to walk without pain. The muscle maybe completely torn and a large lump maybe visible above the tear. There may even by significant bruising.
As with other sports related injuries, the most recommended treatment is RICE therapy. This method is important to prevent damage to the muscle and decrease <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. It is important to remember to rest the muscle as a smaller injury can become worse without rest. In addition, elevating the hamstring with an ice pack can prevent inflammation and swelling by constricting the blood vessels supplying the area. An ACE wrap or a compression dressing can serve to do the same and can decrease inflammation related swelling. 
It is important to make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to undergo a thorough examination of the area to ensure that you have not torn your muscle as soon as possible. "
Should I have surgery on my finger?,"If you never saw your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> after jamming your finger, you should do so now. The one finger <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> that sometimes requires <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> is a broken bone. Granted, if there was not major deformity of the finger or pain after you injured it, then it is unlikely that you broke it and, furthermore, it would be too late to fix many minor finger fractures at this point. Nevertheless, your doctor will be able to examine the finger to make sure there is no major problem and may take an x-ray to rule out a poorly healing fracture. 

I think more likely, however, is that the sprain you sustained (which is what a 'jammed finger' is) is still just healing. Most people don't entirely appreciate how long it takes for a sprain to heal, and I think it is totally reasonable to still be experiencing some mild discomfort even 1 month out. This should gradually continue to get better with time, as long as you are careful and don't reinjure the finger. 

Again, please talk to your primary care doctor about the issue; he or she will be able to answer any additional questions you might have. "
If I sprained my achilles tendon will it be likely to tear in the future?,"The achilles tendon is one of the largest tendons in the body. Although it is very strong, when it is injured it takes a long time to heal, because of its relative size and relative lack of blood flow. For this reason it is important to pay close attention to achilles tendon injuries. 

If you allow the tendon to heal up completely prior to engaging in vigorous physical exercise again, then you should not be at any increased risk of tearing the tendon. However, if you stress it while it is still healing, you do put yourself at this risk. People who have achilles tendonitis or achilles sprains and continue to exercise are at risk of tendon tear or, worse yet, tendon rupture. 

I would suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They can assess the degree of <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> that you have sustained to the tendon and provide you with recommendations on what level of activity you should perform. 

If the sprain is very severe, they may recommend that your wear a supportive boot on the ankle, or they may refer you to an orthopedic doctor or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> for additional advice and management. "
Is there anything a doctor can do for a broken rib?,"It is hard to tell if you have a rib fracture or just a chest contusion (bruise). Rib fractures can be diagnosed with X-rays or CT scans of the chest. In general, rib fractures are treated with pain control and time, so your father is correct. Because of the abundant network of muscle and connective tissue holding each rib in place most rib fractures are actually held in place pretty well and heal fine without a need for repair. 

Rib fractures are mostly encountered in trauma patients (assault, car accident, fall, etc). There was a time when rib fractures were repaired by <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeons</a> where the ribs were ""plated."" meaning the two ends of the ribs were aligned and a metal or plastic plate was place over the fracture and screws or sutures were used to secure everything in position. However, we as <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctors</a> and surgeons have gotten away from that because all of our studies that compared outcomes of surgical intervention vs watchful waiting failed to show any advantage with respect to healing time, function, pain, etc. In essence, we found that the surgery just added expense without any actual benefit. Because of this, most simple rib fractures are now treated conservatively, non-operatively. I would still recommend that you get checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and get at least a chest x-ray to diagnose or rule out rib fracture(s). The other reason to get a chest x-ray is to rule out a pneumothorax (""dropped lung"") which actually can be life threatening and would need a temporary chest tube or catheter placement. If you notice shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, you should proceed immediately to the closest emergency room. "
Do I have shin splints?,"Your leg pain sounds like it could be secondary to shin splint (also called medial tibial stress syndrome or MTSS). This syndrome occurs frequently in sports involving quick starts and stops such as in basketball, soccer, tennis, gymnastics, and even in marching bands or any sports requiring a lot of force on the muscle groups with attachments to the tibia or shin bone. It is a very common problem in athletes. About 15% of runners and 20% of aerobic dancers have been reported to experience shin splint. Chronic stress or muscle injuries may lead to micro-injuries of the fibrous connective tissue to the periosteum. Tendons and ligaments are not rich in blood supply so repairing or healing these injuries usually take much longer than your muscles.  It is a clinical diagnosis (by history and physical exam) but a plain <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> of the tibia or a 3-phase bone scan is sometimes recommended to differentiate it from other causes of chronic leg pain, such as a hair-line <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>. The treatment is REST, ICE, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Of course, rest is the most important factor in limiting further injuries and allowing the tissues to heal. When detected early, it can take several weeks to heal for mild cases, but chronic and severe cases may take several months to recover. You should seek out a sport medicine <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> for help who can best evaluate and advise you on possible therapies. "
Can you still be injured without experiencing pain?,"I think the fact that your need does not hurt is a good sign. Almost always, when you damage a knee playing sports, there is pain afterwards. This pain comes from stretched or otherwise inflamed ligaments and connective tissue. It is generally reasonable to assume that, if you don't have any pain, then you probably haven't caused any significant damage to these tissues. 

There are some caveats, however. It is technically possible, although unlikely, to cause isolated damage to some structures in the knee without having a lot of swelling or pain. Therefore, you should be on the lookout for additional symptoms. In particular if the knee feels ""weak"" or feelings like it is ""giving out"" you should seek medical attention. Furthermore if you have a grinding sensation or a ""catch"" in the knee when you flex it you should seek medical attention. 

Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should take a quick look at the knee. He or she will look for any evidence of tenderness or inflammation as well as any evidence of joint instability. If they find anything, they will likely want to do additional testing or referral, including potentially a visit with a sports medicine or orthopedic doctor. "
Is there a way to tell the difference between a break and a sprain?,"A physical exam is helpful but it is difficult to tell any bone fractures (other than those with obvious deformities) without appropriate imaging. If you can't bear any weight on your ankle after the <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, then a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> is a possibility. Many athletes sprain their ankles, and it can take a few days to weeks to heal, but a fracture would not allow you to bear weight for at least 6 weeks, or even longer if you do not keep it immobilized. Ruling out a bone fracture is important as the treatment for it is very different from soft tissue trauma. Bones heal slowly and methodically with cell layering down a foundation like miniature bridges.  This does not work well unless the two broken ends are kept relatively fixed. Otherwise, even slight movements will cause constant micro-traumas, thus preventing optimal healing. On the other hand, a sprain can often heal with rest and ice and by keeping the affected area elevated whenever possible. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are often helpful in decreasing the amount of swelling and inflammation inherent to every injury. Minimizing the swelling and inflammation will lessen secondary injuries and allow the tissues to get nutrients easier for healing. Other things that can help you heal faster include avoiding tobacco smoke, getting good nutrition, and adequate rest.  I would recommend a visit with a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> for an evaluation and more information.  "
Why is my calf so sore?,"Given the fact that you exercise frequently, I think the most likely cause is that you have a strain or sprain of the muscle. This may have occurred even without you noticing any obvious <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>. You may want to try some gentle stretching exercises, as well as some anti inflammatory medications, and see if that makes a difference. If not, you may want to back off on your exercise regimen, at least for a while, until things start to improve. 

The other possible cause that one wouldn't want to miss would be a blood clot in the leg. This is unusual in people who are as physically active as you, but it could occur, especially if you recently found yourself sitting for a long period of time (for example on a long plane flight). Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg, other than pain, including swelling or having one calf appear larger than the other. If you notice this, this is a medical emergency and you would need to see medical help immediately. Similarly, if you have any sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations these might be signs of a moving blood clot and you need to seek emergency help. "
Will my shoulder ever go back to normal after it has been dislocated?,"I am glad that you seemingly have not had a permanent serious injury, but you should definitely follow up with your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> about this. There is a risk of recurrent shoulder dislocation after having one shoulder dislocation, but the risk depends a lot on what the initial injury was like. For example, if the dislocation occurred after only a minor blow, then this means that you have latent shoulder instability and you will be at risk for future dislocations. On the other hand, if the dislocation occurred after a major blow, you might not have elevated risk. Similarly, anterior shoulder dislocations are more likely to lead to permanent shoulder instability than posterior shoulder dislocations. Also if you have a family or personal history of certain connective tissue conditions such as Marfan's syndrome or Ehler-Danlos syndrome, these will also raise your risk of having recurrent should dislocations. 

I would suggest that you talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> about the injury you had. Together, you will be able to determine what your future risk might be. This is important to determine, because it may affect the kinds of sports that you can participate in safely. "
What are shin splints?,"This sounds a great deal like shin splints. Shin splints are known medically as medial tibial stress syndrome, and they are essentially an overuse injury to the muscles and connective tissue that run along the tibia (shin bone). The typical symptoms are aching or stabbing pain in this region with high impact exercise. If you think you might have shin splints, it could be helpful to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who can confirm the diagnosis for you; sometimes it is helpful to get x-rays to rule out a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>, although this is not always needed. 

Unfortunately, the primary treatment for shin splints is rest! Since it is an overuse injury, it is important to give the affected tissue time to heal. This means, at a minimum, no running on hard surfaces, and if the pain is still persistent may require more complete rest. Icing the affected areas can help, as can taking anti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. 

It can also be helpful to determine if you have an over pronating stride, as this is a common cause of shin splints. Your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> should be able to determine this for you and, if so, help you find a pair of shoes that correct for the pronation. "
Should I wear an ankle brace?,"Glad to hear that your ankle is feeling back to normal. Sprains do take a very long time to heal, sometimes weeks to months, so make sure you take it easy and don't stress the ankle too much!

I think the most important thing when deciding whether or not to go back to sports after an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> is to determine whether you still have any residual pain or weakness. If so, it is worth going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a quick examination to make sure that the ankle is stable and sports-worthy. 

Once you do have clearance from your doctor, you should not need to wear a brace. <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">Braces</a> are primarily used in the healing phase of a sprain to immobilize the damaged ligaments and help them heal up. The exception to this would be if your doctor finds that you still have significant ankle instability; however, if the joint is unstable that would argue against starting back into sports altogether at this time. 

Once you do start exercising again, make sure you go slow. Exercise less intensely than you normally would and for shorter periods of time. Slow down or rest if you feel discomfort of any sort."
Why is my knee weak all of the sudden?,"First of all, you should definitely stop running until you figure this out. Knee injuries with running are very common, given that running is such a high impact form of exercise. As always, the most important step in healing up an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> is proper rest from the sport or exercise for that is causing the problem. 

There are several potential knee injuries from running. Serious injuries, such as ligament tears, happen rarely but are important to recognize. With a serious ligament injury, you will feel a looseness or slipping in the knee joint, or a 'catch' when you bend the knee. If you feel this, you should see a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> immediately. 

More common are overuse or repetitive strain injuries, such as iliotibial band syndrome or patello femoral pain syndrome. These syndromes cause pain and weakness on the outer edge and front of the knee, respectively, and they usually respond to rest and backing off on your training regimen a bit. 

The first step here is to see your doctor. They will be able to examine the knee for serious injury and make a preliminary diagnosis, as well as prescribe treatment, which may include rest, anti inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. "
What is the best way to get my muscles to relax?,"Glad to hear that you are working out and taking care of yourself, but sorry to hear that you strained a muscle in your neck while doing it. You should get checked out by a physician. While this sounds like only a muscle strain, a neck <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> such as a prolapsed or ruptured disc can be a very serious thing. For this reason if you have any <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> or tingling in either arm or your legs, then you should go to the emergency room or see a <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a> to be evaluated. With that being said, most muscle strains can be easily treated conservatively without taking any prescription medications. Initially I usually recommend icing the injured muscle to decrease inflammation. A good rule of thumb is 20 minutes on, 20 off. I would do this a few times a day for the first week or so depending on how bad the injury was. I know you don't want to take medication, but over the counter ibuprofen (motrin) can be helpful to decrease the inflammation and decrease pain. Just follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. Lastly heat and stretching can be your friend as you try to regain mobility. Try passive (gentle stretching) followed by 20 minutes of a heat pad and some stretching afterwards. You should notice that over time your mobility increases. Some muscle strains can take a while to completely heal, but most have improved significantly in about 2 weeks. If you haven;t noticed significant improvement in a couple weeks then definitely go get checked out. Also this may be obvious, but until you are completely healed you shouldn't continue to lift and risk further injury. I hope this is helpful. Bet of luck.  "
Does chondromalacia patella ever go away?,"Chondromalcia patella, or patello femoral pain syndrome, or runner's knee (the condition has many names) does take a long time to resolve sometimes! Given that this has been going on almost a year for you and that it is impacting your ability to play high school supports, I highly recommend that you go to see a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> or an athletic trainer who specializes in this condition if you have not done so already. 

Chondromalacia patella occurs when the knee cap does not track properly over the thigh bone (femur). This causes some break down of the cartilage on the undersurface of the knee cap, leading to pain especially with exercise or when the knees are bent. In addition to resting from vigorous athletic activity, physical therapy can help. However, it has to be a type of physical therapy which is directed at strengthening the quadriceps muscles, as often an imbalance in the quadriceps muscles underlies chondromalacia patella. Also it is helpful to wear shoes that correct for over pronation, if this is a problem you suffer from. 

Start by going to see a sports medicine doctor, as I think they will have a lot of helpful suggestions. "
Can not stretching before I ran have caused my hip to hurt?,"Most aches and pains from running are actually simply the result of over training (running too fast or running too far) or of training on hard surfaces (running on concrete). Running is one of the higher impact forms of aerobic exercises, and the forces of your body hitting the pavement are transmitted up your legs into your knees and hips. 

Stretching may help you be able to train harder or longer without having these injuries, and so you should definitely make it part of your routine. Especially, certain types of over use injuries associated with running, such as iliotibial band syndrome, are very responsive to stretching out the affected, stiffened connective tissue. 

In general, however, you should try to avoid running so long or so hard that you have significant pain afterwards. If you are in pain, you should let your body recuperate before going at it again. Make sure you always wear a good pair of shoes, and change them out when they start to wear down. 

If the pain is not improving with rest and backing off a bit on your training regimen, you should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> just to make sure there is not a more serious <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> going on. "
Will ice help my wrist problems?,"Ice is a great way to decrease inflammation and alleviate sore muscles and joints. Sore wrists in sports players or others who use their hands extensively are very common, and can be a minor or major inconvenience. Unfortunately, the minor inconveniences can occasionally become major inconveniences if they persist or become worse. For many people, an over the counter anti-inflammatory such as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID, eg, ibuprofen or naprosyn) and ice are sufficient to alleviate the symptoms. Others find that they need something more powerful, and seek help from their primary care doctors or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a>. A good rule of thumb for all of us that engage in regular physical activity is that if something hurts, then you should avoid it. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum and what it takes to relieve your pain, the fact that you have had continued <a href=""/procedure/wrist-pain-1091"">wrist pain</a> indicates that you should speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about your problem to see if there is anything that can be done to keep the problem from becoming worse, and to minimize the symptoms currently. Please speak to your doctor or a sports medicine specialist. "
Is wrist pain common among tennis players?,"A good rule of thumb for anyone that engages in regular physical activity is that, if something hurts, you should avoid it. Obviously, tennis provides excellent cardiovascular exercise that is beneficial to your health and well being (in addition to being enjoyable!), and so it would be good to feel well enough to continue. Tennis does frequently cause pain and overuse injuries to many parts of the body, including the wrist and elbow. Unfortunately, continuing to use an injured joint or muscle causes us to adapt to protect the injured body part, which makes us use movements that are not typical and can lead to increased injury in the same body part or even the other parts that may be attempting to over-correct for the injury. <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">Braces</a> can provide some protection, but should be used with care as they can, ironically, make injuries more likely if not used correctly, or even in the brief spans where you are not using the brace. For this reason, any chronic pain, which it appears that you are having, should be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. In instances of sports related injuries like yours, a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> might provide additional insight, and your primary care doctor can refer you to one as needed. Please speak with your doctor. "
Why would my stomach hurt all the time even after I eat?,"I am sorry to hear that you have had bowel problems before, and sincerely hope that you do not have to suffer from that problem again. Pain after eating (post-prandial, as it is known to doctors) can be a sign of many different medical problems, ranging from your gall bladder to your bowels and many things in between. It would be important to know if you have had bowel <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> in the past, and if there is anything else that is noteworthy in your history. Infectious colitis can be a recurrent problem in some people, and if your symptoms are similar or concerning given what you experienced with your last episode a year ago, then it would be important to speak with a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> very urgently. The way that you phrase the question does seem to imply that this is an ongoing problem, however, which may give you time to make an appointment. Your doctor would know your history the best and may be able to immediately suggest further tests to determine what is causing these pains and the weight gain. Additionally, gaining weight rapidly could be concerning for other problems, such as your heart. Please speak with your doctor soon. "
"Abnormal bowel movements - Does this sound like a side effect of medication, or something else?","Your symptoms sound most unpleasant!  I'm sorry that you are dealing with this, and it definitely sounds like something you should explore further with your physician right away.  Many medications can indeed cause constipation, including both of your medications.  If you have been on the paroxetine for 2 years and this problem didn't really get most pronounced until after the bupropion started, then it is possible that the two agents together is part of what is causing this unpleasant side effect.  It will be important to exclude an underlying issue with your GI tract--which is why you should see your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> about this right away--but hopefully this is a case of side effect management.  If these two medications are helping your mental health significantly it would be nice if you can devise a bowel regimen that helps control your GI side effects but lets you continue on with the meds if they are working for you.  However, it might be that switching the bupropion to another agent might help better control these side effects in a manageable way. This risk/benefit conversation will be an important one to have with your physician.

However, he or she will likely also want to check in with you about any other concerning symptoms and perform a physical exam to make sure that there isn't something else going on.  Hopefully you'll be back to your normal self soon!"
Why do I have chest pain on my right side while eating after an endoscopy?,"Endoscopy can lead to some side effects, most of which should resolve shortly after the procedure.  Many patients will report some throat discomfort following the procedure, but you should not be having persistent severe pain or marked difficulty eating/swallowing several days after the procedure.  In this situation, the best thing to do is to contact your endoscopist right away to discuss your symptoms.  Your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> may want to send you straight to the emergency room for further evaluation or he or she may want you to come into the office for an evaluation.  Depending upon what kind of procedures were done during the endoscopy (biopsies, for example) you may expect some slightly different symptoms in the several days following the procedure, but it is important that your doctor hear about what you have been experiencing to help triage this situation.  As you know, there are some risks with any procedure, including endoscopy, and that is why it is important that any symptoms post-procedure be discussed with the physician who performed it.  Hopefully you'll be feeling back to your old self shortly, but in the meantime, if you experience any sudden difficulty breathing, fevers, or severe chest pain, you should go straight to an emergency room."
Is there a decent alternative to a colonoscopy for a 28-year-old male? ,"A colonoscopy is the gold standard when it comes to diagnosing problems of the lower intestinal tract. The procedure involves a prep period the evening before the procedure, when laxatives are consumed in order to clear out the intestines. While this can be a bit uncomfortable, it is necessary in order for the <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> to get a good view during the procedure. The procedure itself is almost always done under conscious sedation with the use of IV medication to help the patient relax and treat any discomfort; in this setting most patients may not even recall the procedure being done. In the proper hands, the procedure is very safe with a low complication rate. If you have concerns, I recommend speaking with your gastroenterologist.

There are other ways of investigating the GI tract as well. Imaging studies such as CT scan or <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> can show inflammatory changes or structural disease, but do not allow for direct visualization of the intestinal mucosa or <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> of any abnormal areas. A flexible sigmoidoscopy also involves the use of a scope inserted into the rectum, and while the procedure does not involve an extensive prep, it is usually done after an enema. With this procedure, only the last portion of the intestine is visualized and not the entire colon. 

The gastroenterologist likely recommended the colonoscopy to rule out any disease involving the mucosal lining of the intestine that could be causing your pain and change in bowel movements. If you have any further questions regarding the need for the procedure or the possibility of proceeding with your work-up via a different method, it is advised that you discuss this further with your gastroenterologist. "
My mom took the Fibroscan® and the HCV result was 4.3 KpA; is that bad?,"A few things to answer your question....First, I am sorry to hear that you and your mother are having to go through any of this. Never pleasant to have to be on pins and needles. Second, it's important to discuss your test results with the <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> that ordered the test. What can be good in one situation could be quite the opposite in the other, depending on why your doctor ordered the test. For example, the Fibroscan is a type of <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> test (meaning that it relies in part on sound waves and the interpretations of how those sound waves bounce off of each other and other things) that is often used to detect the stiffness of the liver. Your doctor would want to check the stiffness because, with time and scarring, the stiffness of the liver can change. Just like other parts of your body, your liver can scar due to injuries that occur, and, as you know, hepatitis C can cause liver <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> that could be life threatening. By checking the stiffness of your liver, your doctor was likely trying to get an understanding of how much damage had been done. Again, important to check with your doctor and know the specifics of what your mom is expecting before the test results have any real meaning, but, outside of any other reference, 4.3 is not a terribly high level of stiffness, which could be good. As always, please speak to your doctor for the full explanation and to understand how these test results relate to your situation. Encourage your mother to book an appointment today."
"Why do I have blood in my urine, stool, and vomit?","I'm sorry that you are feeling so badly. These symptoms are quite concerning, and they definitely need to be checked out by a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> as soon as possible. I would recommend either going to an emergency room for rapid evaluation or booking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> immediately. 

Blood in the stool and vomit could be caused by a number of things, including infections of the intestinal tract, constipation, etc. However, the most serious and life threatening cause of blood in the stool and vomit is an intestinal bleed, and this is what needs to be ruled out right away. If there is any evidence of a bleed, which your doctor should be able to tell with a physical examination and some basic blood work, it may require hospitalization, so that your blood counts can be watched closely, you can be started on medications to suppress acid production in the stomach, and you can have urgent evaluation by a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>. The blood in your urine is harder to tie in with the other symptoms, but I wonder if you might just have blood mixed in your urine because of the blood in your stool.

Is it safe to fly to Europe after a rubber band ligation?,"It is very prescient of you to consider the risks associated with traveling, especially far from home, after any kind of medical procedure.  Overall it sounds like your procedure went very smoothly and you are making a good recovery.  Any concerns about a potential procedure or side effects afterwards are always best answered by the physician in charge of the procedure or <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, and you have done exactly the right thing in talking with your physician about this.  If he feels comfortable with you traveling, then you should feel at ease about taking your trip.  You are correct that there can be side effects further out from the procedure you had, but these are generally in patients who may have had additional comorbidities that it doesn't seem that you do, from your physician's response.  The bottom line is that you have to be comfortable with the decisions that you make about your health, so if you are still concerned about your physician's advice, it is reasonable to make an appointment with him or even seek a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> if you are that worried about it.  However, it is also true that even the most brilliant and caring physician cannot predict the future with 100% accuracy, so if you are going to be worried about your health the entire time, then it may be in your best interest to forego this particular trip."
What can cause stomach pains after passing a stool?,"This would be an issue that is important to address with a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>. I would suggest starting with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> if you already have one. 

There are several potential causes of your pain. For example, sometimes constipation alone can produce this sort of pain with defecation, due to insufficient emptying of the colon or excessive straining to pass hard stool. 

Cramping with defecation can also be a sign of a serious condition called inflammatory bowel disease (with two different types, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). In addition to cramping, other symptoms could include frequent loose bowel movements or blood in your bowel movements. 

Irritation around the anus can also lead to pain with defecation. Typically, this irritation could be from hemorrhoids or from an anal fissure, and would tend to cause pain that was more localized to the rectal area than general abdominal pain. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a general examination and help determine if this is something that you need to be worried about. If necessary, they can order additional tests (such as basic blood work or tests on a stool sample) to help figure out exactly what the diagnosis is. Book an appointment today."
How can you differentiate between a stomach bug and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?,"<a href=""/procedure/irritable-bowel-syndrome-1294"">Irritable Bowel Syndrome</a> is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that doctors have to be able to prove that there is nothing more serious going on before they can tell you that you have IBS. That is because IBS then becomes an explanation for a wide variety of symptoms that you may have in the future, and doctors will not have to constantly test you on every new occasion of loose stools or changes in your complaints. You should definitely discuss your concerns with your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>.

As for your current symptoms that you are having, the best way to tell between a normal infectious cause of loose stool and IBS is by your history. Have you eaten anything new or tried a new restaurant? Are others around you also ill? Do you have a fever, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, or vomiting that may be symptoms of something else? Are there other symptoms that are concerning to you or your doctor? Any of these would or may be more likely to be signs of a stomach bug. If, however, your symptoms are otherwise nonexistent and you only have a worsening of your usual loose stool, then it is quite possible that this is just an exacerbation of your existing IBS. As always, please speak to your doctor."
What is recovery like after colon cancer?,"This sounds like great news! It sounds like the worst part is already behind her! It does sound like she has gotten pretty standard treatment for routine colon cancer, which includes surgery to remove the tumor as well as <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> to ""catch"" any microscopic cancers that may be left in the body but that were undetectable to the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>'s eye. 

The basic followup after successful treatment for colon cancer involves regular visits with the surgeon or <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctor</a>. At first these visits may be as frequent as every three months, and then they tend to be spaced out as long as the patient is still healthy and doing well. The purpose of these visits is to look for any danger signs that might be evidence of recurring cancer. At these visits, blood work for ""tumor markers"" that are associated with colon cancer are often check, as undetectable levels of these tumor markers is evidence that the cancer remains in remission, whereas rising levels may indicate that the cancer has come back.

Additionally, after colon cancer people will often have significant physical therapy or other rehabilitation needs, as the surgery can be quite hard and can leave one quite debilitated. Your friend should discuss recovery in more detail with her surgeon or cancer doctor if she has additional questions. "
What are liver spots?,"Liver spots could be from multiple causes, and are more of a description than an actual diagnoses. It would take speaking to her <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>, who knows more about her background and medical history, to get the best answer. Additionally, the way that the spots look on whatever test was ordered would provide valuable information that would help with the full diagnosis of what these is and how they will affect her going forward. Depending on her history and what these spots look like, they could vary anywhere from benign, normal findings all the way to life threatening signs of something as serious as a cancer. With only the information that you provide in the question it is impossible to tell more details, so I highly recommend speaking to the doctor about this. Usually, the liver will appear relatively homogenous (the same throughout) on imaging such as ultrasounds and advanced xrays like CT scans. When there are changes within the body of the liver itself, these can appear as spots within the liver. Again, depending on her history, your doctor may feel the need to get a <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> of the spots, which can sometimes be done with a needle. Other times, he or she may choose to leave them alone. Please speak to her doctor for more information."
What is causing my bad breath?,"Sorry to hear that this has been such a persistent problem for you! The first question I would have is about the results from your most recent endoscopy. According to the information you provide, the endoscopy showed inflammation in the mouth and throat and Helicobacter infection in the stomach. Taken together, this all suggests that you have ongoing trouble with acid production and inflammation in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This could definitely cause your bad breath problems. Therefore, the first thing I would recommend is discussing these findings with a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>, to see if treatment to eradicate the Helicobacter infection and to more aggressively suppress stomach acid production is in order. 

Next, it would be good to get a clean bill of health from your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>, if you have not done so in a while. Inflammation or infection of the gums (gingivitis) or cavities of the teeth are one of the most common (and most easily treatable) causes of bad breath. 

Finally, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> can investigate if you have any sinus congestion or nasal allergy component, as chronic nasal congestion and drainage of mucus into the back of the throat is another common cause of bad breath.

What causes a bloated stomach and constant burping only at night?,"I would highly recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue, especially since the symptoms seem fairly severe and are not improving with home medication remedies. 

The medications that you are taking right now at home for the symptoms are all medications that are used to treat heartburn, or acid reflux. I do think it is quite likely that you are experiencing a variant of acid reflux, especially given how the symptoms start at night (presumably after you have laid down) and are accompanied by burping. Sometimes, acid reflux can be quite severe and might not be responsive to nonprescription medications that you typically get in a pharmacy. 

It also may be the case that you have a more severe inflammation of the stomach, such as gastritis, or even a stomach <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">ulcer</a>. These may give similar symptoms as acid reflux, but will not always be as immediately responsive to medications. 

Your primary care doctor will be able to evaluate your symptoms and help you decide whether you need prescription strength medications and whether you need additional workup or referral to a specialist, such as a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>. Make an appointment as soon as you can."
What is causing pain where my esophagus meets my stomach?,"I strongly suggest that you follow up with your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> about this. It sounds like you have been being treated for gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is typically treated with anti acid medications like omeprazole or ranitidine. Both of these are excellent and safe medications, and it is important to continue taking them as directed by your doctor, because if you discontinue them then it will be more difficult to determine whether or not you have persistent symptoms resistant to treatment or persistent symptoms from not following the treatment. Your doctor should also know ASAP about the episode of questionable red-tinged liquid with <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>, as ruling out bleeding is also very important. 

In addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease, other things can also cause pain in this area of the stomach, including ulcers. Since you have already been tested for H pylori, which is a common infection that can cause these, then the next step (assuming you do not respond to treatment with the anti acid medications) would be referral to see a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>. The gastroenterologist will probably recommend an endoscopy, which is a procedure in which a small camera is inserted down your esophagus and into your stomach. This procedure can help better define exactly what is going on and what additional treatments might be needed. "
What causes stomach pain?,"It sounds like you are suffering from constipation! This is a really common medical problem, but it can be very uncomfortable and can require treatment by a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>. I would recommend seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who should be able to help figure out if you are constipated and what to do about it. 

There are many different causes of constipation, and it is obviously important to narrow things down, since the treatment depends a lot on the specific cause. For example, physical inactivity, a low fiber diet, and minimal liquid intake can all contribute to constipation. 

In other cases, a medication may be the cause. Many commonly used medications, such as certain medications used to treat <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a> or pain, can cause constipation. 

Additionally, there are other medical problems that may manifest with constipation. For example, trouble with the thyroid gland may lead to constipation, as may various gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a complete examination and help identify any underlying causes that needed to be treated directly. They will also be able to prescribe you some more quickly acting medications to solve the immediate problem and help you feel more comfortable. Again, please make an appointment today!"
Bleeding in my stool?,"There are several different causes of blood in the stool. Most of the time, this should be evaluated by your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> and sometimes it can be a serious medical emergency. 

If you are having copious bleeding with your bowel movements, severe abdominal pain, or if you feel lightheaded or dizzy, these could all be signs of significant intestinal bleeding. In which case, you should immediately call an ambulance or go to the emergency room for immediate evaluation. 

On the other hand, if this was just a small amount of bright red blood and if you otherwise feel well, you can go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at your earliest convenience. By far the most common cause of bleeding like this are hemorrhoids, but other forms of anal irritation, such as an anal fissure can also cause bleeding. In some cases, small amounts of bleeding may be a sign of a cancer in the colon. Your doctor will be able to examine for signs of hemorrhoids or other obvious problems. They can also help you decide if additional  workup might be needed. This workup could include a referral to a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> or a colonoscopy. 

Call your doctor as soon as you can!"
Does anal sex cause hemorrhoids?,"I'm sorry to hear that you are dealing with this issue! 

Hemorrhoids are dilated veins either surrounding or inside of the rectum. They can cause a number of symptoms, including pain with defecation and chronic itching of the rectal area. 

There are a number of causes of hemorrhoids, all of which result in chronic irritation and strain on the veins inside the rectum. These causes include chronic constipation (leading to straining with bowel movements) and being overweight. There is also some evidence that anal intercourse may contribute to the development of hemorrhoids, although this is disputed. What is definitely clear is that having anal intercourse in the presence of severe hemorrhoids can lead to persistent and more severe symptoms. 

I would strongly suggest that you discuss this issue with a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> or <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, if you have not done so already. They will be able to help you identify the potential causes of your hemorrhoids. Also, they will be able to help you figure out what medications can be used to improve your symptoms. In the most severe cases of hemorrhoids, a <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to remove the hemorrhoids may be the most appropriate move.

In the morning right before I have to poop I start gagging. What would cause this?,"I would strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue, or your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> if you have one. This is especially important if the symptoms have been going on for a while, as it is necessary to rule out any potentially serious medical problems. 

Chronic loose stools need to be worked up, as there are several treatable causes of these, including inflammatory bowel disease, infections in the intestines, and celiac disease. Make sure to mention to your doctor what exactly your bowel movements look like (color, odor, presence of any blood), as well as any other symptoms such as weight loss, joint pain, or rashes. This information will help them narrow down the possible causes. 

The gagging in the mornings also needs to be thought about. If you are having explosive loose stools in the morning, the gagging might be secondary to forceful cramping contractions of the intestines. On the other hand, especially if there is nausea or <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a>, there might be other problems, such a stomach ulcer, which need to be ruled out. 

Your doctor will be able to decide what additional testing you need to get to the bottom of this issue. 

Good luck!"
What do I become nauseous every time I eat?,"You should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. Any time that you experience persistent nausea, whether with food or without, it should be investigated by your doctor to rule out any serious medical problem. 

If this is an acute problem, occurring just for the last few days or so, then the most likely possibility is that you are suffering from a ""stomach bug"" such as a common viral infection. Other symptoms might include <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a>, fever, <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, or upper respiratory symptoms. Another common cause of acute nausea in women if childbearing age is pregnancy, and that should usually be ruled out. 

If this is more of a chronic problem, persistent for more than a week or two, then other causes need to be investigated. One of the most common causes of nausea after eating is an inflammation of the stomach lining (called gastritis) or an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine. These are often associated with smoking or alcohol intake, but they can also occur spontaneously or in the setting of an infection of the stomach with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. Another common cause of nausea after eating is gallstones or an inflammation of the gallbladder. 

Your doctor can determine what additional tests or treatment are needed!"
Scared and confused 54yr old women with Nash/Cirrhosis ,"I'm sorry to hear that you are dealing with this issue and the sudden flood of information! I definitely recommend that you sit down with both your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>, so that you can get answers to your questions and get a straight answer on what you need to do at this point. 

Although not totally clear from the information that you provided, it sounds like you previously carried a diagnosis of NASH and that this has now progressed to cirrhosis, which means that there is now evidence of scarring in the liver. The first thing I would recommend talking about with your doctor is making sure that other causes of cirrhosis, other than NASH, have all been ruled out. This may have already been done, but if not it is very important!

The next set of recommendations about repeated the scan and AFP levels are done to watch out for a liver tumor in the setting of liver cirrhosis, which increases your risk of developing a tumor. It does sound like the ""9 mm lesion"" that you have is unlikely to be a tumor. However, this repeated screening is pretty standard for all patients with cirrhosis, so would be likely repeated regardless.

How long do I need to be off Prevacid before my body can absorb all the vitamins necessary again? ,"Proton pump inhibitors medications like Prevacid (lansoprazole) are strong inhibitors of the stomach's acid production. As such, they are an important part of early treatment of stomach and duodenal ulcers, where they help to speed healing. It sounds like your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> now thinks that your ulcer has healed sufficiently that you do not need to take the medication on a daily basis, which is good news. 

Although Prevacid and medications like it are generally quite safe, there are a few side effects that your doctor monitors for. One of these is that occasionally these medications can cause impaired absorption of vitamin B12 in the body, which can lead to anemia and other problems. Similarly, there is some evidence regarding risk for osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related bone fractures. This may be because of impaired absorption or handling of calcium and vitamin D and, for this reason, some <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctors</a> will prescribe these supplements to people who are taking medications like Prevacid for a long time. 

Please speak with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your gastroenterologist about your concerns about Prevacid related vitamin deficiencies. They will be able to tell you whether or not you need to take any vitamin supplements or perform any testing to look for deficiencies. "
"The roof of my mouth started peeling last night, why?","The best thing to do would be to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It sounds like you have several issues that you need some assistance with, such as your smoking, your stomach <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">ulcer</a>, and your recent bouts of vomiting. Your primary care doctor will be able to help you address all of these things. 

Regarding your question specifically, there are several things that could be causing the peeling of the roof of your mouth. First, this could be caused by irritation to your mouth by the cigarette smoke. 

Second, it could be caused by acid reflux into your mouth, which might occur in the setting of a stomach ulcer and excess acid production or in the setting of frequent vomiting. 

Finally, the peeling could be related to an infection, such a herpes virus or other viral infection in the mouth. 

In addition to dealing with the peeling in your mouth, I am most concerned about the ulcer and vomiting, which seem like serious symptoms to me. Your primary care doctor can address these, but while you are waiting to see them, you should be on the lookout for any emergency symptoms. These include severe <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, intractable vomiting, or blood in your vomit or your bowel movements. Any of these symptoms should prompt you to go to the emergency room. Please see your doctor soon."
Unexplained water retention / bloating?,"I would suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue, since someone your age without any known medical problems should not be having persistent bloating with food. They will be able to perform an examination and help you figure out what may be going on. 

The first thing that bloating with food makes me think of is a problem with the stomach. There are several different stomach conditions that can present with pain or bloating with eating, including gastritis or a stomach ulcer. 

Similarly, a problem with the gall bladder, such as gall stones, may cause bloating, especially after eating a heavy meal with a high fat content. 

Bloating may also be a sign of constipation, which can sometimes present slowly and gradually so that you are not even aware of it. 

Finally, bloating may be a symptom of various <a href=""/procedure/food-intolerance-allergy-168"">food intolerance</a> problems, such as lactose intolerance (it sounds like you are avoiding lactose already however) or celiac disease. 

Your doctor will be able to narrow down the possibilities after performing a physical exam. Based on what they find, they may want to get other testing, such as x-rays, an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>, or basic blood work. Good luck, and please make an appointment to see your doctor."
"I have stomach aches at least 5 times a day, why?","I would suggest talking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> about this problem. Any chronic stomach complaint should be investigated by a doctor to make sure it is not caused by a serious medical problem requiring treatment. 

One cause of intermittent abdominal pain would be gastritis, which is an inflammation of the stomach lining, or a stomach ulcer. These are often associated with smoking, alcohol use, or some over the counter pain medications. However, they can also be caused by infection of the stomach with a bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori. 

Another cause would be a food intolerance, such as celiac disease or lactose intolerance. Both of these conditions can cause crampy abdominal pain, bloating, and other symptoms such as fatigue or <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>. 

Similarly, irritable bowel syndrome is a very common cause of intermittent abdominal pain. With irritable bowel syndrome, the pain is often made worse in times of stress or fatigue, and it may be associated with either intermittent diarrhea or constipation. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a complete physical examination and help figure out what might be going on. They may want to perform some additional laboratory studies, such as basic blood work or studies on your feces. Good luck."
Why after bowel movements do I have stomach pain?,"Any case of chronic <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a> that has been going on for a while without relief definitely needs to be checked out by a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> or by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. There are several potential medical causes for your pain, and your doctor can both help you find a diagnosis and identify effective treatments to start feeling better!

For example, hemorrhoids are often associated with chronic straining, such as might be caused by persistent constipation. The fact that you have some small stools followed by cramping pain might go along with a diagnosis of constipation as well. 

Alternatively, there are numerous food intolerances, such as lactose intolerance or celiac disease, which can cause chronic abdominal pain as well as irregular bowel movements. 

Irritable bowel syndrome is another very common condition that is characterized by intermittent abdominal pain that is often made worse in times of stress or fatigue. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a general physical examination and then help you figure out what tests need to be done next to sort this out. These tests could include basic blood tests, tests on your fecal material, or radiology studies (such as an ultrasound) to look at the anatomy of the abdominal organs. Good luck."
"My stomach hurts a lot, what could it be?","Chronic stomach pains with eating can definitely be a sign of an underlying medical problem. Since this has been going on for a really long time, there is probably no emergency but it would still be worth talking about the issue with your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> the next time you see them. They can help figure out whether you need additional testing or treatment. 

For example, sometimes the lining of the stomach can become inflamed. This is called gastritis. It is associated with smoking and alcohol, but it can also occur in some individuals infected with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, which can respond to antacids and antibiotic medications. 

Also, there are a number of different food intolerances which could be associated with <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a>. For example, lactose intolerance can cause pain whenever dairy is eaten. Similarly, celiac disease is caused by a reaction to wheat gluten, and it can lead to chronic stomach pain, cramping, and <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>. 

Please set up a visit with your doctor! When you go to see them, make sure to tell them about things like any association of symptoms with particular foods, any changes in your bowel movements, any blood in your bowel movements, or any weight loss, as these will help them narrow down the possible causes.

How can my wife get the exact Hepatitis B anti-body level? ,"As you probably know, the hepatitis B vaccine is a series of three shots that are given over a period of several months to produce immunity to the hepatitis B virus. The vaccine is effective in those who respond to it, however a small but significant proportion of people who receive the vaccine will not produce detectable antibody levels in their blood stream after receiving the vaccine and, therefore, might not be immune to the virus. 

Therefore, in situations where it is important to document immunity, it is common to draw a blood test looking for antibodies after completing the vaccinations. This test specifically tests antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen. It is not generally reported as the ""exact"" antibody level, but rather as positive or negative. If positive, the person is immune to the hepatitis B virus. If, on the other hand, the test is negative then the person is one of those who did not respond adequately to vaccination, and they may need to have  a booster dose of the vaccine. 

Your wife should talk to her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. They can order the necessary blood tests to determine whether or not she has immunity to hepatitis B. "
What types of food can I eat if I have ulcerative colitis?,"Sorry to hear that you are dealing with <a href=""/procedure/ulcerative-colitis-1068"">ulcerative colitis</a>! The good new is that, with medications and dietary management, many people experience significant improvement in their symptoms. It is important to continue to have regular visits with your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">GI doctor</a> and, potentially, with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>. 

The first principle of diet for people with ulcerative colitis is to make sure that you get plenty of calories. People with bad ulcerative colitis flares my lose a lot of weight or become malnourished, and so boosting your diet with extra calories is important. You may want to meet with a nutritionist to discuss specific strategies to ensure that you are getting sufficient calories. 

For some people, a low fiber diet is also helpful, because it slows down the passage of stools in the intestines, leading to less frequent bowel movements. It is not necessary to eliminate fiber entirely, but if you can limit yourself to 10 or 15 grams per day, that could be helpful. Again, a nutritionist could help you develop this plan, and reading food labels for fiber content is also very helpful. 

Finally, in some people with ulcerative colitis, there are specific food triggers that make symptoms worse. These are different from person to person, but keeping a food diary might be helpful for you. If you identify a specific food that makes your symptoms worse, then you can avoid that food. Of course, you should speak with your doctor before embarking on any changes. Good luck!"
I have extreme stomach cramping. Why?,"It would be important to know how many bowel movements you are having right now, and how frequently. When people are diagnosed with rapid transit problems, it is common to put them on medications that slow down the intestines. However, it is really common to overswing and end up really constipated!

Therefore, if you are having bloating, cramping, and infrequent hard stools, then this is probably what is going on. If so, I would call your gastroenterologist's office right away to let them know and ask for advice. They will probably, at a minimum, tell you to stop taking the loperamide, as that is the primary constipating medication. Once you have resumed a more normal bowel movement cycle, you can again begin playing around with the doses of the loperamide to slow things down enough, but without causing the constipation. 

If the <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> is severe or if you have any other serious symptoms, such as fever, or vomiting, then this might be a different problem altogether that requires more immediate evaluation. In that case, if you can't get in to see your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> right away, you should go to the emergency room for evaluation to rule out things like appendicitis. "
Nausea from noon until midnight?,"Stomach symptoms like this that are persistent should be checked out by a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>, both to make sure nothing serious is wrong and also to help you figure out a treatment plan to get some relief from the symptoms. You could start by making an appointment with your primary care or <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a>. 

The fact that you are having both nausea and also bad acid reflux symptoms at the same time does suggest that these two symptoms may be related to each other. For example, sometimes the stomach can become inflamed, a condition called gastritis. When this occurs, both nausea and heartburn, as well as <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, are common symptoms. Gastritis is typically caused by irritation of the stomach from thinks like alcohol, over the counter pain medicines, or smoking. However, it may also be caused by infection of the stomach with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. 

When you go to see your doctor, make sure to mention if you have any other concerning symptoms, especially pain with eating, blood or dark coloration in your bowel movements, or weight loss. Your doctor will perform an exam and they may order blood or stool tests to help work up this problem further. "
Is it okay that I haven't had a bowel movement in seven days?,"You need to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or the <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterology</a> specialist who prescribed these medications for you, right away. 

It sounds like the medications you are taking for rapid transit, especially the loperamide, has been too constipating for you, and 7 days is a long time to go without a bowel movement. With long standing constipation like this, the fecal material tends to become compacted and hardened, making it increasingly more difficult to expel. 

Often, more aggressive medications are needed to break up the stool and help you pass it. These medications may include additional oral medications, suppositories, or even enemas, based on what your doctor thinks is necessary. 

While you are waiting to see your doctor, you can also stop the loperamide, which is most likely driving the constipation, and continue to drink lots of fluids. Additionally, if you develop any severe abdominal pain, fever, or nausea and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> these could be signs of a more serious complication, and you should not wait to see your doctor in their office. Rather, you should go to the nearest emergency room for a expedited evaluation.

"Recently, when I eat get these loud hiccups and my esophogus hurts. Why? ","I would recommend going back to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. It sounds like some initial workup has already occurred, such as looking for specific food allergies and also trying anti acid medications. However, there are a few other things that still need to be sorted out. 

First of all, I would want to make sure that you have been tested for celiac disease, which is an intolerance to gluten. This may have already been done as part of your blood work, but if not your doctor may want to do it. 

Also, sometimes there can be <a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">acid reflux</a> or stomach irritation that is not responsive to omeprazole. Often, these cases are because the stomach is infected with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. A simple lab test performed on a fecal sample can determine if you infected with this bacteria. If so, a course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor should take care of it. 

If these steps don't lead to results, your doctor may want to refer you to a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterology</a> specialist, because it may be necessary to perform an endoscopy, which is a procedure in which a camera is inserted into the esophagus and stomach to try to figure out what is going on. "
Can I get a stomach transplant?,"While many organs can be transplanted from one patient to another, stomach transplants are generally not done. This is because the stomach is considered a non-essential organ, meaning that a person can live without his or her stomach. When organs are transplanted, the person receiving the transplant must take medications (usually for the rest of his or her life) to suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the foreign organ. These medications are not benign, and carry of the risk of increasing susceptibility for infection and certain types of cancer. As such, organs are transplanted when only deemed absolutely necessary to prolong life or improve quality of life when the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. 

Even if it were possible that your stomach was restored back to normal, your nausea may not resolve. You should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>, or the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> that performed your operation about your symptoms and the treatment options that are available."
Do I need a colostomy for diverticulosis if I had hemicolectomy?,"Diverticulosis is a condition in which small outpouchings of the wall of the colon form, thought to be due to increased pressure within the walls of the intestine. This is a very common finding, especially in the older population, and unfortunately is a very common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. On the one hand, sometimes a diverticular bleed is insignificant and resolves spontaneously without the need for further action. On the other hand, a diverticular bleed can be very serious and even life-threatening, requiring support with blood transfusions and occasionally an intervention such as arterial embolization by an interventional <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> or removal of the affected segment by surgery. 

The decision about proceeding to surgery either during or after an episode of diverticular bleeding depends on many factors, including the duration/severity of bleeding, the risk of re-bleeding in the future, and the overall health of the patient and his/her suitability for surgery.

It is strongly advised that you seek out the opinions of your doctors (such as your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> and <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>) to obtain further answers to all of your questions about the options available to you."
Is there a medication I can take for this H.pylori issue?,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacteria that commonly lives in the stomach. When this bacteria is present in the stomach, it can cause a whole range of medical issues and symptoms, most notably worsening <a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">acid reflux</a> as well as a predisposition to chronic inflammation of the stomach and even, sometimes, ulcers. 

Fortunately, there is excellent treatment available for H. pylori, which typically involves taking three or four medications at the same time, including an anti acid medication like Prilosec as well as antibiotics. This treatment is usually continued for a few weeks, at which point the bacteria is usually eradicated from the stomach. If the treatment is successful, most people do notice a considerable improvement in their acid reflux and other stomach symptoms.

I would recommend that you followup with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> about this positive H. pylori test result. They will be able to prescribe the medications for you that are necessary to get rid of the infection. Furthermore, they will be able to provide you with followup care after the treatment is over, as it is quite important to document that the symptoms are improving. 

Set up an appointment as soon as possible!"
"What causes pain moving through the GI tract, plus painful bowel movements?","I am sorry that you are having these issues! I strongly recommend that you see a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a> about this, if you have not done so already, because recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea can occasionally be a sign of a serious medical problem requiring treatment. You can start by seeing either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>. 

When you see your doctor, make sure to mention any specific additional symptoms which might help to narrow down the possibilities, especially fevers, joint pain or swelling, skin rashes, weight loss, blood in your bowel movements, or associations with particular foods. Your doctor will most likely want to perform some blood work and potentially also some stool tests to help figure out what is going on. 

If all of this workup turns out normal, then you may be suffering from a condition called irritable bowel syndrome, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of abdominal cramping associated with either constipation or diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome is strongly associated with increased levels of stress, and it is generally treated by paying attention to lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and sleep. Sometimes, however, medications are also used to alleviate or prevent recurrence of the symptoms. 

Talk to your doctor as soon as you can!"
What's wrong with my bowel movements?,"Blood in the bowel movements is a very concerning symptoms and it needs to be checked out right away by your primary care <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">doctor</a>. 

By far the most common cause of blood in the bowel movements are hemorrhoids, which are small, swollen veins that develop around the rectum and anus and that can bleed when irritated. Hemorrhoids should cause blood that sort of sits on top of the stool or that is noticeable on the toilet paper when you wipe, but the blood should not be actually mixed into the stool itself. 

Although hemorrhoids are not a very serious problem, intestinal bleeding as a cause of blood in the bowel movements is very serious. If you notice that the blood is mixed into the stools, or if your stools have turned blackish in color, then this is more concerning for intestinal bleeding and would require more immediate evaluation by your doctor. 

I suggest that you schedule a visit with your primary care doctor's office right away. In the meantime, if you start to experience very significant bloody bowel movements, or if you have any symptoms such as <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> or abdominal pain, these could be signs of a serious intestinal bleed, and you should go to your local emergency room for evaluation. "
I have chronic acid reflux. Is there a permanent cure for this problem?,"<a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">Acid reflux</a>, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common illness encountered in the primary care setting. The classic symptom of heartburn occurs as a result of the reflux of excess acid produced in the stomach up into the lower portion of the esophagus. When this occurs, irritation of the mucosal lining of the esophagus can occur, resulting in inflammation and pain. 

Fortunately, there are a variety of behavioral and medical interventions that are effective in treating this condition. Avoiding types of foods that provoke acid production can help, such as citrus fruits, tomato sauce, alcohol, soda and other acidic foods. As most people experience their worst symptoms in the morning (after laying flat all night), raising the head of the bed with a wedge or using an extra pillow can also be helpful. Avoiding late night meals and snacks can also help with morning symptoms. Weight loss has also been shown to be effective in curtailing symptoms. 

Medications known as proton pump inhibitors are very effective in reducing the production of stomach acid. These can be purchased either over-the-counter or with a prescription from your physician. These are some of the most commonly prescribed medications in this country. 

You should also talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this right away. If the usual conservative measures are not working to relieve your symptoms, then a referral to a specialist (i.e. <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>) can be made. "
What can cause chronic belching?,"Belching or burping is one way that the body gets rid of extra air in the stomach. This extra air can get into the stomach in one of two major ways. 

First, it can get there because of swallowing of extra air while eating or drinking. If this is the case for you, then the ""treatments"" include making sure to eat small meals slowly, to avoid swallowing air. It can also be helpful to avoid carbonated beverages (as you are) and chewing gum, which often leads to a great increase in swallowed air. 

Second, the extra air can get there because it is actually produced inside the intestines. This is very common, for example, with lactose intolerance, because ingestion of lactose containing products stimulates production of gas by bacteria in the intestines that feed off of the undigested lactose. Similarly, the belching may be a sign of uncontrolled GERD or celiac disease. 

I definitely recommend that you talk about this issue with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>, if you have one. The major priority is to rule out that the belching is from poor control of your underlying medical problems and, if so, to work on medications and diet modifications to improve the symptoms. "
Am I lactose intolerance?,"I am sorry to hear that you are continuing to have so many symptoms! It sounds like you have had a pretty good initial workup done, although there is still in my mind more thinking and investigation that should occur. 

In particular, I am curious by the statement that your ""intestines were inflamed"". This is definitely something that can be found on endoscopy, but it should not lead to a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is defined as <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> and cramping in the absence of any evidence of inflammation. There, I think it is important to clarify this point regarding the findings on upper endoscopy. 

If it turns out that there was indeed evidence of inflammation, then several other conditions would be compatible with that, including inflammatory bowel disease (aka Crohn's disease, not be be confused with IBS) and celiac disease (reaction to gluten). 

I think it is time to involve a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>, especially if you have not had any clear answers after so much initial testing. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should be able to make the referral for you. I hope that you get some answers to this issue very soon and that you can start feeling better. "
My mom is having sleep problems. What should be done?,"This sounds like a very unfortunate problem, and I am sorry to hear that this has been afflicting her for so long. The best thing to do is to have your mother evaluated by a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>. It is important to know what it is that is keeping her awake, not letting her sleep, or waking her up. Does she have other health problems that are interfering, or does the problem seem to be completely due to <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> and difficulty related to the previous stress? Is she overweight, and does she find herself waking up frequently due to needing to breathe, in a manner consistent with obstructive sleep apnea? Do you have any more clues to offer than what you have suggested so far? If it is simply that she is lying in bed but unable to fall asleep due to stress and anxiety, then it would be important for her to see someone about helping her overcome these feelings. These could also be a sign of a larger problem, as complaints such as depression will often affect sleep habits and should be reviewed. Regardless of what might be causing this <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>, please speak with a doctor -- or, rather, have your mother speak to a doctor -- to see what more can be done and what other clues your mother may offer. "
What can I do to treat obstructive sleep apnea and PTSD?,"This is an interesting suggestion, as obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> being linked to PTSD is not a common connection. Usually, PTSD is related to stressful events that have happened in the past. Two tours of duty are a likely source of this stress (and, on behalf of others, we thank you for your service!). While this can create many issues in the rest of your life, it would not usually be directly related to sleep apnea, at least the obstructive variant, so you should definitely speak with your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> about what may be causing this. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually caused by excessive soft tissues of the upper airway obstructing the airway while you sleep. As the muscles of the airway relax during sleep, the soft tissue falls into the airway and blocks it. This leads to a decrease in oxygenation, which causes the brain to wake the body up briefly to breathe. With increased muscle tone that comes with awakening, the air goes in and out of the lungs readily, fixing the problem. Typically, this problem is completely anatomic rather than mental. Fixing this problem comes either with a machine that puts pressure into the airway to splint, or hold open the soft tissue (like a BiPAP machine), or by surgically debulking some of the tissue. Please speak to your doctor about potential corrections, and perhaps visit an ENT <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> for more options. I hope you're feeling better soon, and good luck!"
What is restless leg syndrome?,"If you're concerned about Restless leg syndrome (RLS), I recommend that you discuss the issue with your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>. RLS is a neurologic disorder in which an individual feels the need / urge to move one's legs in order to prevent or stop uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations. Relief is gained by repositioning the legs, but this is only temporary, and the individual will need to repeat this action frequently. The sensation in the legs, which can be described as anything from a pain to an itch to a vague unpleasantness, tends to be most noticed during times of relaxation (such as while reading or lying in bed). The disorder tends to affect middle-aged and older adults the most. The exact cause of RLS cannot be determined for most patients. In some cases, RLS may be associated with the use of certain medications (such as anti-nausea and anti-depressant drugs) or damage to the peripheral nervous system (neuropathy) due to a variety of different diseases (such as diabetes). Some studies have suggested that iron deficiency may account for up to 20 percent of all cases of RLS, and thus the measurement of blood iron stores is generally recommended for all patients being evaluated for this condition. If you have any further questions about RLS, you and your wife should discuss them with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. "
What can I do to help me sleep?,"This sounds miserable! <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">Insomnia</a> can be very disrupting to one's quality of life, as it is hard to enjoy your daytime activities when you are excessively fatigued. Overall, since your insomnia is new, it would be best to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for an overall history and exam to make sure there's not a new issue with your health that could be contributing to your trouble sleeping. For example, patients with sleep apnea or other disorders may sometimes report insomnia.  

In general, promoting healthy sleep habits includes having a regular sleep routine (ie going to bed and getting up at consistent times from day to day), not spending time in bed or in your bedroom outside of sleeping, having dark shades (as necessary) to minimize light, avoiding eating or exercise before bed, and avoiding stimulants like caffeine several hours before sleeping. It sounds like you have tried several strategies without success, so you may want to talk to your physician about trying a sleeping aid. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits with your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> after a history and exam, but there are several options for pharmacologic management, including some medications such as Benadryl or trazodone with minimal side effects.

Book an appointment with your primary care doctor today! Good luck!"
What does it mean if when I'm sleeping I stop breathing and can't move?,"It sounds like the most likely thing here is that you are suffering from sleep paralysis. This is a condition in which the physiologic adaptations to deep dreaming sleep, which include complete relaxation of all of the muscles of the body, do not ""turn off"" prior to awakening. This is very terrifying, because the sensation is exactly that of not being able to move at all! However, generally speaking, the symptoms resolve on their own after a few seconds. 

In mild cases of sleep paralysis, usually it is enough just to know what is going on and that the condition is relatively benign and not something to be scared by. However, more persistent and severe cases should be investigated by a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sleep doctor</a>. This is because, sometimes, the condition is associated with narcolepsy or other sleep conditions which can be effectively treated. Also, occasionally, isolated severe sleep paralysis can be treated with medications, although the downside of treatment is that it involves suppression of deep dreaming sleep. 

You should start with a thorough medical check up by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. If they feel it is necessary, they can make the referral to a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a> for you. 

Good luck!"
How do I know if my sleep apnea diagnosis is definitive? ,"<a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">Sleep apnea</a> is a diagnosis that has a couple of different possible causes.  By far the most common cause of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea.  This occurs when tissue within the throat relaxes during sleep and causes an obstruction in the airway.  It typically occurs in people with larger necks sizes.  <a href=""/procedure/snoring-498"">Snoring</a> occurs when air moves through this obstructed region and therefore sometimes snoring can be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea.  Another type of sleep apnea called central sleep apnea occurs when the brain's respiratory center become less sensitive to blood carbon dioxide content during sleep.  This type of more rare, and more difficult to diagnose.  Both types of sleep apnea can be detected during a sleep study.  A sleep study can also be called polysomnography.  This study is the only study that can confirm the diagnosis of sleep apnea as it will detect the periods of time when you stop breathing.  I should also add that I would be shocked if they disqualified you from being a bone marrow donor just for sleep apnea.  Nevertheless, you should schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep medicine specialist</a> to get this sorted out.  He or she can perform the sleep study and tell you for sure whether or not you have sleep apnea.  Good luck.  "
Why did I wake up last night and not be able to breathe?,"The episode you describe sounds like it could be several things, including nocturnal <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> or possible <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a>.  Waking up short of breath in the middle of the night is definitely not a normal occurrence, so you should see your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> as soon as possible for a history and exam.  Your physician should be able to go over your symptoms in more detail and determine if additional testing is need to investigate a diagnosis of asthma, sleep apnea, or even something else based upon your exam.  Although asthma is most often associated as a disease of childhood, it can present in adults and it can present as nocturnal waking.  Your doctor will want to know if you had any wheezing, if anything made the shortness of breath get better, and if you have any other symptoms lately (sneezing, watery eyes, tightness in the chest).  Sleep apnea is growing more and more common in the United States and can be caused by several factors, including a large body habitus or excess soft tissue in the back of the throat.  People with sleep apnea will actually stop breathing for short periods of time which results in a drop in their oxygen levels.  This hypoxia causes the patient to start breathing again, but often in a gasp.  It could be that one of these 'gasps' woke you up.  It is important for your overall health to get to the bottom of what is causing this, so you should see your doctor right away!"
Do I need a CPAP machine if I have sleep apnea?,"Obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> is a very common and very dangerous condition if left untreated.  Basically it is caused by an obstruction of the airway caused by a relaxation of the muscles that keep the throat open.  This results in snoring and periods of time during sleep when breathing is stopped because of the blockage.  When this occurs, the person with sleep apnea wakes up for a brief moment.  This makes the quality of sleep low and results in a lot of daytime fatigue.  It is also associated with high blood pressure and heart disease.  The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine helps keep the airway open and prevents the periods where breathing is stopped.  CPAP is currently the best treatment we have for sleep apnea.  Other options which are considered if you fail CPAP include <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to remove the uvula, and in extreme cases tracheotomy.  Neither of these are options you will want to consider unless you absolutely hate the CPAP.  The other option you have is weight loss.  Some people that are overweight and have sleep apnea can improve their sleep apnea by returning to a normal weight.  If you aren't overweight, this is less likely to work.  The best physician for you to see about this problem is a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep medicine specialist</a>.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment to discuss this further.  "
Is it possible that my son has sleep apnea?,"<a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">Sleep apnea</a> is a very common problem in our society. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most prevalent type, and seems to be caused by excessive soft tissue in the airway. During the day, this does not cause any difficulty due to the tone of the muscles keeping the soft tissue pulled back and out of the way. At night, however, when the muscles relax and the patient lies on his back, all of the extra soft tissue seems to fall back and obstruct the path of air into the lungs. This causes low oxygen levels, which can cause problems over time. The body responds by sending a signal to the person causing them to wake up countless times through the night to take a deep breath in. That's why sleep apnea patients often seem to hold their breath and then gasp deeply for a minute of two. In older adults, it tends to be more common among those who snore and are overweight, although this is not always true. In children, it can be caused by other issues, including tonsils. The best step to take is to have your child evaluated by a physician who specializes in <a href=""/procedure/sleep-problems-117"">sleep problems</a>. "
What makes people snore?,"Snoring is a very common problem for many people. It occurs because, when you fall asleep, certain soft tissues and muscles inside your throat relax more than when you are awake. This allows them to vibrate when you breathe in and out, which causes the snoring noise. 

Sometimes, snoring is just related to your particular throat anatomy and is not a sign of any serious medical problem. However, most cases of severe snoring should be evaluated by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This is because there are several causes of snoring that are treatable and should be treated. 

First among these are nasal allergies or nasal congestion, which is a problem that your doctor can easily diagnose with a simple examination and for which excellent treatments are available. Similar, a deviated nasal septum, often caused by an old nose injury, can be surgically corrected. 

Next, <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> is a very common cause of snoring. This is more common in people who are overweight and have other chronic medical conditions. In sleep apnea, the airway actually completely closes off periodically while you are asleep, leading to 'gasping' and fatigue. This condition can be treated in more mild cases by <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, whereas more serious cases may require a device to assist with sleeping. 

Start by seeing your doctor today! "
How is sleep apnea treated?,"I am sorry that you have been experiencing these episodes during your sleep.  It must be frightening to awake with a choking sensation.  It is likely that you have sleep apnea.  You should follow up with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss your symptoms and possible management including referral to a sleep medicine specialist.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that involves the pause or decrease in airflow despite persistent breathing effort.  This can be associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and other sings of poor sleeping like snoring and restlessness.  The prevalence of OSA is about 20% in the general population, so it is a fairly common diagnosis.  This usually occurs because of a decrease in airway size while sleeping as the airway musculature relaxes.  So, while your brain is telling your body to take a breath, your airway has partial or complete collapse and does not allow air to pass.  Snoring and choking like episodes are attempts your body makes to keep your airway open.  

There are various different treatments for OSA ranging from machines that give you positive pressure while sleeping, called CPAP, which help keep your airway open to surgery.  Since there can be various components to the cause of OSA, you should follow up with your primary care physician for a full discussion of your symptoms, physical exam specifically looking at your tonsils and airway anatomy, and possible referral to either an <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">ear-nose-throat specialist</a> or a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a> for a possible sleep study."
Do doctors know what causes restless legs?,"<a href=""/procedure/restless-legs-syndrome-224"">Restless legs syndrome</a> is the term used to describe a sensation in which people are driven to be constantly moving their legs when otherwise quietly resting (such as in bed at night).  Notably, moving the legs relieves the discomfort and strange sensations.  We are not entirely sure what causes restless legs syndrome (RLS), but there are several conditions that have been linked to the disorder, including iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease (likely as a result of multiple electrolyte abnormalities), diabetes, <a href=""/procedure/multiple-sclerosis-234"">multiple sclerosis</a>, Parkinson's disease, rheumatic disease, venous insufficiency (where the veins of the legs don't provide adequate blood flow and drainage), and even pregnancy.  One of the first steps in evaluating restless legs syndrome is assessing the overall health situation to make sure that appropriate treatment is provided for any underlying condition that might be causing the restless legs.  In the case of patients with iron deficiency and RLS, the use of iron supplements can often result in dramatic improvement.

In addition, there are several medications that have been used to treat restless legs syndrome, including medications such as ativan, pain medications such as gabapentin or opioids, dopamine agonists such as those used to treat Parkinson's disease, and a medication called pramipexole.  

The best thing you can do to help treat your symptoms is to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away. He or she can do a more complete history to determine if you do have RLS. In addition, a history and physical examination will help identify any underlying causes of your symptoms as well as suggest what medications might work best for you. Hopefully your discomfort will be gone before too much longer!"
Can consuming too much sugar affect someone's sleep?,"Sugar may theoretically have some effects on sleep, depending on an individual's sensitivity to it. When you eat a lot of sugar right before bed, your blood sugar climbs high and then falls rapidly as your body releases hormones to bring the levels under control. This swing in hormones and blood sugar levels may impair sleep. In general, it is not a good idea to eat a large meal or a lot of calories (including sugar) right before bed for this reason. 

There are other things that can impair sleep even more than sugar. For example, if your sister eats a lot of chocolate, it is probably the caffeine and not the sugar that is the real problem. Caffeine is a stimulant and it impairs falling asleep. It is important to avoid chocolate, tea, coffee, and sodas before bed if you are having trouble falling asleep. 

Also, alcohol has major effects on sleep architecture and is one of the principle causes of waking up in the middle of the night after falling asleep. 

Your sister should take a look at her eating habits and lifestyle and, if she is still having trouble sleeping after making some basic changes, go see her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. "
Why can?t I sleep at night?,"<a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">Insomnia</a> is a very common complaint. Most people experience this on occasion. However, if there is continued and troublesome insomnia that is affecting your life -- this needs to be evaluated. I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as there many causes that can be potentially treated.

Sleeping pills are not recommended in general. While some work to transiently help you sleep -- they are simply ""covering up"" the problem. It may be appropriate to take them, but the important thing is to first figure out why you have insomnia. For this, I would recommend discussing this with your primary care doctor. If appropriate, he or she may prescribe you some sleeping pills.

As to what is causing it -- there are many causes. A big distinction is if you have trouble falling asleep or trouble staying asleep -- as the two types of insomnia have different causes. 

Some of the common causes include:1-depression ; 2- thyroid problems; 3-gastric reflux 4- urinary problems, 5- lung problems such as <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> and many more. However arguably the most common cause of insomnia is poor ""sleep hygiene."" This is a term used when people are setting themselves up to not sleep i.e. having bright lights on, napping in the day, eating/drinking before bed etc.

Talk to your doctor for more information."
Could I have a breathing problem as a side affect of rectal cream?,"If you are worrying about the rectal hemorrhoid cream interacting with your sleep apnea, then no, you don't need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a>. The rectal creams for hemorrhoids are pretty benign and they are not really absorbed into the system; they act locally to reduce inflammation in the hemorrhoids. Also, there is no medicine in the rectal cream that would be a problem for your sleep apnea or would cause your oxygen levels to drop. 

If you are noticing that your oxygen levels are dropping, or if you are feeling fatigued in the mornings consistent with sleep apnea, this should definitely be evaluated by your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sleep doctor</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. However, this wouldn't have anything to do with your treatment for hemorrhoids. 

It would be interesting to know if you are using a CPAP machine for your sleep apnea. Sometimes, the pressure settings on these machines need to be changed from time to time, and it may be that yours needs some adjusting or customizing. 

If you are not using CPAP despite having sleep apnea, it might be time to talk to your doctor about getting set up with that technology. It will greatly help your sleep patterns. "
Are snoring and sleep apnea the same thing?,"This is a very good question, and one that we get all the time in the ENT (Ears Nose Throat) clinic. The short answer is ""no"" they are not the same. In order to understand <a href=""/procedure/snoring-498"">snoring</a> and sleep apnea, you must first understand something about the anatomy of the upper airway. The airway from your larynx (voice box) to your lungs is relatively rigid (like a PVC pipe) and as such is relatively resistant to collapse. The airway from your larynx to your lips is more of a muscular tube. While you are awake it easily stays open because you have muscle tone. When you lie flat so gravity is working against you, and also lose muscle tone, the already slightly floppy upper airway becomes even more floppy. Snoring is the sound that is made when the upper airway tissues are flopping around during inspiration. Apnea is when things become so floppy that they actually collapse and completely obstruct the airway. After a few seconds (or many seconds in some cases) of obstruction, the blood oxygen levels start to go down. Your brain doesn't like not having enough oxygen, so it wakes you up, restores muscle tone, and you can breath again. Until you fall asleep and start the whole cycle all over again. Snoring doesn't have any significant medical risks, but sleep apnea definitely does. If you are a bad snorer, and you aren't sure if you have sleep apnea, I would recommend making an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, or a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a> (or even an ENT) to get examined, and have a sleep study ordered. I hope this helps, and I wish you all the best. "
Are there any natural remedies for insomnia?,"Sorry to hear that your sleep has been terrible for the past 6 months. There are definitely different ""natural"" ways to help promote healthy sleep habits. Sleep is something that has been greatly studied by science throughout the years. It can be broken down into two main groups: REM and NREM. REM sleep, or Rapid Eye Movement, accounts for only 20-25% of total sleep time in most adults. It is so named because of the eye movements that occur. A descending muscular atonia occurs (meaning that the muscles of the body can't move) during this stage of sleep, and this is the stage where most memorable dreaming occurs. Some theorize that the atonia occurs as a protective measure so that we don't act out our dreams. NREM (Non-REM) sleep is broken down further into N1, N2, and N3 sleep. A normal sleep pattern goes from N1 &gt; N2 &gt;N3 &gt; N2 &gt; REM. This pattern repeats throughout the night. N3 is referred to as ""deep"" sleep, and this occurs longer at the beginning of the sleep cycle, while REM gets progressively longer throughout the night. N1 sleep is usually where myoclonus or ""jerks"" occur while sleeping. The entire sleep cycle is controlled by your circadian clock (sleep/wakefulness cycle). This clock is controlled through temperature changes and different enzymes/neurotransmitters. Melatonin is typically released as part of this process and contributes to the cycle. I would recommend making an appointment with a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a> so that they can talk to/examine you, and possibly perform a PSG (polysomnogram, ""sleep"" study). They will help determine exactly what the sleep problem is, and what stage. They may also try starting something (other than sleeping pills) such as melatonin. I hope that this is helpful. "
Does snoring indicate a health problem?,"More and more <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctors</a> are considering <a href=""/procedure/snoring-498"">snoring</a> to be a significant health problem.  This is because snoring may be a sign of a health condition called obstructive sleep apnea (sometimes referred to as OSA for short).  Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the back of the throat relaxes and closes during sleep.  This causes an obstruction between your mouth and your lungs preventing air from getting in.  It is almost as if the throat is choking itself.  When air does get through, it causes a vibration within the throat that causes the sound you hear when someone snores.  While almost all people with obstructive sleep apnea snore, not everyone that snores has obstructive sleep apnea.  Thus, one cannot diagnose your boyfriend with this disease on the basis of snoring alone.  However, this symptom means that he should be tested.

I suggest that your boyfriend schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep medicine specialist</a>.  He or she will ask your boyfriend a series of questions, and possibly order a sleep study.  This will tell his doctor if he has obstructive sleep apnea.  In addition, you can discuss different methods of sleep and even some mouth pieces that can reduce the burden of snoring while he sleeps.  Good luck.  "
Why do I have insomnia?,"There are several possible causes for your <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>. It is certainly possible that not playing sports has something to do with it, as previously you may have relied on the exhaustion from playing hard to fall asleep. Now that you are not playing and have more energy, you may need to seek out alternative ways to get exercise. Even just 30 minutes a day of light aerobic exercise, such as jogging, should improve your sleep cycle. 

You should also look at whether you are taking any substances that could interfere with sleep. For example, if you drink a lot of coffee or soda, these are well known to interfere with sleep. You may want to try cutting these out entirely and see if this has an effect. 

Another possibility is that your sleep cycle has been messed up by irregular habits (for example, sleeping late and staying up late on the weekends but not during the weekdays). One helpful approach is to sleep the same on all days of the week, including weekends (for example, get up early every morning, go to bed at the same time every night). 

If these tips do not work, you should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a checkup and more suggestions. 
"
When should I use a sleep aid?,"I would recommend that you talk to your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>. Insomnia is a very common condition that we all experience at some point or another. While sleep aids can be helpful in some circumstances, they are not a great long term solution. Talking to your doctor about what other options are available and identifying the cause of your insomnia can help.

There are various causes of insomnia, and identifying a cause is often the first step in rectifying it. The biggest problem in people with insomnia is having poor sleep habits. By this we mean people who drink to much (caffiene or other drinks) beforehand, sleep with to much light, or other causes. These, if identified, can be rectified. Other medical conditions can also cause insomnia -- such as prostate problems (getting up to pee), reflux problems or heart problems. A significant cause of insomnia is also <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> or stress. Work with your doctor to identify the cause -- this can really help rectify your problem.

A sleep aid can be a short term <a href=""/procedure/bridge-17"">bridge</a> to help you rest while identifying the cause. IT IS NOT A GOOD LONG TERM SOLUTION. There are many over the counter solutions, but these rarely work compared to the prescriptions. Talk to your doctor for more information."
Can a different pillow solve my snoring issue?,"I doubt that a pillow will ""fix"" your <a href=""/procedure/snoring-498"">snoring</a>. When you think about your airway, in very basic terms from the voice box (larynx) down to the lungs it is relatively rigid (cartilaginous) and can't collapse easily. However your airway from your larynx to your lips is more like a muscular tube. When you are awake the muscle has tone and stays open easily. When you fall asleep that tube loses some of the muscle tone and becomes ""floppy"". The soft tissue flopping when you breath in is what causes the snoring sound. 

Sometimes this can be positional, and typically if it is, it is worse when lying supine because your tongue base will prolapse posteriorly with gravity and partially obstruct your airway making the issue worse. An important thing to discern is whether you have purely a snoring problem which is not detrimental to your health, or whether you have obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a>. 

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a similar problem of floppy tissue, except that your airway can totally collapse while sleeping causing your oxygen levels to drop which can have significant negative health affects over time. I would recommend that you see an ENT or a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a> to get evaluated and maybe get a sleep study. I hope this helps. "
Why do people snore when they sleep on their back?,"Snoring is a symptom of mechanical blockage of the airway.  When you fall asleep, the muscles of your tongue and throat relax.  If you are on your back, they ""slump"" backwards into your upper airway, partially blocking your air passages and leading to the loud vibrations we call snoring.  This is why snoring is typically improved by sleeping on the side or stomach.  

Overweight individuals are at higher risk for snoring because of the deposition of fatty tissues in the neck, which narrows the airway and contributes to these loud vibrations.  Things that you can do that will improve snoring include weight loss, side or stomach sleeping, and avoiding sedating medications or excessive alcohol intake.

Although snoring has historically been thought of as benign, there is emerging evidence that it can also be a symptom of a syndrome known as the ""obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> syndrome.""  This syndrome is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and snoring, and is due to disruption of sleep from transient, brief complete blockage of the airway.  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with higher rates of <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, heart disease, and stroke, and there are a number of therapies available that reduce the risk of these complications.  

If your boyfriend is having symptoms of poor concentration, excessive daytime sleepiness, nighttime choking, gasping, or smothering, you should seek a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> referral for a sleep apnea evaluation."
Will I be hooked up to a machine during my sleep study?,"<a href=""/procedure/sleep-studies-221"">Sleep studies</a> are performed for many reasons. One of the more common reasons to do them currently is to determine if you are awakening multiple times during the night, which can result from disorders such as obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> (OSA). During a sleep study, you will go to a hotel or other quiet room, and then be connected to quite a few wires and machines. 

Some of these will monitor your oxygenation, while others will monitor your brain activity. You might also be recorded and monitored in other ways as well, depending on the specific aims of the study. The information that can be gathered from a sleep study is important for many reasons. It is valuable for quantifying the amount of disturbance or type of sleep problem that might be affecting you. If you are considering interventions to improve your sleep, this quantification of the problem can be very important. 

This is especially true if you are considering surgery, as there are very specific recommendations. Most people tolerate the machinery and trouble of a sleep study very well. Please speak with your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>, who will be able to discuss any concerns that you may have, and address whether or not this test is needed for you. "
Do insomniacs benefit from sleep studies?,"Insomnia is a common problem and constitutes one of the most common patient complaints in primary care settings.  One study of patients visiting their <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> estimated that up to 69% of patients had insomnia.  Insomnia is defined as a pattern of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and being unable to re-initiate sleep, which is sufficient enough to cause difficulties with daytime function.  

For the majority of sufferers, insomnia is intermittent; but in a smaller group of patients it is a chronic problem, occurring more nights than not over a period of weeks to months.  The causes and classifications of insomnia are numerous.  Briefly, these are: Acute insomnia (short term insomnia related to an identifiable stressor or trigger), Inadequate sleep hygiene (insomnia related to patterns of behavior that are not conducive to initiation of sleep), Psychophysiological insomnia (insomnia related to psychiatric problems such as anxiety, worry, or racing thoughts, which become linked to sleep and which cause physiologic activation such as elevated heart rate or increased adrenaline, hindering the onset of sleep), Idiopathic insomnia (an uncommon and incompletely understood cause of lifelong chronic insomnia with onset in childhood, affecting about 1% of children),  Paradoxical insomnia (also called pseudoinsomnia, wherein patients complain of insomnia despite appropriate onset, durration, and quality of sleep; thought to be related to overestimation of sleep latency, underestimation of sleep duration, and increased metabolic rate and arrousal during sleep), and Insomnia due to a primary medical or psychiatric condition (such as <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a>, heart failure, neurologic disease, depression, or anxiety).  

There are also several neurologic and genetic diseases that primarily affect sleep, but these are very uncommon and beyond the scope of this question.  The most important tool in differentiating between the various causes of insomnia is a detailed history taken by a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a>.  Other important, non-invasive tools are various surveys and diagnostic questionnaires administered by a sleep specialist.  One of the most useful medical procedures for diagnosing insomnia is polysomnography, commonly known as a sleep study.  This test is useful for studying the onset of sleep, the timing and duration of sleep cycles, the physiologic changes occuring during sleep, and neurologic activity during sleep.  

I am not sure whether you are indicating that you are going to participate in sleep research or whether you are indicating that you are going to have a sleep study performed.  Regarding the former, depending on the type of research in which you may be participating, there may be the potential for some benefit to you, but this is hard to comment on without knowing more about the study.  If you are going to undergo a sleep study, this is purely a diagnostic procedure (which means there is no potential benefit to you, with the exception of more accurate diagnosis of your sleep disorder). 

However, once a sleep study is interpreted by a sleep specialist, that professional may be able to indicate what form of insomnia you have and suggest appropriate treatment.  In either case, if you have insomnia you should be seen by a physician, such as a sleep medicine specialist, so that serious causes of insomnia such as heart, lung, or neurologic disease can be ruled out."
Can sleep problems be corrected through therapy?,"Yes, there is such a thing as sleep therapy and it is often a very helpful tool to improve sleep in people with certain forms of insomnia!  There are several forms of insomnia in which sleep therapy is particularly beneficial.  

Many people who report trouble sleeping suffer from either poor sleep hygiene or from psychophysiological insomnia (AKA primary insomnia).  In poor sleep hygiene, patients have behaviors and practices in their daily life that are not conducive to the appropriate onset, duration, and quality of sleep.  These patients benefit greatly from sleep therapy, because one focus of this therapy is teaching behaviors and habits that are conducive to good quality sleep (called Sleep Hygiene).  In psychophysiological insomnia, patients have psychiatric disturbances such as <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, excessive worry, or racing thoughts which trigger a physiological response, such as increased heart rate or increased adrenaline, which hinders sleep onset.  

This type of insomnia is actually something of a vicious cycle, in that the anxiety and worry patients experience is usually generated by the insomnia itself, i.e. patients may toss and turn in bed anxious that tonight may be another miserable sleepless night and they may worry about how they will feel the following day after not sleeping well.  Over time, this anxiety and worry becomes tightly linked with sleep and eventually the psychiatric and physiologic disturbances generated by these behaviors become the very barrier that consistently prevents healthy restorative sleep.  

In sleep therapy, cognitive and behavioral psychological approaches are used to help patients identify and control these maladaptive thoughts and behaviors that are barriers to healthy sleep.  The combination of education on good sleep hygiene, eduction of relaxation methods, and cognitive behavioral therapy is often very effective in giving most patients with insomnia the tools they need to improve their sleep as much as possible.  

For many patients, sleep therapy is even more effective than medications and is substantially safer and more practical over the long term.  If you have trouble sleeping, I would recommend making an appointment with a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a>, who can evaluate your <a href=""/procedure/sleep-problems-117"">sleep problems</a> and recommend the most effective treatment for you."
Do people with restless leg syndrome move their legs in their sleep?,"Restless leg syndrome is a increasingly recognized condition in which patients feel an extreme sensation of vague discomfort in their legs and an uncontrollable need to move their legs. Upon moving or stretching of the legs, the uncomfortable sensation goes away. Usually the symptoms are worse towards the end of the day and especially at night. 

Some cases of restless leg syndrome can be accompanied by jerking movements of the legs while asleep. These jerking movements may or may not be disturbing to the patient. 

Restless leg syndrome can be either primary, meaning that we do not know the exact cause of it, and secondary, meaning it is related to another underlying condition such as diabetes, <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>, kidney disease, and the like. 

Although it does sound like your husband moves his legs quite frequently, what is not clear from your question is whether this bothers him, interferes with normal activities, or is associated with an uncomfortable sensation in the legs. If the answer to these questions is no, then this is much less likely to be restless leg syndrome. 

If, however, you are concerned about the possibility that your husband has this condition, then you should start by describing these symptoms to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. "
What do doctors look for during a narcolepsy evaluation?,"Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder which has the principle characteristic of excessive <a href=""/procedure/daytime-sleepiness-222"">daytime sleepiness</a>.  People that suffer from narcolepsy often fall asleep during the day.  These episodes of sleep often come at in-opportune times.  Sometimes people will fall asleep while driving, while sitting at the dinner table, or while working.  Narcolepsy is often associated with a different syndrome called cataplexy.  Cataplexy is the sudden loss of muscle tone (often causing someone to collapse) that is triggered by an emotional state (often laughter).  

During a <a href=""/procedure/narcolepsy-evaluation-1028"">narcolepsy evaluation</a>, a physician that specializes in sleep will ask you questions about your symptoms and perform a thorough physical exam.  Often the diagnosis of narcolepsy is apparent just with this simple evaluation.  If there is any question about the diagnosis, the <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> will administer a sleep study and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).

Narcolepsy is thought to be a disease that is genetically based, though there is still much to learn about it's cause.  For now, I must say that we do not know exactly what triggers it.

If you have symptoms that sound like narcolepsy, then I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a pulmonary doctor that specializes in sleep.  The two of you can discuss you symptoms and can proceed with a workup and treatment ASAP."
How is a narcolepsy evaluation performed?,"A narcolepsy evaluation is typically done in a doctor's office, not inside a hospital.  The disease rarely requires hospitalization.  I will explain.

Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.  This causes a person to fall asleep very often during inappropriate times during a day and sometimes suddenly.  Narcolepsy can, and is often associated with another syndrome called cataplexy.  This is a sudden loss of muscular tone brought on by an emotional trigger often laughing.  If you have ever seen someone fall to the ground after laughing, this is cataplexy.

Often times narcolepsy is diagnosed by history.  In other words is someone comes to the doctor and says I'm falling asleep 10 times per day and I lose my muscle tone when I laugh, then this is enough to make the diagnosis.  A sleep study or multiple sleep latency test can help if the diagnosis is not certain.  Both of these tests can be done as an outpatient and do not require hospitalization.

I suggest that if you are concerned that you have narcolepsy, that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a>.  This is a pulmonary doctor (<a href=""/pulmonologists"">lung doctor</a>) that has done extra training in sleep.  He or she will be able to listen to your story and perform the appropriate testing to get you a diagnosis and treatment.  "
Does drinking warm milk before bed help insomnia?,"Many people will suffer from <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a> at some point in their life.  Insomnia is defined as the inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or just sleep of poor quality.  Insomnia can be a symptom of other sleep, medical and psychiatric disorders so it is important to see your primary care provider to discuss your symptoms and appropriate treatment plan.

There are many things you can do to help with your insomnia.  Your mother was right that drinking warm milk before bed can help you sleep.  This is because milk contains tryptophan, which is an amino acid which helps induce sleep.  Turkey and tuna fish also contain tryptophan.  Also many people find the ritual of drinking a warm glass of milk a calming ritual that helps them wind down to sleep.  

Other things that you can do to avoid another restless night include no caffeine after 2pm, going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday, exercise (but not in the 2 hours before bed), keep electronics out of the bedroom (no TV or smartphone), and if you can't fall asleep after 30 minutes of lying in bed get up and do something else and then try again in 30 minutes.  "
Is getting up frequently a sign of insomnia?,"There could be several causes of your sleep disturbance, and I recommend that you make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss this issue. 

The most common cause of <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>, or sleep disturbance, is probably stress and other psychological or emotional factors. If you are currently undergoing a lot of stress or if there have been major changes in your life, these factors could cause changes in your sleep. You can talk to your primary care doctor about this and, in addition to thinking about ways to reduce the stress in your life, you may want to talk to a counselor or <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> as well. 

Another major cause of trouble sleeping is the ingestion of caffeine or other stimulants. You may want to try stopping all caffeine intake, especially in the afternoons and evenings and see if that makes a difference. 

Similarly, alcohol severely disrupts sleep. Although some people find that alcohol makes them drowsy and helps them get to sleep, it prevents good deep sleep later in the night, resulting in awakening and feeling fatigued the following morning. 

Start by talking to your doctor. They will help you determine if further workup of this problem is needed if a cause cannot easily be identified. "
Do homeopathic therapies work?,"Homeopathic therapies are commonly used by numerous people throughout the country and throughout the world. They work for some and don't work for others. Regardless, <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a> is a serious condition. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to have this evaluated and hopefully treated.

Firstly, insomnia is a common condition. There are many different causes that can be treated, often without medicine. For example, many people have caffeine prior to sleep or are exposed to to much light prior to sleep that makes it difficult to sleep. Avoiding these and improving sleep habits can help. I would recommend talking to your doctor as there are many ways to improve your problem. In addition, there are some serious causes of insomnia that should be ruled out.

To answer your broader question, yes homeopathic therapies work some of the time. Some of the time they don't. The fundamental problem with these types of medicines is that they are not studied like others. As such, we can not conclusively say they work, don't work and can't confidently know what the side effects might be. As such, as a medical doctor I do not recommend them.

Talk to your doctor about insomnia as well as any potential new medicine (homeopathic or otherwise) might take."
Can aromatherapy help me get to sleep faster?,"<a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">Insomnia</a> is a very difficult condition to treat, but it is good to know that there are many therapies and methods that can be used to help. Aromatherapy, to my knowledge, is not a method that has been rigorously studied. This means that it might or might not work. The fortunate part of the idea is that there is really no down side to attempting aromatherapy in your specific situation, to see if it does help you to sleep better. 

If it does not work, you haven't lost anything except a few dollars in purchasing the necessary supplies. For most people with insomnia, the best place to start is with adjusting your sleep hygiene. This means avoiding caffeine, exercise, alcohol, and stimulating activities such as TV right before you go to bed. It also means laying in bed for no more than 20 minutes before trying something to calm you down (such as reading a book) before trying to sleep again. If you have tried all of these methods and continue to suffer from insomnia, then you should speak to a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sleep doctor</a>. He or she will be able to recommend further interventions, including the possibility of medications. "
Why am I constantly exhausted and sleepy?,"While it's not possible to establish a diagnosis without a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a>'s visit, there are a few things that come to mind.  You should take these into consideration when talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor.

Many things can cause you to be sleepy and have a lack of energy.  Many of the most common of these things you have described already - hypothyroidism, depression, poor sleep hygiene, stress, and anemia.  Another very common reason for being sleepy is sleep that is disrupted by blockages in your airway while you sleep, called Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  Things like being overweight and snoring loudly can suggest this diagnosis, but it can be found even in people without these risk factors.  To diagnose obstructive sleep apnea requires a sleep study, where you sleep in the hospital and are observed overnight.

Another possibility is that you have an infection that is making you tired.  Infectious mononucleosis, a disease caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus and referred to commonly as ""mono"", or many other viral infections can be associated with fatigue after infection which may last for months.  There are blood tests that can suggest this diagnosis in the appropriate patient.

Finally, there is a syndrome of unclear cause called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disease of excessive fatigue which is typically diagnosed only after other causes of excessive sleepiness are ruled-out.  There are doctors who specialize in the treatment of this syndrome, using techniques like cognitive-behavioral therapy.

I hope you find these suggestions useful.  Again, it is not possible to establish a diagnosis without seeing you in person, but it sounds as though you have had a reasonable workup for many of the common causes of excessive fatigue.  You should talk to your primary care doctor about these possibilities, to determine what further diagnostic steps might be useful and what therapies could be tried."
How much melatonin is safe for occasional insomnia?,"<a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">Insomnia</a> is a common problem, and I am glad to hear that you are taking the most important measures already (such as avoiding caffeine, etc). There are additional measures that might be beneficial in your situation, and your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be able to discuss these with you in more detail, which might allow you to avoid medications altogether. 

If your melatonin is providing symptom relief for you, then this might be a good option. While there are no known complications with this medication, there is not a large amount of evidence regarding the long term use, although it is generally considered to be relatively safe. The maximum and recommended dose should be indicated on the box of the product that you are purchasing. In general, a dose of 0.5 to 10mg taken at night is recommended. 

Your brain actually secretes this hormone as well, as it is responsible for regulating your sleep/wake cycle to some degree. It can be valuable for some people who are seeking to recover quickly from jet lag as well, but should, like all medications, be used in consultation with your physician who knows your personal medical history and situation and can advise accordingly. "
Why is my wife so twitchy?,"Random motor movements can be a sign of a serious medical condition, the result of a previous injury or <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>, or they can be annoying but harmless effects of nerve and muscle interaction. To be sure which of these your wife is suffering from would require more information, including a visit to her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or possibly a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> for more information, a physical exam, and a review of her past medical history including her family and birth history as well. If she also complains about unpleasant sensations such as tingling at the same time, then it is possible that she has a medical condition such as restless leg syndrome (aka RLS). 

Otherwise, some small segment of the population will have these spontaneous movements of their extremities, and they are generally not related to anything significant. There are some medications that can cause residual effects that persist long after the medication has been discontinued as well, and it is possible that your wife is having this sort of effect. If you remain concerned, notice that her symptoms are becoming more pronounced, or she has other symptoms, it would be worth speaking to your primary care doctor or a neurologist in more detail. "
What are the dangers associated with heavy snoring and sleep apnea?,"There have been many studies conducted that have looked at the effects of obstructive <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a> (OSA) on the adult population. When compared to matched individuals that do not suffer from OSA, patients are more likely to have increases in weight gain and <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>. It has also been shown that OSA can lead to symptoms of daytime fatigue, as OSA interrupts the normal amount of deep sleep the body needs to recharge at night. As a result of this process, patients are at risk of falling asleep at random times during the day, including while driving. 

Fortunately, there are treatments that exist for OSA. You should talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> about your concerns. You can be referred for an outpatient sleep study, where you can sleep and have different values monitored, such as heart rate, breathing rate, pauses in breathing, brain activity, oxygen levels, and blood pressure. If you are diagnosed with OSA, you can be fitted with a breathing mask or nasal device which can deliver positive-pressure air at a continuous rate and help you overcome the difficulties caused by your sleep apnea."
Why do I have trouble falling asleep?,"In the young adult population, stress or anxiety is an often-diagnosed cause of <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>. If you feel stressed out as a result of school or work or can't stop worrying about your daily routine or tasks that need to be completed, then this can certainly translate into difficulty sleeping. If this is the case, then finding healthy ways to cope with your stressors can help lead to better sleep. 

It is also important to consider the effects of any external substances on sleep; one such substance is caffeine. Even a cup of coffee in the early afternoon can cause the mind to race when it is time to sleep. Cigarettes can have the same effect as nicotine is a stimulant to the body. 

You should certainly talk to your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> about the <a href=""/procedure/sleep-problems-117"">sleep problems</a> you are having. You are correct in that Ambien is not a recommended long-term solution in most cases. If stress or anxiety is a problem, then your doctor can help address these issues with either counseling or other types of targeted medication. "
Why have I had a hard time falling asleep recently?  ,"The list of causes of <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>, or difficulty falling or staying asleep, is long and diverse. In general, it is advised that all people practice good sleep hygiene. This encompasses a set of recommendations to maximize the amount of healthy sleep a person can achieve. Some of these ideas include setting a regular time for going to sleep and getting up in the morning, avoiding shifting your sleep times on weekends, avoiding all caffeine in the afternoon or evenings, avoiding late night meals or snacks, and minimizing the use of television and music in the bedroom prior to sleep. If you are having any issues with stress or feel like your mind is racing when you lie down at night, you should try to find healthy ways of coping with your stressors.

If you follow these lifestyle modifications and are still having difficulty staying asleep, you should talk with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> through your school's health services center. You can come up with a plan of treatment which can include counseling and/or the use of medication to get your sleep pattern back to normal."
"Why do I wake up in the middle of the night, but am unable to move? ","Sleep is a puzzle that has vexed <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctors</a> and scientists for many years.  Although we spend approximately 30% of our lives sleeping, we are still unsure of its exact role in human neurophysiology.  We know that there are different sleep states that we cycle through at night as we sleep.  The most important distinction is between REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep.  Non-REM sleep has multiple phases, from light to very deep sleep. 

In general, dreaming does not occur during non-REM sleep, with the exception of nightmares, which are thought to occur in the deepest stages of non-REM sleep.  In non-REM sleep, most physiologic processes are greatly reduced, so it is thought to be important for helping some of the processes of the brain and body ""reboot"".  REM sleep is different, it is a light sleep state that we enter into several times a night where the brain is very active.  During REM sleep, vivid dreaming occurs while our eyes move rapidly and our muscle movement is inhibited (to prevent us from acting out our dreams).  As infants we spend &gt;50% of the night in REM, however as we age we eventually plateau at about 25% REM sleep per night.  That observation has lead some to believe that REM sleep and the process of dreaming are important for learning and integrating new memories.

There are several derangements of sleep that cause people to wake up frequently at night.  The most common and the most important to rule out is sleep apnea.  In obstructive sleep apnea the musculature of the throat relaxes at night and weight of the tissues of the neck (especially in obese persons) causes reversible airway obstruction.  This causes the person to stop breathing and briefly wake up throughout the night.  This is a treatable but potentially serious illness that must be ruled out at a follow up visit with a sleep medicine or pulmonary physician.  

However, you indicated that when you wake up at night you cannot move, and this is actually more consistent with another condition called sleep paralysis.  This is actually a very common and benign disorder of REM sleep.  Because the brain is as active in REM sleep as it is during waking life, the brain must induce paralysis of the muscles to keep us from acting out every action we make in our dreams.  To do this the brain essentially puts up a neurochemical ""gate"" in the brainstem to keep signals from getting to the peripheral nerves.  But sometimes things go wrong...  REM is also a very light sleep state, so we can easily wake up from it (and we remember our dreams only when we do so).  Most of the time we simply wake up, remember our dreams and move on.  But in some people the line between REM sleep and waking life is initially blurred.  The consciousness can actually wake up in isolation, causing the processes of waking life to be mixed with the processes of dreaming.  When this happens to an individual, they will wake up at night, typically they will be unable to move or even speak, and they will sometimes have frightening hallucinations.  This can go on for up to a minute or two until the consciousness fully takes hold of the brain and we move into waking life.  It is a fascinating phenomenon that is so common that many cultures have created mythologies to explain this strange and occasionally terrifying state.  Fortunately, although sleep paralysis can be a very frightening experience, it otherwise has no negative neurologic or physiologic repercussions.

Finally, a much less likely explanation could be a form of epilepsy called a partial seizure, where abnormal activity occurs in any given brain region, with a very wide variety of effects.  It is conceivable that a partial seizure in the right region of the brain could produce these symptoms, but this would typically be something that occurs during waking life as well.  Although this would be a fairly unlikely explanation of such symptoms, it is not impossible, especially if you have ever experienced these symptoms during the day.  Only a visit to a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> could rule this out for sure.

You must follow up with a sleep medicine physician, <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>, or neurologist in person.  Only examination and testing by one of these types of physicians can rule out serious conditions like sleep apnea or epilepsy and truly determine why you are waking up at night unable to move."
Are there any major interactions between doxepin and alcohol?,"You are correct in your concern for interactions between alcohol and doxepin.  The specific concern is just as you have mentioned: <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

CNS depression can have many symptoms, but the most common are an increased sense of sleepiness or drowsiness.  Effects seen at higher doses can be difficulty walking or slurred speech.  Dangerous side effects at higher doses are respiratory depression, which can lead to stopping breathing (typically after falling asleep), coma or death.  The likelihood of these medications producing a dangerous interaction increase with the dose, so the more you drink the more likely you are to have these effects, as well as with other medications or substances which also produce CNS depression.  The doses of doxepin typically used for <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a> are lower than the doses used for other reasons, but in general, patients taking doxepin are not advised to drink any alcohol.  You should definitely consult with your <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">doctor</a> prior to taking any other medication, and although it is not advisable to drink any alcohol at all, should you choose to do so, you should do so with great caution and avoid any compromising situations (i.e. driving, operating machinery, swimming).

Of note, among the other potential side effects of doxepin is an FDA ""black box"" warning about suicidal ideation.  While rare, there is a documented association of doxepin and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  Should you find yourself thinking of causing harm to yourself or others at any point, you should contact your doctor or an emergency medical service (either by phone or by going to the emergency room) immediately."
Can invisalign correct overbite?,"The best way to determine if your particular dental problems can be corrected orthodontically with the <a href=""/procedure/invisalign-consultation-52"">invisalign</a> <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">braces</a> is to make a consultation visit with an <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a>.  He or she will need to do a thorough dental exam to determine exactly which teeth need to be repositioned and whether or not there is sufficient room in your mouth to do so without causing crowding issues.  The decision about which type of correction to use will also depend on your specific exam.  In many cases, invisalign technology can be used to correct a typical overbite.  Hopefully, this will be the case for you!  However, it is also possible that your orthodontist may also feel the need to use a combination of metal braces and invisalign, depending upon the degree of correction required.  The only way to find this out is to go in for an exam.  In addition, it may be worth it for you to consult with more than one orthodontist.  It is possible that some practitioners may have different approaches they would take to correct your bite, and before you commit to the time and expense of any kind of correction, it is important for you to feel comfortable with your orthodontist and his or her approach."
Is it normal to feel worse after starting an antibiotic?,"You should discuss this problem with the <a href=""/orthodontists"">doctor</a> who performed your procedure. Antibiotics, like all medications, can cause people to experience adverse side effects. These effects can include, but are not limited to, allergic reactions (which can range from mild to life-threatening), nausea, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, and constipation. Erythromycin in particular has been known to cause diarrhea given its effects as a pro-motility agent in speeding up the gastrointestinal tract. That being said, isolated mouth pain seems like an unusual and/or uncommon side effect of any medication. Given the fact that you had a <a href=""/procedure/root-canal-15"">root canal</a> done recently, your symptoms may be more attributable to the actual procedure than the medication. The procedure may have caused some residual inflammation in the surrounding tissue, or may have been complicated by a subsequent infection that is not being treated by erythromycin. 

It is advised that you talk to the doctor who performed your procedure about the symptoms that are you are currently experiencing. He or she can perform an appropriate history and physical exam, and rule out any dangerous underlying causes such as infection. He/she can also discuss with you the use of alternate medication to get your pain under control, since the hydrocodone does not seem to be working adequately. "
How do they fix your jaw if it is misaligned?,"This depends a great deal on what exactly is going on with your jaw. Generally the first step in an evaluation of a misaligned jaw would start with an <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a>. This is because most causes of jaw misalignment involve mismatch of the teeth on the top and bottom (""overbite""), and all except the most severe cases of teeth mismatch can usually be corrected with braces, one of the areas of treatment that an orthodontist specializes in. 

Some cases of jaw misalignment are also due to muscle spasm or strain or irritation of the temporomandibular joint (the joint near your ear where the jaw attaches to the head). These cases can also usually be diagnosed by your orthodontist, who may recommend initial simple treatments such as physical therapy, relaxation exercises, and anti inflammatory medications. 

In the most severe cases of jaw alignment, it may be necessary to cut the jaw bone and move it into a new position. These surgeries are typically performed by either an <a href=""/oral-surgeons"">oral surgeon</a> or a plastic surgeon. Your orthodontist is the best person to help you decide whether or not surgery might be indicated and, if so, to coordinate a referral for you to a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgical specialist</a>. Please speak to him or her soon."
Is my jaw pain from wisdom teeth?,"Jaw pain can come from many different sources, and one of them is the eruption of 3rd molars (wisdom teeth) or the crowding that they can cause. While you are within the appropriate age range for this to be the cause, there are other causes which could possibly be more common. If you feel that you are constantly under large amounts of stress, it is quite possible that you are grinding your teeth (bruxism, as it is called by doctors and dentists) and that this is leading to some soreness in your jaw. This soreness can contribute to or even be the same as another syndrome known as Temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction syndrome, or TMJ. This is essentially inflammation of one of the joints of your jaw, and is very common. It can usually be treated conservatively with good results (conservative treatment meaning exercises, rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, etc). At times, either for bruxism or for TMJ, a bite block can be helpful to reduce the symptoms. There are obviously many other reasons that you can be having jaw pain, and if it continues you should see a health professional, either your <a href=""/orthodontists"">doctor</a> (likely an ENT aka <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">otolaryngologist</a>) or your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. "
Why does my jaw hurt?,"The jaw is quite a complicated part of your anatomy being formed by two joints (the temporomandibular joints) and several muscles. Pain in the jaw is referred to as temporomandibular disorders or TMD.  There are many possible causes of <a href=""/procedure/jaw-pain-508"">jaw pain</a> and pain in the jaw can be associated with headache, neck pain, and/or clicking or popping noises when opening or shutting the jaw.  It is important to have a thorough exam by either a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to help determine the cause of your pain and prescribe appropriate treatment. X-rays may or may not be needed depending on your other symptoms and your exam. It is possible that your jaw or ""bite"" is not in line which over time can cause pain.  Overuse injuries are common as well, caused by either chewing gum, clenching the jaw from stress, and grinding your teeth during sleep.  Jaw pain can also be caused by a sinus infection.  Another common cause of jaw pain is a toothache or periodontal disease.  Make an appointment to determine the correct cause of your pain, but in the meantime try icing your jaw, avoiding overuse of your jaw, and taking an over the counter pain medication."
Why is there a clicking sound in my jaw?,"Jaw clicking is a very common symptom of temporomandibular joint syndrome. This joint is what connects the mandible and the skull. It is generally affected by various conditions that can affect any other joint in the body including <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, or trauma or dislocation. 
There are many symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. These symptoms may include, as in your case, a clicking or popping sound in the jaw during biting, opening or closing the mouth. There may even be a headache, migraines, neck pain, shoulder pain or even ear pain. There are many causes for why this maybe happening to you. A very common cause is teeth grinding, that can happen at night, known as bruxism. In addition, habits such as excess jaw opening or closing (i.e. chewing gum, large foot bites) may be responsible as well. 
You should make an appointment to see a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> to discuss this with your dentist. Your dentist will be able to perform a detailed history of your symptoms, do a thorough physical examination, and explain the causes for your symptoms. Based on your history, your <a href=""/orthodontists"">doctor</a> will be able to provide treatment, and suggest strategies to prevent this from happening to you again. "
What are the symptoms of mouth cancer?,"There are several reasons why it is important for you to seek dental consultation as soon as possible. Most concerning of these is your chronic tobacco use and a new finding of a patch that seems to have been present for sometime now. 

There are several symptoms of oral cancer. Most commonly, oral cancer presents as a lump, bump, sore, patch or a crusty lesion on the lip or within the mouth or at the gums. Sometimes there may also be bleeding from these sores, a change in the function of your jaw, change in voice, ear pain and sometimes unrelated symptoms of <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> or change in appetite. 

The most common risk factor for the development of oral cancer is a history of smoking, especially in male gender. Smokers are six times more likely than nonsmokers to develop oral cancer. A family history of the same, and alcohol use are also additional risk factors. 

Because of the above mentioned, I would advise you to seek dental opinion as soon as possible. A <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> will be able to visually examine your mouth, take a detailed history during your routine examination as part of <a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">cancer screening</a>. In addition, he or she may also perform biopsies of suspicious appearing lesions. These tests maybe needed to detect oral cancer sooner than when the disease has progressed to provide appropriate treatment
"
Can you break your chin without knowing it?,"To answer your question -- yes -- a break in the chin bone or mandible is a very possible cause of your pain. That being said, there are other causes of chin pain that should be evaluated. I would recommend that you see your primary <a href=""/orthodontists"">doctor</a> to have this evaluated. 

A trauma to chin can cause damage to many different structures in the area. A possibility is trauma to the bone -- or a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> as you suggest. The mandible is actually a very strong bone -- so a complete break might be less likely. That being said a partial break or crack could have occurred. Talk to your doctor about this -- he or she can evaluate this with an x-ray.

There are other structures that could have been damaged. The soft tissue or muscles in the area can be damaged by the trauma. This results in inflammation and swelling which can take weeks to heal and improve. There can also be damage to the skin which can cause pain. Rarely, these openings in the skin can get infected -- known as cellulitis. This can cause worsening pain.

Talk to your doctor. Evaluating the cause of pain is important. After knowing what the cause of the pain is, your doctor can prescribe treatment for the pain. Good luck!"
What is causing the popping sound in my jaw?,"Generally, a popping sound in your jaw is due to a displacement of the joint that connects your lower jaw to the rest of your skull, known as the temporomandibular joint or TMJ. the symptoms of a TMJ disorder can vary from person to person. Most commonly experienced symptoms may include a clicking or a popping jaw, earaches, headaches or migraines, shoulder or neck pain and difficulty with moving or opening the mouth or difficulty chewing. The most common reason to seek medical attention is generally pain, which can be quite debilitating. 
There are many causes of why this could be occurring. Most commonly implicated reason is teeth grinding that often occurs at night. Other causes include excess chewing, trauma, bone disease. 
It is advisable to seek medical attention and see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to diagnose what could be causing this problem. A doctor could adequately discuss your clinical situation and easily diagnose this with simple physical examination, and sometimes imaging maybe required. Your doctor can also help with measures to relieve the pain as well as suggest some relaxation techniques. I would therefore suggest seeing your primary care doctor to discuss your problem, as well as to seek some treatment for the pain that you may been having. "
How long will it be before I know if my jaw surgery worked?,"Sorry to hear that you needed orthognathic <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to fix your jaw. I am also sorry to hear that you feel like 6 months after your surgery your jaw still isn't feeling quite ""normal"". Since I don't have your medical records to know exactly what your pre-surgical X-rays look like, and exactly what was done surgically, it is hard for me to give you information as to what your post-op course should be. If your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> had to move the bone of your jaw significantly, they likely had to cut the bone (osteotomies) and move it into the new position. Then using plates and screws it is held in its new position while the bone heals. Depending on how much they had to move it it will usually heal in a couple (2-3) months. The healing of the bone can be confirmed post-operatively with X-rays which some surgeons choose to do. Aside from the healing of the bone, there can also be a significant amount of soft tissue swelling which, pending on the extent of the surgery, can take a long time to resolve. This may be affecting your bite, or how your jaw ""feels"". However I would recommend having this discussion with your surgeon. If you don't think that you are comfortable discussing this with your surgeon, they it is perfectly reasonable to seek out a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> from an Oral-Maxillofacial Surgeon (OMFS). I wish you all the best and hope that your jaw improves. "
What happens if I stop wearing my retainer?,"Congratulations on having your <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">braces</a> removed.  It can occasionally be difficult to always remember to wear your retainer but it is necessary to keep your teeth in the same alignment for many years after having your braces removed.  You should follow up with your <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a> to evaluate your teeth and to help obtain a replacement retainer.

Unfortunately, once your braces are off, if you do not use a retainer on a regular basis, in most cases your teeth will shift and move out of alignment.  There are a few unusual cases when patients do not experience changes in their teeth despite not wearing their retainer, but this is rare.  Because of the fact that teeth will move after braces removal, many orthodontists will place a small metal wire on the inside surface of the bottom teeth to help keep the teeth aligned without the daily use of a retainer.  However, even this wire is not always perfect.  

If you want to keep your teeth straight, especially this soon after having your braces removed, you should obtain a replacement retainer. Many patients need to get touch up work and treatment when they are older because their teeth have moved as a result of not wearing <a href=""/procedure/retainer-installation-70"">retainers</a>.  You should follow up with your orthodontist to discuss your teeth and the best management for you case."
Should I have an orthodontic consultation if I want to have my teeth replaced?,"Dental health is important to your overall health.  An <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a> is a specially trained <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> who does procedures and surgeries of the mouth, jaw and teeth.  It would be very appropriate to see an orthodontist to have dental work such as dental implants or dentures.  Dental implants are artificial tooth roots that are used to support a restoration for a missing tooth or teeth.  Dentures (or false teeth) are prosthetic devices constructed to replace missing teeth and most are removable.  If your teeth are healthy but crooked you may need braces, which an orthodontist would also take care of.  

Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to get a recommendation for a board-certified orthodontist.  Go with a list of questions such as what would be covered by your insurance, how much time you'd have to take off work, and what your limitations will be after the procedure.  It is also important to practice good dental hygiene to ward off further problems with your teeth and gums.  Make sure that you are seeing a dentist at least twice a year for a thorough exam, x-rays, and cleaning.  "
Is an orthodontic consultation good for someone who is about to get braces?,"Dental braces are devices used to help align and straighten teeth as well as helping position them in regards to a person's bite.  Braces can be either cosmetic or structural.  Orthodontists are specially trained dentists and they are the type of <a href=""/orthodontists"">doctors</a> who you see when your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> tells you you need braces.  

I would recommend talking to your dentist as well as friends and family members to get a recommendation for a board certified <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a> in your area with a good reputation.  At your consultation the orthodontist will examine your teeth and mouth and likely take x-rays (or look at ones you had done elsewhere) and discuss what he or she feels is the best treatment plan for you.  There are different types of braces and depending on the reason for your need for braces the length of time that you will need to have them on varies greatly.  Make sure to discuss how long you will need to have them on and also if you will need retainers afterwards.  

It is also important to discuss cost and possible insurance coverage as braces can be very expensive.  Make sure that the orthodontist you see for a consultation answers all your questions and makes you feel comfortable.  Good luck!"
Will people still be able to see my invisalign braces?,"Dental <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">braces</a> are devices used to help align and straighten teeth as well as position them with regard to your bite.  <a href=""/procedure/invisalign-consultation-52"">Invisalign</a> is a series of clear, removable teeth straighteners that are a relatively new alternative to traditional metal dental braces.  One of the clear advantages to Invisalign braces is cosmetic.  The devices are completely transparent which make them much less obvious to detect then traditional metal braces.  

It is almost impossible to tell from a distance that you have anything in your teeth but if someone were to take a very close look at your mouth they might be able to tell that you are wearing them.  Another advantage to these type of braces is that many feel they are more comfortable.  A disadvantage to some who wear Invisalign braces is that they must be removed before eating and drinking (except water).  So if you plan to try to keep your braces as discreet as possible you will have to keep this into consideration when eating with other people.  The success of Invisalign braces depends on you.  You must wear them for a minimum of 20-22 hours a day for them to be able to work effectively. Be sure to talk to your <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a> for more information."
Is it normal for the heart to skip a beat during exercise?,"The feeling of the heart skipping a beat can be very distressing.  The feeling of a skipped heart beat can mean several different things and it is not always an actual skipped beat.  The best type of physician to see for this type of problem is a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>.  

Interestingly, skipped heart beats are not felt, however pauses in the hearts rhythm will cause the beat after the pause to be greater in intensity.  This causes the feeling of your heart jumping which is perceived as a skipped beat.  This feeling can come during strenuous exercise and may be a normal sensation in your case.  However, premature ventricular contractions, abnormal heart beats that feels like skipped beats can be dangerous.  Exercise can sometimes unmask heart disease that was otherwise not apparent.  

I suggest you get seen for this soon.  In order to determine what is going on, you will likely need an electrocardiogram (EKG) done.  If nothing is seen on the EKG, then you may need longer term heart monitoring in the form of a Holter monitor that can be worn outside the <a href=""/cardiac-electrophysiologists"">doctor</a>'s office.  This way your doctor can see what your heart is doing while you are doing your daily activities.  This should be able to tell you whether you are having any skipped beats.  "
What can I do about an abscess after having my wisdom teeth pulled?,"It is always perfectly acceptable to go see another medical professional if you have concerns about the care you are receiving. However, I suspect that your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> would respond well if you just explained the concerns you are having. It is unlikely that she is not thinking about what is going on in your cases; rather, it may just be that she did not explain her thinking to you in sufficient enough detail, and that should be something that you can resolve with another conversation. 

She can also confirm whether or not this is really an abscess, or whether it is just swelling or an enlarged lymph node, which might be expected after a wisdom <a href=""/procedure/tooth-extraction-182"">tooth extraction</a>, and would not necessarily be unexpected. 

Of course, if you are feeling very unwell, especially if you have worsening pain or fever, then these are signs that something is not right, and you should seek immediate medical attention, either in an emergency room, or from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. In either one of these settings, you will be able to have confirmed whether or not there is an infection going on and, if so, whether it is being adequately treated by the antibiotics you are currently taking. Book an appointment today."
Why are my teeth becoming loose?,"Dental problems can be very upsetting, especially because one's smile and dental hygiene are so readily visible.  There are several things you can do to promote good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing.  In addition, it is also important to visit your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> for regular exams and cleanings.  In this case, the best thing you can do is make an appointment with your dentist right away for an evaluation.  He or she can examine your teeth and gums and discuss your symptoms in more detail.  It will be important to know if you are having any other systemic symptoms, as some vitamin or mineral deficiencies can manifest with tooth or gum problems.  If you have <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> gums in addition to loose teeth this could also suggest that you are not eating a diet with sufficient fruits and vegetables. Your dentist will also likely want to know about any prior dental care or procedures.  It will be important for you to also alert your dentist to any prior medical problems as well as what medications you take on a regular basis.  Hopefully with prompt attention you can ensure a lifetime of good oral hygiene and healthy teeth and gums!  Depending upon the results of your examination, your dentist may also consider consulting with other dental specialists. Book an appointment today!"
What should I do if my permanent crown is not feeling right?,"You should definitely see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> right away! Crowns are inconvenient necessities that arise when a tooth is ""too far gone"" and needs a permanent fix. It has the advantage over removal of a tooth, but, as you are finding, they have their own set of complications. A permanent <a href=""/procedure/crown-403"">crown</a> should be a near perfect fit, and should cause neither pain nor looseness. If you have either of these conditions, see your dentist quickly! He or she may need to repair or remove it completely and repeat the process. It is also quite possible that you are simply feeling the subtle differences between a tooth that you had all of your life and a near perfect, but slightly different, model. No model, no matter how well done, will be a perfect fit. That being said, it should be close and should not cause you pain. If there is a problem that was caused by an imperfect fit the first time, this may need to be corrected. If it has been done in the recent past, most reputable dentists will offer to do this free of charge. Regardless of what the problem may be, please see your dentist or get a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> in the near future before your problem becomes worse."
What is a dental bridge?,"The exact answer to your question depends a bit on what your tooth anatomy is like. You should talk with your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> to get a precise answer to your question. 

In general, a dental <a href=""/procedure/bridge-17"">bridge</a> is an appliance that is used to ""fill in"" gaps in the teeth, usually from loss of one or more teeth. In the most common form of a dental bridge, the teeth on either side of the gap are converted to crowns (teeth that are trimmed down and capped with a porcelain tooth replacement). The gap is then filled in with a third false tooth that is essentially cemented to the crowns on either side. The benefits of this are cosmetic, as they improve the smile by <a href=""/procedure/filling-14"">filling</a> in the previous gap between the teeth. Since this type of bridge is cemented in, there is no need to remove it at any point. 

There are other types of bridges that are more complete, for example in the case that the teeth on either side of the gap are also not in good shape or are not candidates for crowns, but your dentist will be able to discuss those options with you if they are relevant to your case. "
What is the difference between full upper dentures versus implants?,"Both are quite different, so I recommend discussing your options with your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. Briefly, <a href=""/procedure/dentures-19"">dentures</a> (or false teeth) would replace any teeth that have been removed previously or should be removed due to disease. Full dentures are different than partial dentures, in that full upper dentures would mean that all of your upper (maxillary) teeth have been removed. A partial denture would mean that only some of your teeth have been removed, and there are some false teeth that fit around those that remain. An implant is just what is implied by the name: something that is implanted into your jaw. This is obviously a more involved procedure, as it sometimes takes work to build up the bone to be strong enough to hold a new implant. To the base that is implanted into the bone of your jaw, false teeth can be added that do not slide and come out as readily as dentures, and feel more natural to some. The differences between the two are many, but implants are usually more expensive but feel more natural if done correctly. Dentures need to be cleaned more regularly and, over time, can wear down the bone of the jaw. Please speak to your dentist, and consider a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a>."
What is the procedure for replacing crowns?,"Tooth pain can be very unpleasant, so your husband should definitely see his <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> as soon as possible for an evaluation.  As you indicated, sometimes crowns do need to be replaced.  Depending on how old they are and when they were constructed, crowns can wear out and cause significant pain.  In general, in order to assess a <a href=""/procedure/crown-403"">crown</a>, a dentist will need to do an exam of the mouth and look at the margins of the gum line and the crown itself.  X-rays may or may not be needed to identify if there is decay underneath the crown.  Then, the process of making a new crown is very similar to the process of making the first one.  The crown can be gently removed.  There may or may not be decay underneath that needs to be removed.  An impression will be taken of the remnants of the tooth so that the dentist can then craft a crown that will fit the tooth and fit into the jawline with the other teeth.  A temporary crown will be placed over the tooth to protect it for about 2 weeks while the new crown is being constructed.  When it is available, the new crown will be cemented into place and hopefully all symptoms will be gone! Start by encouraging your husband to book an appointment with his dentist today!"
What is the painful bump that developed on my gums after tooth extraction?,"I'd recommend calling or going in to see the oral <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who performed your surgery to remove the teeth in the first place. They will be able to take a look inside your mouth to make sure things are healing up as they should be and that there are no complications. 

After the extraction of a wisdom tooth, there is a pretty substantial cavity that is left in the jaw. This takes a while to fill in and heal over, and sometimes the newly regenerating tissue that is <a href=""/procedure/filling-14"">filling</a> in the cavity can be very delicate and sensitive. This might explain the ""bump"" that you have noticed. Also, small nerve roots may be damaged when the extraction is performed, which could explain some of the sensitivity you are feeling in the surrounding teeth. 

All of that being said, however, it is important to rule out an infection, as you wish to do, as well as other complications such as persistent bruising or failure to heal over properly. 

Your surgeon can help you decide whether or not everything is proceeding as expected, or if it might be necessary to treat the symptoms that you are having.

Do all the top teeth need to be completely removed for immediate dentures?,"This is a question that only your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> will be completely able to answer for you, so I recommend making an appointment to be evaluated as soon as you can. 

Basically, it is common to remove all teeth from the area where the denture will sit. Leaving tooth fragments under this area is a bad idea, because it causes pressure and pain from the denture plate pressing on the teeth. Even small fractured teeth can be a problem under the denture plate, and so they are typically all removed. 

However, it is not always necessary to use a complete denture. For example, sometimes teeth on one or both sides of the area where the denture is needed are still in good shape. In this case, your dentist might advise getting a partial denture, which would preserve these good teeth on either side. However, teeth underneath the area of the denture would still need to be removed. 

Your dentist will be able to give you more specific advice about how many teeth will need to be removed and what the next steps after <a href=""/procedure/tooth-extraction-182"">tooth extraction</a> will be for getting your denture fitted! Make an appointment today, and good luck!"
I pulled my tooth out a few months ago and today it just started bleeding - why?,"It sounds from the information you provided that you may have tried removing the tooth yourself. This is not generally a good idea, because it can be difficult sometimes to remove the tooth entirely. This is especially the case if the tooth is falling out because of a bad cavity, as this tends to hollow out the tooth inside making it fragile and predispose to small pieces breaking off. 

I would, therefore, recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> as soon as you can. They will be able to take a look at the spot where you removed the tooth to see how it is healing and investigate the source of the <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. If there is a fragment of tooth still stuck in the socket, which I think is quite likely, then they will be able to help remove it. This can be tricky, depending on how small or how deep the fragment of tooth is, and they may want x-rays to better localize any remaining fragments before proceeding. 

In the future, if you ever have problems with other teeth, make sure to see your dentist in a timely fashion, rather than taking care of the problem yourself! Make an appointment with your dentist today."
Can a black spot on my tongue be dangerous?,"I would definitely have this checked out by your primary care doctor, especially since it has been present for quite a while and is not going away. If you can not get in to see your primary care doctor quickly, another option would be to see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>, as they are usually well trained to recognize and diagnose a wide range of conditions involving the mouth and tongue. 

The main medical issue that needs to be ruled out is that this spot on your tongue represents some form of cancer or precancerous spot. Both oral cancers as well as melanomas can occur on the mouth and in the tongue and need to be ruled out. After taking a look, if your doctor is concerned, they will probably want to refer you to an oral <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> for a biopsy of the area. This will involve removing a small piece of tissue from the spot (or removing the spot entirely) and sending it to a <a href=""/pathologists"">pathologist</a> for review under a microscope. The microscopic analysis will help determine whether any cancerous cells are present or not.

Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can!"
Is it possible to remove dark spots on my tongue?,"There are several different medical causes of dark spots on the tongue that need to be investigated before attributing this to tasting hot foods, which doesn't typically cause discoloration of the tongue. Therefore, I would recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. You could also see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>, as dentists are typically trained to identify a wide range of problems with the mouth and tongue. 

One possibility is something known as ""hairy tongue"" which can be triggered in the setting of tobacco use, poor oral hygiene, or inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Often it will clear up when these problems are rectified. 

Another concerning possibility that would need to be ruled out is a cancer of the tongue. Both oral cancers and also melanoma can present as dark spots on the tongue. If your doctor is concerned about the possibility of a cancer or precancerous spot after performing a physical examination, they will want to order a biopsy. A biopsy involves removing a small piece of tissue and sending it for microscopic examination by a <a href=""/pathologists"">pathologist</a>, who will be able to rule out cancer as the cause. 

Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can!"
Is it possible to fix a cavity near an inlay/onlay without removing them?,"This is a tough question to answer generally, because I think it all depends on exactly where the cavity is, how large it is, etc. For example a small cavity that is not directly next to the inlay may be fixable. However, if the cavity undermines the inlay in anyway, then the inlay will probably need to be removed. 

The only way to be certain about what needs to be done is to make a visit to your dentist. They can examine the cavity and may perform x-rays to get a better sense of the health of the tooth beneath the inlay. This information will allow them to answer your question directly. 

One thing that is for certain is that you should not delay your trip to the dentist! Cavities, if they are not fixed, tend to enlarge slowly over time. If the cavity does not undermine the inlay now, it may do so in the future if you wait without repairing it. The longer you wait, the more likely that the repair will be more difficult and more costly.

"My jaw has been locking, popping, and cracking. What's wrong with it?","I'm sorry to hear about these disturbing symptoms that you are having! It sounds like you are most likely dealing with a case of temporo mandibular joint dysfunction (commonly called ""TMJ""). The temporo mandibular joint is the joint that connects the jaw bone to the face. The joint is located right underneath the ear, which is where most of your symptoms seem to be localized. 

I do agree with you that seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>, is the next best step. Most of the time TMJ is caused by inflammation and irritation inside the joint space. This is commonly a dental problem, triggered by grinding of the teeth, or misalignment of the teeth and the bite. As such, it is often treated with splints or other strategies to help with jaw alignment, and your dentist will be an expert on these kinds of treatments. At the same time, anti inflammatory medications may be needed to help reduce the pain, and physical therapy is often also prescribed to help get you back to functioning normally again. In the more severe cases, referral to a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> might be needed for a more invasive treatment. 

Start by keeping the appointment you have already set up with your doctor!"
My jaw is popping more frequent and recently getting more severe. Why?,"I would definitely seek medical help for this problem! It sounds like you are probably suffering from temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Talking your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> is the best place to start seeking help for this problem. 

Temporomandibular joint disorder is caused generally be inflammation and wear-and-tear to the joint that acts as a hinge between your jaw and your skull. This joint is located right behind your ear, which is probably where you are feeling most of the pain and discomfort. 

There are several different causes of temporomandibular joint disorder, but most of them are related to trouble with the teeth. For example, habitual grinding of the teeth (a common night time disorder) can lead to the problem. Severe overbite or misalignment of the teeth can also cause this problem. For these, reasons temporamandibular joint disorder is often managed or picked up initially by a dentist. 

Treatments for temporomandibular joint disorder can be as simple as anti-inflammatory medications in more simple cases. However, more complex cases may require splinting of the teeth or other dental procedures (to improve misalignment) or joint injections (to directly reduce inflammation).

"
What is the cause of my bad breath?,"Sorting out the causes of bad breath often requires the help of both your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> and your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. You should discuss this question with your healthcare providers.

First of all, bad breath is often caused by tooth decay or other dental problems, such as gingivitis (inflammation of the gums). It sounds like you are already suspecting this, as you notice the smell more strongly when you are flossing your teeth. Your dentist will be able to take a look inside your mouth at all of your teeth and also your gum line. If they identify any decaying tooth, infection, or other dental problem, they will be able to provide you with recommendation as to how to proceed. 

On the other hand, if your dentist doesn't identify any issues, then your primary care doctor should be able to help. There are several medical problems that can cause bad breath. These include infection or chronic inflammation in the tonsils and chronic nasal allergies or sinus congestion. Furthermore, certain foods as well as smoking can be associated with chronic bad breath. Your primary care doctor can identify most of these potential causes with a quick physical examination. Based on what they discover, they can recommend the most appropriate treatment. Good luck!"
Canker sores - what to do?,"Canker sores can be very painful!  The exact cause of canker sores is not entirely certain, although several different factors including stress, certain spicy/acidic foods, or vitamin deficiencies can be associated with them.  They are also associated with some autoimmune or gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease.

Canker sores typically resolve within a week or so, although aggravating factors such as spicy foods or mechanical trauma can make them take longer to heal.  The fact that your canker sores have persisted for over 3 weeks is an indication that you should return for evaluation with either your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or your oral <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>.  It is possible that instead of canker sores you have a viral infection (a so-called 'cold sore').  It is also possible that you may have developed a small infection near your initial canker sore.  In either case it is important to be evaluated again so that your dentist can make sure nothing has changed since the initial exam.  With persistent canker sores, sometimes antibacterial rinses or steroid creams can help them heal.  In addition, there are also some topical medications that can be used to help with the pain and discomfort, particularly if this is giving you a hard time with eating. Good luck, and please see your <a href=""/dentists"">doctor</a> soon."
How long does it take for bones to stop adjusting after having teeth pulled for dentures?,"There definitely shouldn't be a sensation of ""bones popping up"" when you put in your <a href=""/procedure/dentures-19"">dentures</a>. After the teeth are pulled out of the sockets, there should be any residual bone there to pop up. Often there is some swelling and tenderness where the teeth are extracted and that should subside after a few weeks. If you are wearing dentures over swollen gums, that could definitely cause some discomfort. However, if you feel bone fragments popping through, then that could mean that a tooth fragment was not fully extracted when your teeth were pulled, and that would be something you would need to have looked at. 

I would suggest that you go to see the <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> who fitted you for the dentures. They will be able to look inside your mouth to see if there are any tooth fragments that need to be pulled. Alternatively, if they find any evidence that the dentures are just rubbing against and irritating the underlying gums, that might mean that the dentures do not fit properly and they may need to be adjusted. 

Regardless of what is going on, start by making a call to your dentist and setting up an appointment at your earliest convenience. "
Why do I have black spots under my tongue?,"I definitely recommend that you go see a doctor about this issue as soon as possible! Dark spots under the tongue could be concerning for a form of cancer, and the fact that you smoke may also be relevant, as it can raise your risk for certain types of cancer. 

The first thing I think of when I hear about dark spots is melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer caused by the pigment cells that give skin its color. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the surface of the body, including in the mouth. Other types of skin cancer can also occur in the mouth, such as squamous cell cancer, and these are more common in people who smoke. 

I would go see either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. Either one should be able to take a look at these spots and help determine whether or not they need to be investigated more closely. If they are concerned about the possibility of cancer, they will need to refer you to an oral <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, or an ENT doctor, who will be able to remove the spots with a biopsy to make sure that they are not cancer.

Do I need to worry about bumps on my gums after having teeth pulled for dentures?,"Getting teeth pulled is a traumatic procedure, and there is typically some swelling and inflammation at the site where the teeth are pulled out. Also, as the cavity left by the tooth fills in, there may be a residual bump as the tissue matures and heals. Generally speaking, what you are describing therefore sounds like normal changes that you would see after tooth extractions. 

However, I would definitely recommend that you follow up with your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> about this issue. Most likely they have already given you a follow up appointment date, and you should keep that appointment. If not, I recommend that you schedule an appointment with your dentist now.

Your dentist will monitor the healing in your mouth after the tooth extractions. When they feel that the swelling has decreased and the healing progressed satisfactorily, they will begin the process of fitting you for <a href=""/procedure/dentures-19"">dentures</a>. It is important not to rush this process, both so that you can have good fitting dentures and also to make sure that the gum tissue that the dentures will sit on is ready for the added stress of having the dentures rubbing on it. 

Again, please discuss with your dentist!"
Why are my gums turning brown?,"There are a few different potential causes for your gums turning brown. 

First, it could be that this is a normal finding for you. It turns out that, as people age, the color of their gums also sometimes changes, particularly in certain ethnicities. This is not, generally, a serious medical problem or a sign of an underlying condition, as long as the teeth themselves and the gum line near the teeth are healthy. 

Gum discoloration can also occur when there are tooth infections or when their is gingivitis (inflammation or infection of the gum line). However, this doesn't seem likely in your case, because you specifically mention that your actual gum line is health and that you have an active dental hygiene regimen. 

Finally, gum darkening may be caused by ingesting certain food stuffs, especially lots of coffee or tea. Smoking also can darken the gums. 

I recommend that you mention this issue to your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They can take a close look and make sure there is no evidence of tooth infection or gingivitis, or of any other condition that would require treatment or further medical evaluation. 

Good luck!"
Why does my jaw hurt off and on?,"I suggest that you go see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. It sounds like the pain is mostly in the teeth, and there are several different potential causes of the pain. Your dentist or doctor can help sort this out for you. 

One possibility that needs to be ruled out right away, especially if you have not been to a dentist in a while, is that this tooth pain is from a cavity or other condition affecting the integrity of the tooth enamel. Catching cavities early and fixing them is important, both to prevent and relieve to pain, but also to keep the teeth health and avoid more expensive dental procedures down the road. 

Also, you mention your wisdom teeth, and it is possible that the pain in your lower jaw is from overcrowding of your teeth from wisdom teeth coming in. Your dentist can take a look in your mouth for any evidence of this. If you do have tooth crowding, of course, you will need to eventually schedule an appointment with an oral <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> to have the teeth extracted. 

Call your doctor or dentist and set up a visit as soon as you can, and good luck!"
Can I lose feeling temporarily or permenantly in my face after a wisdom tooth extraction? ,"Although wisdom tooth <a href=""/procedure/extraction-of-eggs-1286"">extraction</a> is a very common procedure, it is important to remember that it is a surgical procedure. Therefore, as with any surgical procedure, there are various complications that can occur, and you should absolutely talk with your dental <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> about these various complications prior to having the procedure done. 

The roots of the lower wisdom teeth do pass very close to the main sensory nerves to the jaw. Although great care is taken by your surgeon when removing the teeth, occasionally some damage to these nerves does occur. Most of the time, this damage is temporary and will generally get better over a few weeks to months. However, in some rare cases, the damage may be permanent. 

Damage to the nerves after wisdom tooth extraction generally causes of sensation of numbness in the tongue or lower jaw. If this occurs, sometimes it can be cleared up quickly by reducing inflammation around the nerve, through taking anti inflammatory medications prescribed by your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. However, sometimes time is needed to allow the nerve to heal itself. 

Again, please talk with the dental surgeon who will be performing this procedure."
Are growth hormones for tooth tissue dangerous?,"Grafting of soft tissue is a very common procedure that is done by dentists with specialized training in the technique on a regular basis. The procedure is usually done for cases of bad gingivitis, or gum disease, where the gum lining close to the teeth has been eroded away, causing decay or pain in the teeth. A successful grafting procedure can both improve the appearance of the teeth and gums and, more importantly, help protect the teeth from further decay and potential loss. 

As part of the grafting procedure, some dentists apply some local protein hormones directly to the grafting tissue. This is done in order to promote the success of the procedure and the healthy growth of the grafted tissue. Since the growth promoting substances are applied directly to the grafted tissue, there is very little absorption into the bloodstream and, as such, the side effects and risk from this part of the procedure are negligible. 

I would suggest that, prior to having the procedure performed, you sit down with your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> to make sure that all of your questions about the procedure and about the recovery process after the procedure have been answered to your satisfaction.

Good luck! "
Why are my teeth turning black?,"I think that the color change in your teeth is most likely related to your smoking. Smoking involves exposing the teeth and the mouth to many different chemicals, some of which can react with the teeth and produce a variety of color changes, from yellow to dark brown. 

I would recommend that you schedule a visit with your regular <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> to discuss the issue. They will be able to examine your teeth to confirm whether or not this is in fact what is going on. If so, obviously, the main treatment will be trying to quit or cut back on smoking, if you can. Your teeth will probably also benefit from a professional cleaning, which your dentist's office will be able to do for you. In some cases, a whitening product might be recommended, although these often are not very effective if you continue to smoke. 

Also your dentist can make sure that the discoloration is not due to a more serious problem, such as a cavity or erosion of the protective hard covering of the teeth. If so, this will require more intensive intervention both to get rid of the color and also to protect the teeth from further decay. 

Please see your dentist as soon as you can. "
Is it best to wait until gums are healed after the extractions?,"I am sorry to hear that you had to have all of your teeth removed; however, it does sound like you have found a good <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>! I would strongly suggest that you continue to follow up with this dentist and that you follow his recommendation on how to proceed with fitting for <a href=""/procedure/dentures-19"">dentures</a>. 

I do understand that it is not fun to walk around in public without teeth. However, right after you have your teeth extracted, there is a lot of swelling in the mouth and the gums. If you try to fit the dentures over this swollen tissue, there is a risk that, down the road, the dentures will no longer fit well as the swelling goes down. Also dentures can be a bit irritating to the underlying gum tissue at first, so it is best to have that tissue well healed before placing the dentures on top of it. 

Your dentist will follow you closely and will be able to tell you when your gums have healed sufficiently and when the swelling has gone down enough to proceed with fitting for dentures. Keep discussing your situation with him, and ask him if you have questions. Good luck!"
What happens if you are on prednisone and have to get dentures?,"This is a question to discuss with your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. You are definitely correct that prednisone and other steroid medications like prednisone do have the effect of delaying the body's natural healing process. This is usually more of a problem with large surgeries and not such much of a problem with small procedures such as having teeth pulled. 

However, this exact effect will depend on how much prednisone you are taking and for how long you have been taking it. Therefore, I strongly recommend that, before the procedure, you make sure to talk to your dentist about the fact that you are on prednisone. You should also mention any other medications that you are taking and any medical problems that you have. This information will help your dentist decide what the potential risks associated with the teeth extractions will be and, based on this, they will be able to help you decide how to proceed. I suspect that a small chronic dose of prednisone will not prevent having the extractions but, if there are many extractions to perform, your dentist may decide to perform them in stages to give plenty of time for recovery and healing. 

Set up an appointment with your dentist at your earliest convenience to get your questions answered, and good luck!"
What kind of doctor should I see for TMJ?,"The temporo mandibular joint, or TMJ, is as you know the joint where the lower jaw bone connects to the skull. Temporo mandibular <a href=""/procedure/joint-pain-1023"">joint pain</a> syndrome is a very common medical problem, and symptoms typically include pain in the joint, especially with chewing. There may also be trouble opening the mouth wide in more severe cases. 

TMJ pain syndrome is most often picked up and evaluated initially by your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>. Therefore, this would be a good place to start for a consultation, if you haven't seen any <a href=""/dentists"">doctors</a> yet at all. The reason that dentists are so involved in the treatment of TMJ pain syndrome is that most of the causes of the problem related to the mechanics of the teeth and the jaw. For example, over biting in the mouth or misalignment of the teeth of the upper and lower jaw is the most common cause of TMJ pain. Similarly, grinding of the teeth, which most often occurs at night, is also associated with TMJ pain. Your dentist will be able to evaluate you for these causes and, if they find something, they will be able to recommend various treatments, which could include anti inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or bite guards. Please see your dentists soon."
Can you have surgery to fix TMJ?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having such trouble with your TMJ. This is a very common problem in which the temporomandibular joint becomes inflamed and painful, leading to trouble opening the mouth, chewing, and the like. Usually, inflammation of the joint is due to an overuse or strain <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, most of the time from misalignment of the teeth or from grinding of the teeth. 

This is one of the reasons that your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> has given you a bite guard, as this is supposed to help correct the alignment of the jaw and reduce some of the strain on the joint, allowing it to heal. You will need to discuss this issue with your dentist, to see how long they recommend you use the bite guard before deciding it is not working. Often, you need to give it a good trial of several weeks to month to know whether or not it is going to do the trick. 

Sometimes, in the most severe cases of TMJ, <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> is needed to directly correct jaw alignment. However, this is a major procedure, and typically it is avoided until all other simpler and less invasive measures have been tried and have failed. Again, please see your dentist soon!"
Is ridge augmentation possible at my age?,"One of the common findings that people who have worn <a href=""/procedure/dentures-19"">dentures</a> for a long time will experience is regression of the bone of the mandible. This usually will develop over time, and can eventually become painful due to the pressure that is applied to the nerves that innervate the lower parts of the jaw. After a time, dentures become difficult to use, and many people are very restricted in their diet, and also suffer the social, cosmetic, and psychological complications of not having teeth. There have been attempts to augment the lower jaw using various techniques, the majority of which attempt to increase the bone height and strength by encouraging the growth of new bone, often with implants or transplantation. Obviously, these surgeries can be very involved, and it is important to understand what the long term prognosis would be. Your age (77), would not necessarily be a contraindication to the surgery for many <a href=""/dentists"">dentists</a> or oral maxillo-facial surgeons, but it would be important to meet with one that you trust and come to understand what the surgery will entail. Obtaining a second opinion can also be valuable when you are considering elective surgery. Please speak to your dentist or <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. "
Is there any way to make the pain caused by TMJ go away?,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects your jaw to your skull, right in front of your ear. It frequently becomes inflamed, causing the temporomandibular joint pain syndrome, which is characterized by pain, especially with chewing or opening the mouth. 

Temporomandibular joint pain syndrome is essentially an overuse injury of the joint. As such in can be improved by resting the joint and by taking anti inflammatory joints like ibuprofen or naproxen. Additionally, in many cases, physical therapy and relaxation exercises are very effective. These are things that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, in addition to your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>, can help you with. Therefore if you feel like you need  a second opinion, you could go to see your primary care doctor about the issue. 

In severe cases of temporomandibular joint pain, especially when they are associated with misalignment of the teeth or grinding of the teeth, then a bite guard or dental braces may be needed. In the most severe cases, <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> on the joint or to realign the jaw may be needed. 

However, I would start by exploring the more simple measures like pain medications and physical therapy; talk with your dentist or your primary care doctor about these options. "
Is it safe to have surgery if I was recently sick?,"Generally speaking, it is best not to undergo surgery with anesthesia if you are currently ill, because this sometimes increases the risk of having a complication from the surgery or from the anesthesia. However, if your symptoms from your recent viral infection are all gone now, then this is not likely to be a barrier to proceeding with the surgery. 

However, you will need to talk to the dental <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who is going to perform the procedure, or the <a href=""/anesthesiologists"">anesthesiologist</a> who will be assisting with the procedure. Ultimately, the decision to proceed with the surgery depends on them, and they could decide to proceed or not to proceed based on whether they feel that you still are not completely over the illness and also based on your personal medical history, which may put you at higher or lower baseline risk. 

Make an appointment to see your <a href=""/dentists"">doctor</a> as soon as possible, or give their office a call right away. You can then explain to them your situation and you should be able to get an answer from them as to whether or not they wish to proceed. 

Good luck, and I hope that your procedure goes smoothly and that you recover quickly!"
Did I crack something in my jaw?,"The popping or cracking noise that you felt probably involved popping of the temporomandibular joint, which is the joint that connects your jaw to your skull, right in front of your ear. This joint can be strained, typically from chewing too hard. Most of the time, the pain that you experiencing will settle down if you rest the jaw (avoid chewing hard foods). However, it would be best to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> as soon as possible for an evaluation, especially if the pain persists. This is because sometimes the inflammation in the joint can be severe enough that it requires more aggressive therapy, which might include anti inflammatory medications or physical therapy. 

If you have any pain that is located directly in your teeth, rather than in the joint where your jaw connects to your skull, another possibility would be that you might have cracked or otherwise damaged a tooth when chewing. This is obviously a problem that would require a different type of treatment. Your dentist could evaluate your teeth for you, if you think this might be a possibility, and help you decide whether any additional treatment is needed. 

See your doctor at your earliest convenience!"
Do I have a gum disease?,"You should definitely go to see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> about this issue. Although it is common to have a small amount of 'wiggle' in the teeth, this should be very minimal and should not be really very noticeable at all. Therefore, if you feel like your teeth are significantly loose, you need to get this checked out as soon as possible. 

One common cause of this symptom is in fact gum disease, also known as gingivitis. Gingivitis occurs when the gums at the base of the teeth become inflamed, usually from bacteria and food debris that collects between the gum and the tooth. Over time, this inflammation can be progressive, leading to receding of the gums from the teeth, which can make the teeth lose or damaged. Gingivitis is usually treated with a good <a href=""/procedure/dental-cleaning-11"">dental cleaning</a> and continued oral hygiene with regular brushing and flossing. More severe cases of gingivitis may require more intensive intervention. 

Your dentist will be able to examine your teeth and gums and determine if there are any signs of gingivitis or another serious condition. Based on what they find, they will be able to recommend if you need any specific treatment other than a good cleaning. "
If your jaw cramps does it mean you have TMJ?,"The TMJ (TemporoMandibular Joint) is a relatively complex joint. The mandible (lower jaw) not only has a hinge-like function with minor opening and closing, but it will also allow a sliding action with very wide opening. This can be felt if you put your fingers on the joint (underneath your ear canal on your cheek) and open your jaw slowly, then very wide. Typically people with TMJ disorders have pain with chewing, decreased range of motion of the joint, crepitus within the joint, or repeat subluxation. The pain with movement and chewing is usually from an inflammatory process (like <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>). Decreased range of motion can be from scarring, or wearing of the hyaline cartilage within the joint. Crepitus is the medical term for the ""pop"" or ""click"", even ""crunching"" that can happen with joint movement if the joint doesn't move smoothly. Lastly subluxation is a term that refers to a joint becoming dislocated, and sliding back into the joint capsule. This can be painful, and leads to inflammation that can take a few weeks to go back to normal. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""my jaw cramps"". That terminology makes me think of muscular problems which wouldn't necessarily be TMJ. But if you are describing subluxation, it may be related to the actual joint. I recommend that you make an appointment with a TMJ specialist (typically a trained <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a>) to have your TMJ evaluated. They should be able to help determine what is going on. If you don't know of one, start with your general dentist and see if they can refer you if they can't tell you with confidence what they think if going on. Best of luck. "
How do you make gingivitis go away?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your teeth and gums. If you do not have dental insurance, then going to see your <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a> would be a good place to start. They can at least examine your mouth and help you determine if you have gingivitis, which is an inflammation of the gums caused usually by bacteria and debris building up in the space between the teeth and the gums. Also, if the case is severe, they may be able to give you some antibiotics to help calm down the inflammation. 

However, after this, if the diagnosis is confirmed, you will have to get in to see a dentist. This is because the definitive treatment for gingivitis requires cleaning out the space between the teeth and the gums, which is not something that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be trained to do; only <a href=""/dentists"">dentists</a> perform this procedure. Not delaying is important, because if gingivitis is left untreated for a long period of time, it can lead to serious damage to the teeth and require even more invasive and expensive treatments than just a simple cleaning. 

Get in to see your doctor today, and also work on getting an appointment with a dentist. "
Is my pain medication causing my upset stomach?,"Narco is the brand name for a medication that contains a combination of two different medications, acetaminophen (Tylenol) and hydrocodone. Hydrocodone is a mild opioid medication related to morphine. The combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone is really effective for the kind of pain that occurs after a dental operation, such as a <a href=""/procedure/tooth-extraction-182"">tooth extraction</a>. 

Generally, the medication is well tolerated. However, there are some side effects. One of the most common of those side effects is nausea Sometimes, the nausea can be minimized if you take the medication with food, as taking in on an empty stomach is more likely to lead to rapid absorption of the medication and worse nausea. 

You should talk to your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> who prescribed the medication for you and let them know you are having a hard time tolerating your pain medication. They should be able to suggest an alternative medication for you if necessary. 

Make sure that you don't take any other over the counter pain medications without checking with your dentist first, as some of these may increase your risk of <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> from where you had the dental work done. 

I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Should I go to the doctor if my gums are swollen?,"It is important to maintain a healthy gum because it is not only important in your dental health, but in your overall well-being.  Gums are made of delicate tissue and an inflammation is almost always a cause of concern.  When your gums become swollen and sensitive, it can lead to gum disease.  The swelling itself is often a result of white blood cells and fluids that are counteracting the action of the bacteria causing irritation and inflammation along the gum line.  There are a few reasons why your gums become swollen.  In most cases, swollen gums are linked to gingivitis, a very common oral problem that is caused by excess bacteria in the mouth.  When you have gingivitis, you can expect to have red and <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> gums and bad breath to go along with the swelling.  In most cases of gum diseases, swollen gums are often a warning sign of a much more serous condition called periodontitis.  If left untreated, periodontitis can worsen and ultimately lead to tooth loss.   Apart from dental conditions, some diseases or deficiency conditions may also cause swollen gums.  They include vitamin C deficiency, leukemia, tumors or abnormal growth on the gingiva, which may be harmless or can be cancerous, and certain drugs you take, etc.  I would recommend an immediate visit with a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> to have your oral health evaluated first.   Your dentist may refer you to a physician if it is determined that your swollen gums are caused by a medical condition.   "
Why are my gums turning white?,"There are several potential causes of white gums. One simple cause is the collection of food and other debris along the edge of the gums where they contact they teeth. If the white discoloration is limited to this part of the gums in your case, this may be what is going on, and the condition should respond to improved brushing, although you probably also would need to see your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> for a formal teeth cleaning. 

If the white areas of the gums are not limited to the edges of the teeth but are rather flat areas that cover the roof of your mouth, cheeks, or other similar areas then there are at least two possibilities. The first is that you have thrush, which is a fungal infection of the mouth; in this condition, you can usually scrape of the white areas, although the tissue underneath may bleed. The second condition is leukoplakia, which is a precancerous condition that tends to occur mostly in those who use tobacco or alcohol; these spots cannot be scratched off. 

You should go see either your dentist or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>; both of them will be able to diagnose what is going on and help you figure out what to do next. "
If I grind my teeth does it mean that something is wrong with my jaw?,"Bruxism is the medical term to describe clenching or grinding of the teeth.  People who have bruxism may unconscioulsy clench their teeth during the day or grind their teeth at nighttime.  The latter form, which are the symptoms you are describing is sleep bruxism.  It can be quite mild and may not require treatment, but in some people it can be severe enough to lead to jaw disorders, damaged teeth, headaches and other more serious problems.  You should talk to your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> about evaluating your teeth.

The causes of bruxism are not known but certain factors may increase your risk for it.  These factors include stress and certain substances like tobacco, caffeinated beverages or alcohol and illegal drugs such as metamphetamines.  Other causes include suppressed anger or frustration, response to pain from an earache and an unknown side effect from some psychiatric medications like antidepressants. 

In most cases, bruxism does not cause serious complications, but severe bruxism can lead to certain complications.  These include damage to teeth or jaw, tension-type headaches, <a href=""/procedure/facial-pain-1466"">facial pain</a> and problems with your jaw.  

It is not possible for you to receive a diagnosis without being evaluated by a <a href=""/dentists"">doctor</a>.  I strongly advise you consult your physician / dentist in person.  Your dentist can evaluate your situation and can fit you with a mouth guard if he or she sees fit.  In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding or cutting back on drinks with caffeine and trying to relax your jaw muscles at night by holding a warm washcloth over your jaw at night.  
"
Why do my teeth feel loose?,"Teeth being lose can be a very serious problem, and is something that should be evaluated immediately by a <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> that you trust. This can be a sign of gum disease, bone disease, soft tissue disease, and also tooth disease, as any of these can cause some losening of the teeth. Your dental hygiene and your social history (including your use of alcohol and tobacco products) may give some clues as to the likely source of your problem. Obviously, tobacco use is extremely damaging to your teeth, mouth, and the rest of your body, and may be one explanation. It would also be important to visit a professional in the near future and describe any associated symptoms that you may be having. Finally, it is important to find a dentist that you can trust. Referrences can be a valuable source, as can web sites that offer opinions and ratings. Treat these with care, however, as they often tend to be skewed by one very good or very bad opinion. If you have concerns with the plan of care, it is always appropriate to seek a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a>. Most importantly, do make sure to see someone soon, as your teeth and their health can affect you in many ways. "
Can you completely clean out your system?,"""Cleansing the body"" of toxins is a common theme in alternative health circles. Sometimes, what is meant by this is that you eat a restricted diet (such as just fruit or vegetable juices) for a while. Other times, 'cleansing' may also include a purge, designed to clean out your colon. 

Generally speaking, there is no scientific evidence that any of these methods or approaches have any significant health benefits. In general, it is best to avoid any extreme diets, such as an all-juice diet. These extreme diets do not help you reinforce overall healthy eating habits for life and, in some people with chronic medical problems, they may actually be dangerous. 

Similarly, colonic or intestinal purging doesn't have any health benefits, and it may be dangerous, especially in the elderly or in those with kidney or heart problems, as it could lead to extreme shifts in blood chemistry or fluid shifts. 

It would be best in this situation instead to make an appointment with a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> or with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They can discuss potential healthy eating plans with you and help you meet your diet and exercise goals through the development of a realistic and safe approach. "
What is the best way to lose excess body fat?,"Most people who are otherwise relatively healthy and not seriously overweight should be able to begin moderate aerobic exercise without consulting a <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a> first. However, the caveat is that if you are seriously overweight, or if you have any chronic medical conditions such as diabetes or a heart condition, you should see your doctor prior to starting any exercise program to determine whether or not you have any exercise restrictions. 

Your doctor can also give you some advice on how to combine an effective, healthy diet with your exercise program. A referral to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> might be helpful as well, as they will be able to sit down with you and help you define your <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> goals and come up with effective meal plans. 

In terms of your exercise program, you should focus on consistency. It is recommended that you engage in some form of aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes per day on most days of the week. You should exercise hard enough that you are sweating and breathing a little fast when you finish. 

I advise that you set up a visit with your doctor for more information about losing weight and developing an effective combined diet and exercise plan."
Could I be developing diabetes?,"I think these symptoms should definitely be checked out by your <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a>, especially since you are overweight, which is a major risk factor for developing diabetes. The other major risk factor would be a family history of diabetes. 

Symptoms of diabetes can include frequent thirst, as well as <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a>, weight loss, constant hunger, and blurry vision. Your doctor will be able to perform some basic blood tests to screen you for diabetes. If you have not had a full annual physical in a while, it would be good to schedule this because, in addition to looking for evidence for diabetes, your doctor will also look at your weight, your blood pressure, your cholesterol levels, and other important indicators of your over all health. 

If you turn out not to have diabetes, it will still be important to work on losing some weight, as this is the most effective intervention you can make in terms of preventing developing diabetes later in life. Your doctor will be able to give you some advice on how to lose weight, including how to start an exercise program. They may also be able to refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>, who can give you advice on how to start a healthy eating plan. "
How can someone increase their metabolism?,"First of all, congratulations on deciding to try to lose some weight! This is a very important step towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting yourself from heart disease, diabetes, and other complications later in life. 

When trying to lose weight, the most important things to do are to exercise regularly and to eat a healthy, balanced diet. 

Exercise can have some effects on 'metabolism boosting' but, more importantly, it works by helping you to burn excess calories off, resulting in <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>. It is important to pick an aerobic form of exercise, which is the type of exercise which is best for the heart. A good rule of thumb is that you should perform at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days of the week. You should exercise hard enough that you are sweaty and breathing fast when you finish. 

Eating a healthy, nutritious diet that meets your caloric needs but does not exceed them is also important. Rather than crash or fad diets, the best approach is actually to sit down with a nutritionist, who can help you come up with a realistic, sustainable diet plan that is tailored to your needs.

Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> for more information!"
What is the right number of calories I should have in one day?,"The exact number of calories that you should eat in a day depends both on your gender and also on your current height and weight. For example, if you are overweight and you are trying to lose some weight, then this obviously means that you will have to consume less calories. Based on your data that you provide (6 foot and 175 pounds), I have calculated your body mass index at 23.7 (assuming you are male). This puts you in the range of healthy weight for your height, so you shouldn't need to lose any weight. A BMI of greater than 25 would put you in the overweight category. 

Assuming you don't need to lose any weight, then the amount of calories you should consume also will depend on your age (the older you are the less calories you need) and your activity level. If you are a professional athlete you will obviously need more calories than if you have a desk job!

One excellent approach would be to talk with your <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a>. He or she will be able to assess your activity level and help you calculate how many calories you should be taking in. "
How do you know if you're developing diabetes?,"You should definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about these symptoms. Symptoms of adult onset diabetes, which is what you are concerned about, can include <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a>, as well as fatigue, weight changes, blurry vision, and other symptoms. 

The fact that you are a bit overweight and that you consume a lot of sugar products is also concerning. 

Although there are many potential causes of the symptoms you are describing, diabetes is definitely one of them. Your primary care doctor will be able to perform a complete physical examination to help you determine whether this is diabetes or whether, equally importantly, there is another cause. Most likely, they will want to do some simple blood tests to rule out diabetes and other common conditions. 

In addition to this, you should ask your primary care doctor for some advice about how to become more physically active and lose some weight, as well as asking for advice about how to cut down on your sugar intake. Your doctor may even be able to send you to see a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> to work on these things. Making positive changes in your exercise and eating habits now will be important for preventing disease in the future!"
Is there any way to cure diabetes?,"The type of diabetes that you are talking about, called type 2 diabetes, has a strong genetic component. This means that if you have people in your family who also have diabetes, you are at much higher risk of developing it yourself. 

That being said, genetics alone are not enough to end up with diabetes. Lifestyle is also very important, and it is the combination of genetics and lifestyle that bring the disease out. Fortunately, lifestyle is something you can control if you work hard. 

Being overweight is definitely the main contributor to developing diabetes down the road. Being overweight changes the way your body processes sugar, and this eventually can lead to diabetes. Reducing your weight, together with regular, daily exercise, and eating a healthy, balanced diet can all help you reduce your risk of developing diabetes. 

I suggest that you start by going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. First, they can test you for diabetes using simple blood tests. Second, they can make recommendations to you about how to begin dieting and exercising. They may also want to refer you to a professional <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>, who can help you restructure your meal plans in the most healthy way possible. "
Do muscle-building supplements work?,"Health and nutrition supplements are a very interesting part of the American health system, one that brings in billions of dollars to companies annually. Companies are especially interested in these products because there is very little government oversight. For example, when drug companies market medications, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requirements that demand that the company prove that the medications not only are safe, but that they work. This is obviously a very expensive process. But supplements can avoid all of this: they require only marginal safety data and absolutely no proof that they work. That is why so many of these supplements use testimonials to demonstrate that they work: there IS no solid proof. That being said, your body needs protein to build muscle. Some proteins supplements therefore at least have a scientific basis for working. Creatine is another supplement that attempts to mimic what the body uses and creates naturally. There is some evidence that supplementation with this product can increase muscle mass. Both protein and creatine supplements can be dangerous, however, and it is important to speak to your <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a> or a sports medicine physician before starting any supplement for a specific goal."
What is a ?superfood??,"Superfood is a claim that is made often for many foods. This however is essentially a marketing strategy -- a way to advertise foods -- and has little to no basis in medical science. I would recommend discussing your concerns with your <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a>. It is also possible that your doctor can refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> -- a nutrition specialist -- who can further help you identify foods that you should incorporate into your diet.

A superfood is a claim made for foods that supposedly have a high number of vitamins, mineral and/or anti-oxidants. That being said, there is no legal definition. This is simply a term that companies put on foods to help sell them. In fact, in Europe, the term is banned as it is essentially thought of as false advertising.

That being said, there are some foods that are more nutritious for you than others. Your body requires a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, protein, fat etc in order to properly function. Unfortunately, no one food contains all the required elements.  Therefore a wide range and balance of foods are needed. In this regard a dietician can help guide you to the food groups that are the best for your health. Good luck!"
Which diet is best for me?,"Dieting is a difficult subject. That being said, the goal of your diet is really the key -- are you trying to lose weight or are there other concerns (for example gaining muscle mass). Regardless, it is a complex and difficult process. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she can put you in touch with a registered <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> -- an expert in diets. Together, they can help you develop a feasible, successful and healthy diet.

There are numerous diets on the market, all with fancy names, books and devices. Most of these are designed to lose weight. Unfortunately, the data behind these working is minimal at best. People often loose weight 6 months after starting the diet (5-10 lbs) but at one year the weight is back. Essentially this is because these ""fad"" diets are not sustainable and some are even unhealthy.

What you need are changes that are sustainable for life. The biggest fundamental concept to understand is that <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> is an energy balance -- you need to consume less energy (measure in calories) than you expend (by exercise etc). In all the studies done, the biggest factor for a successful diet is portion control.

Please talk to your doctor."
How can I gain fat if I am very thin?,"Our perception of our body image is a difficult thing to understand. We see so many examples of people who would love to be thin (probably those who make fun of you!), and then there is another segment that have a hard time gaining weight. As physicians, it is our job to make sure that people are healthy so that they can have the highest quality of life. Eating a regular and balanced diet is an important part of that. While you will eventually gain weight by eating fast food, the ill effects it will have on your health (<a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, heart problems, potentially cancer, and a host of other problems) are not worth the price. Additionally, that weight would be likely to be concentrated in your abdomen, which is the place that men deposit most of their fat. A better alternative is to gain healthy weight, which is not as easy. For most men, resistance training (such as lifting weights in a gym) provides an opportunity to increase their body weight in a healthy way, by adding muscle. You will need to make sure that your diet contains adequate protein and other nutrients for this to happen. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be able to give you further advice and make specific recommendations. Please speak to him or her. "
Who should get a weight loss consultation?,"If you are looking to lose weight, then a weight loss consultation might be appropriate for you. There are many kinds of health professionals that can help you with this, which indicates how many people are trying to lose weight, and also that it can be difficult by yourself. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> would be a great place to start. As the physician that knows you and your dieting history best, he or she will be able to direct you to the appropriate specialist or professional from there. A great place to start after that might be meeting with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> or dietitian, who will be able to assess your current diet and make recommendations that can help. Exercise will be an important part of this as well. If this is not sufficient, then your primary doctor will consider other options as well. Specialists include endocrinologists, and, ultimately, bariatric <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeons</a> who can provide surgical options as well (such as gastric bypass or gastric banding). Surgical options are excellent for some people, but are usually reserved for those who have failed more conservative measures and whose obesity is seriously impacting their health and quality of life. Please speak to your primary care doctor today. "
Can I get a six pack through diet alone?,"A six pack is a common desire among young people. This however, is a difficult and sometimes dangerous goal to achieve. I would recommend that you discuss this with your primary  care <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a>. He or she can help you achieve a realistic goal (and this may be one) in a healthy and safe manner.

A six pack is the common term that refers to when the fat on the stomach is thin enough to allow for a view of the abdominus rectus muscle. This abdominal muscle has septations into 10 different pouches -- and often the bottom of these six can be seen if the overlying fat/skin is thin -- this results in the appearance of a six pack.

In order to get this six pack -- you need to achieve an extremely thin layer of fat over the abdomen, as well as strong abdominus rectus muscles. Therefore, losing weight (thereby losing fat) is the real key to do this. You are right in the dieting is the major component of any <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> regimen. Keep in mind exercise (not just the abdomen but all over) can also be very important in successful weight loss.

Keep in mind this can be difficult to achieve, and occasionally an unsafe or unrealistic goal. Talk to your doctor about this. Good luck!"
Should cyclists receive sport nutrition consultation?,"Most amateur cyclists and other amateur athletes do not need to have a formal sports nutrition consultation. This is because most amateur athletes do not ever get to the level of performance where adequate nutrition is a major issue. 

For most amateurs, therefore, reading up on advice from other cyclists and in cycling magazines and books on how to stay nourished and well hydrated while on a ride is probably sufficient. You can ask your fellow riders what types of gels or other nutrition supplements they use and experiment with these until you find one that works for you. 

On the other hand, if you are a professional cyclist then a nutrition consultation is probably a good idea. This is because the demands of professional training are often quite impressive, and it can be very helpful to have a professional <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> making sure you are making your goals. 

As always, the most important thing, while professional or amateur, while exercising is to do so prudently and not to overstep your limits. Dehydration is much more dangerous in the short term than any other nutritional concern and so, at a minimum, it is important to keep up with your fluid requirements while riding. 

Please talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for more information about staying healthy while exercising."
Are there any drawbacks to liposuction?,"Liposuction is a surgical technique in which excess fat and fat cells are removed from under the skin using a suction probe that is introduced under the skin through small incisions. Liposuction is generally a very well tolerated procedure, although it does carry the standard risks of any surgical procedure, such as bleeding and infection. Your plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> will explain all of this to you when you set up your first appointment. 

In terms of permanent weight loss, liposuction is definitely not the answer. Liposuction is just a temporary quick fix that can immediately reduce fat tissue. However, it does not correct the underlying bad eating habits that led to being overweight in the first place. If you do not correct these habits, the fat tissue will simply come back over time. 

The only effective way to permanently keep off weight is by adopting a program of exercise and diet. A <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> can help you come up with an effective dieting plan that also helps you learn how to eat more healthy foods in the future. Also, most <a href=""/dietitians"">doctors</a> would recommend that you try to get at least 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days of the week in order to achieve lasting weight control. "
Will liposuction get rid of my fat forever?,"<a href=""/procedure/liposuction-1086"">Liposuction</a> is a technique in which suction is used to remove fat cells from under the skin through small incisions. This results in an immediate reduction in the number of the fat cells as well as their fat content and, in that sense, the effects of liposuction are permanent. 

However, the body has an amazing capacity to generate and store fat. Therefore, if you do not change the lifestyle factors that led to the accumulation of the fat in the first place, the remaining fat cells in your body will simply enlarge and refill the space that the liposuction took care of. 

For these reasons, the only effective way to permanently reduce weight is through diet and exercise. If you are interested in this approach, you should go see a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a>, who will be able to counsel you about your eating habits and weight loss needs and help you come up with a realistic plan for losing weight. On top of this, regular exercise is critical. Most <a href=""/dietitians"">doctors</a> would recommend that you engage in at least 30-60 minutes on most days of aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise must be intense enough to raise your heart rate and to make you sweat. "
What forms of exercise provide permanent weight loss?,"It sounds like you probably have a bit of osteoarthritis, which is age - related changes in the joints that make then stiff and sore, especially after exercise or other strenuous activity. 

At the same time <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> is really important for keeping yourself healthy over the long haul. Therefore, trying to find exercises that you can perform that do not hurt your joints (so that you can keep performing them) is important. 

I suggest that you think about lower impact exercises. Running and jogging are probably too high of impact for you, but swimming, elliptical, or even just walking might be tolerable. The recommendation for healthy living and weight loss is that you engage in at least 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week. The exercise has to be sufficiently vigorous to make you sweat and raise your heart rate. So you should look for a type of exercise that you can perform at this level without being too sore. 

Luckily there is no magic about one type of exercise versus another. So, pick which ever form of aerobic exercise is most comfortable for you. If you can perform that exercise at the recommended level, then this should help you lose weight. 

Don't forget to talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> before initiating any exercise program, just to make sure there are no medical reasons why you would need to modify your routine."
Can diet shakes result in weight loss?,"There are many different diet fads and gimmicks: low carbs, shakes, diet pills, etc.  Ultimately, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> comes down to burning more calories than you take in.  This involves increasing your exercise frequency, intensity and duration to increase your calorie expenditure, and decreasing your portion sizes and meal frequency in order to take in fewer calories. 

Diet shakes are meant to REPLACE your meals.  Many people find them unsatisfying and unfilling, however, just as you have.  If you continue to eat your usual diet and to drink shakes, you will certainly NOT lose weight, you will actually gain MORE weight, as your calorie intake will be higher.

You should meet with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss weight loss strategies further.  He or she can make a referral to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> or a dietician, and as a group you can come up with the safest and most effective approach to weight loss.  You will develop a safe exercise regimen depending on your age, abilities and other illnesses, and you will work on a diet that helps you to minimize your calories while not feeling very hungry."
Do fruit smoothies aid in weight control?,"Fruit smoothies are often thought of as an aid to <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>. However, most commercial fruit smoothies (that you buy in a smoothie shop) also have, in addition to fresh fruit, very high amounts of sugar added to them. Therefore, you may think that you are taking a healthy snack when, in fact, you are drinking a calorie bomb! To avoid this, make your own smoothies at home (without sugar or sweetener added) or read the nutrition facts on the various smoothies available at the shop prior to purchasing. 

Effective weight loss can't happen just by selecting one or two healthy food types either. It requires eating regular balanced meals that are nutritious and low in concentrated fats and sweets. If you are interested in weight loss, you should meet with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>, as they will be able to help you develop an effective diet plan. 

Don't forget either that effective weight loss requires regular, daily aerobic exercise. You should engage in at least 30-60 minutes on most days of the week of aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat in order to maximize your weight loss potential. "
Will type 2 diabetes affect my eating choices?,"Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body's ability to use insulin effectively is diminished. Since insulin is the substance that promotes the utilization of sugar, the concentration of sugar in the blood rises. This leads to many problems over the life span if it is not taken care of, such as heart disease, kidney disease, eye trouble, and many other things. 

Taking care of type 2 diabetes absolutely requires changing the way you eat. In particular concentrated sweet foods (such as refined sugar, non diet soft drinks, etc) must be strictly avoided, as these greatly increase the concentration of sugar in the blood. But there are many other changes to the diet that need to be made as well. It sounds like this is a new diagnosis for you, so you should definitely set up an appointment with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> who can walk you through diabetic meal plans and help you figure out how to eat appropriately to manage the condition. 

Eating choices are also important because being overweight is a big part of what triggers the development of diabetes. Therefore if you can begin to exercise and lose some weight (and restrict your caloric intake) it is possible that your diabetes will improve somewhat. "
Can having a level of triglycerides cause obesity?,"Triglycerides are a measure of how much fat is floating around the blood.  Like cholesterol, there is a genetic component to them, but also a very significant dietary component.  Just like if you eat a lot of foods high in cholesterol you will increase your cholesterol levels, if you eat a lot of foods that are high in fat content, you will increase your triglycerides.  However, triglycerides themselves do not CAUSE obesity.  

Rather, eating fatty foods causes weight gain (and thus obesity) as well as causing high triglycerides.  There are medications that can lower your triglyceride levels, but none of these have been shown to decrease your risk of heart attacks and strokes, and they most certainly will not help you lose weight and prevent obesity.  The only way to do lower your triglycerides and ALSO lose weight (and prevent becoming obese) is to improve your diet by eating smaller portions and decreasing how much of your diet comes from fat.  Increasing your frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise will help you to lose weight and prevent obesity, too.

You should make an appointment with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> or a dietician to discuss this further.  Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> can help to facilitate this."
Is the South Beach diet one that recommends cutting out carbs?,"Calories come from three basic building blocks of foods: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.  Alcohol also contains calories.  There are a lot of fad diets that try to manipulate what percentage of your dietary calorie intake comes from each of these groups.  The Atkins diet completely eliminates carbohydrates for a few weeks, then slowly introduces carbohydrates back to a very low level (less than 20% of total intake).  South Beach aims for a less restrictive balance of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, but still allows much less carbohydrates than the typical American diet.

Ultimately, regardless of what diet you are on, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> boils down to burning more calories than you take in.  Many studies have shown this.  Increasing your exercise frequency, duration and intensity will help to burn calories.  Cutting down on portion sizes and frequency of meals will help to cut down on your calorie intake.  If you find that you ""love carbs"" so much that a majority of your diet is coming from carbohydrates, you may benefit from a diet that regulates how much of this you can take in.  Like you, the typical American takes in way too many carbohydrates, particularly refined carbohydrates like white bread, sugar, corn starch-containing foods, pasta and white rice.

You should see a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> to discuss the best way to start a weight loss regimen."
Does the South Beach diet work?,"The South Beach diet is one of several fad diets that are available on the market. It is one of the less extreme of the fad diets, but nevertheless it has been criticized by the medical community because several of the principles on which it is based have absolutely no scientific backing at all. 

An alternative to the South Beach diet would be simply to set up a visit with a trained <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>. They are impartial with respect to the various fad diets (as they are not trying to sell a product) and therefore they can take an honest inventory of your overall eating habits as well as <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> goals. Based on their findings, they will be able to make specific recommendations for how to construct a healthy meal plan and move forward with weight loss. 

Do not forget that dieting alone will not produce weight loss. It must be couple with regular exercise. The recommendation is that you need to engaged in 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days of the week. Aerobic exercise is defined as exercise that raises your heart rate and that also makes you sweat. 

Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if you have more questions about weight loss!"
Why do women have lower levels of testosterone than men?,"Women have lower levels of testosterone than men because this is their way their bodies are designed. The main sex hormone in women, produced by the ovaries, is estrogen, which tends to promote the storage of fat rather than its breakdown. On the other hand, the main sex hormone in men is testosterone, produced by the testicles, which tends to promote the formation of muscle mass. Therefore, yes, men have an easier time than women losing weight quickly. 

This does not mean, however that women cannot successfully lose weight. The key to successful <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> includes consistent healthy eating. If you are having trouble with this, you should see a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a>, who will be able to make an overall assessment of your weight loss needs and eating habits and help you come up with a realistic meal plan. 

At the same time, don't forget that dieting is only half of the battle. The other half is regular exercise. If you are not regularly exercising this may be contributing to your lack of success. You should try to get in at least 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days of the week.

If you combine exercise with healthy eating, you should be able to lose weight. "
Is one style of yoga better than another at helping me lose weight?,"While there are many diet fads and exercise or fitness trends out there, generally, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> comes down to burning more calories than you take in.  So your first step will be to decrease how many calories you take in.  This can be difficult, but you can work on it with the help of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and dietician.

As for burning calories, yoga can be a great source of exercise to help you burn calories.  Generally, with exercise, the more intense the exercise is (the faster your heart beats and the more tired you get), the more calories you are burning per minute.  But you don't want to do an intensity so high that you are not able to exercise for long enough.  Yoga widely ranges in difficulty.  Vinyasa is a more relaxed form of yoga, whereas Vikram/Bikram is as a harder type that is often in a room that is warmed up to 90 degrees!  Since you are currently overweight and potentially new to yoga, you should start with one of the easier types of yoga (Vinyasa is a popular one), in a beginner's class, and slowly work your way up in difficulty until you get to a point of being able to do 4-5 full classes per week (or equivalent duration of exercise) without stopping, but while feeling at least a bit winded and tired for most of the class.

You should see a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> to discuss the most effective and safest way to start a weight loss and exercise regimen."
How does Roux-en-Y gastric bypass help one lose weight?,"Surgerical therapy for obesity can be classified as Restrictive procedures, Malabsorptive procedures, or a combination of the two. Roux en-Y is a procedure which relies on a combination of malabsorptive effect and restrictive effect to achieve the <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>. 

In a Roux en-Y procedure, the stomach is stapled off in such a way that it becomes much smaller in size. This results in early satiety, meaning patients feel full after smaller meals due to the fact that smaller amount of food fills up the stomach. That is the restrictive part of the procedure.

The malabsorptive effect is imparted by the new anatomy that is created during the operation in which a part of the small intestine is ""bypassed"" (hence the gastric bypass name). So not only do the patients eat less (because of the smaller stomach), the food they eat also isn't absorbed to the same extent because it skips some of the small intestine. 

This combination of intended malabsorption and restriction (smaller stomach) results in more substantial weight loss. While gastric bypass is a great option for many people, there are strict criteria for BMI, psychosocial stability, motivation and several other factors that predict success and therefore select whether or not a given person is a good candidate for the bypass procedure. 

Furthermore, it is still <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, and every surgery has potential complications that go with it. I strongly encourage you to speak to your bariatric <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> regarding the risks, benefits and alternatives to Roux en Y gastric bypass surgery. "
Is a raw diet healthy for diabetics?,"Raw diets can be healthy for most people, including diabetics. That being said, the utility of a raw diet is questionable in terms of how it will affect your long term health and diabetes control. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a>. In fact, it may be helpful to discuss this with a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> -- a specialist in diets.

To answer your question -- YES -- a raw diet can be healthy. One of the few populations in which we tell people to avoid a raw diet is if people are immunosupressed, i.e. they have a weakened immune system. More specifically, people who are neutropenic -- or lack a specific type of blood cell that fights infections, are advised to avoid raw foods.

For diabetics, the carbohydrate load of raw foods can be maintained in a normal state. Like before, it is important to note the carbohydrate load of each food you eat. In addition, you will need to monitor your sugars more regularly while you change your diet -- as any diet change can cause a change in insulin requirements (either up or down). Long term, there is no data to say that a raw diet is better for you. In addition, most people cannot sustain a raw diet for very long -- as such, I do not often recommend it.

Will a high-protein diet help me gain muscle mass?,"Protein is one of the essential building blocks of the human body. It is frequently used to assess a patient's nutritional status and can thereby be used to assess overall health and ability to heal. Protein is generally obtained from dietary intake. Foods that are rich in protein include meat, dairy products as well as some vegetables and legumes (e.g. beans). 

In a healthcare setting, an average person should take in approximately 1 gram of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day. This is a very basic guideline for a normal person performing normal activities of daily living. 

People who are more physically active may have increased protein demand. The guidelines on how much more are not clearly defined, however levels of 1.5-1.8 g/kg have been proposed. Many athletes and weight lifters intentionally increase their protein consumption, especially immediately following workouts to optimize protein absorption and minimize protein breakdown already stored within muscle. 

If the overall goal is to increase muscle mass, many nutrition specialists recommend ingestion of whey protein immediately after a workout. It is also important to maintain a steady balance of caloric intake throughout the day to ensure that the body doesn't go into a catabolic state where it starts to break down protein from muscle to ensure proper levels of nutrient in the bloodstream. 

There are conditions where protein intake should be limited. For example, patients with kidney damage or insufficiency should probably limit the amount of protein they ingest as this can cause an unhealthy build up of protein metabolites in the blood. 

Please consult your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> regarding an ideal dietary plan for your age, body habitus, metabolism and dietary goals.  "
What should a person in a prediabetic state do?,"Prediabetes is a very common condition. Also known as ""impaired glucose tolerance,"" this is a concerning condition. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to address this situation.

Prediabetes is a condition in which patients are at risk for progression to frank diabetes. Firstly, it is known that people with prediabetes are at themselves not at increased risk for complications of diabetes -- it is simply their risk for progression to diabetes. It is diagnosed either with the random glucose level, or more commonly now with the glycosylated hemoglobin level, or hemoglobin A1c.

As for what to do, it is important to aggressively treat prediabetes to avoid progression to diabetes. The most important factor is weight. The best way to treat diabtes is to drop some weight -- diet and exercise are very important factors for this. As you age, this become more difficult, so working with your primary care doctor and potentially a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> will be important. There are some people who think that starting diabetes medicines (like metformin) for people with prediabetes can help -- but the data do not support this and currently we do not recommend starting medicine. The other important consideration is to have close follow up to ensure you do not progress to real diabetes.

Talk to your doctor. <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">Weight loss</a> is now very important for your health. Good luck!"
How do I measure net carbs?,"To answer your question -- it depends on what you mean by ""net carbs."" There are many important reason to count carbohydrates, especially if one is trying to loose weight. That being said, any sophisticated diet change should be discussed with a trained professional. I would recommend seeing a dietician in order to better understand this topic and healthy diet options.

Carbs, or carbohydrates, are a fundamental food type. This is essentially a sugar, although not necessarily the sweet sugar we use in foods. These complex sugars include bread, pasta, vegetables and fruits as well.

If you are thinking of this in the context of weight management, the real question is not carbs, but calories. While some diets (e.g. Atkins) focus on carbs, most medical <a href=""/dietitians"">doctors</a> will say that this is less important. The real method to loose weight is to eat less CALORIES (a unit of energy) than one expends (by exercise). Each gram of carbohydrate has 3.75 calories.

Counting carbs or calories can be done using the nutritional information on the side of a food. Online calculators for vegetables and fruits can also be found.

Can obesity cause lymphedema?,"Lymphedema is a common problem. This, unfortunately, can also be very troubling and ultimately dangerous to your overall health. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. If required, he or she could refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> or dietician to help you with your weight. In addition, he or she could refer you to a vascular <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or vascular medicine expert to help directly address the lymphedema.

To answer your question -- YES -- lymphedema can be and very often is caused by obesity. Obesity is can effect lymphedema in multiple ways. Firstly, the pressure in the veins can be increased by the excess tissue. This can occur in the leg itself, in the abdomen against the larger vessels, in the chest or in the heart. Obesity is a leading contributor to heart failure -- which can cause edema. In addition, obesity can cause high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) which can cause this edema. Obesity also leads to obstructive sleep apnea which often worsens lymphedema.

Fortunately, there are many ways to treat both obesity and lymphedema. Diet and exercise of fundamental to weight control. Even outside of lymphedema there are many other reasons you need to achieve a healthy weight. I would strongly recommend addressing this with your doctor. "
Can diet cause insulin insensitivity?,"With most people, it is not a single thing that is causing their insulin insensitivity. Some people develop diabetes at a young age and are insulin dependent due to the destruction of the insulin producing cells of their pancreas (this is known as type I diabetes). More commonly, it is a lifetime of exposure to high levels of glucose (sugar) that cause the pancreas to ""wear out,"" which is known as type II diabetes. 

The pancreas makes insulin in response to elevated blood sugar in normal, healthy people. If it has to make too much for too long, it seems to have difficulty keeping up. The body responds with a somewhat inflammatory reaction in the pancreas that causes the insulin producing cells to be replaced with inflammatory tissue, reducing their ability to respond. Additionally, the rest of the cells in the body of these people become resistant to the high levels of insulin that they are used to seeing, meaning that it takes more and more for the same effect (think of your morning dose of coffee). 

Diet and exercise can make the body respond more fully to the changes in blood sugar levels for these people. Please work with your <a href=""/dietitians"">doctor</a> to optimize your diabetic control and reduce the complications it can bring. "
How can I achieve my ideal body weight?,"Achieving a healthy body weight is one of the most important and advisable goals. I congratulate you one recognizing the importance of this. I would recommend discussing this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she may provide you with information on who to achieve a healthy weight.

Firstly, it is important to identify what you ideal weight is. There are many ways to identify your ideal body weight -- but the most common is identifying your Body Mass Index (BMI). This is calculated based on your height and weight -- I would recommend calculating your BMI (use an online calculator). A BMI between 18.5 and 23 is ideal. But beyond your actual weight it is important to be ""fit and healthy."" Talking with your primary care doctor to identify an appropriate goal is important. There is a risk of being to thin, so identifying the appropriate goal is important.

As to how to lose the last  few pounds -- these are often the hardest. That being said the fundamentals of losing weight are simple -- you need to eat less energy than you expend. Eating less and exercising more is the key. Seeing your doctor to identify a good diet plan -- possibly with a referral to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> -- would be advisable.

Good luck!"
How can I develop a healthy weight loss plan?,"Firstly, congratulations on recognizing that maintaining a healthy weight is important. In fact, maintaining a good weight is the single most important thing you can do for your body. Unfortunately, it is a tough task. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. He or she can refer you to a nutritionist (or a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a>) who can help you tailor a specific diet based on your body type, size and food likes/dislikes.

Weight loss is complicated -- but really a simple concept. Essentially the body has to expend (use) more energy than it consumes in order to lose weight. Breathing, walking and exercising are the ways we use energy. The foods we eat and drink is the energy that we put in. The unit of energy is calories -- calories in the food must be less than calories we use during exercise in order to lose weight. In general, a male your age probably uses around 2200 calories a day just with normal life function (heart beating, lungs breathing etc). Therefore, you have to eat less that 2200 calories a day to lose weight. Keep in mind exercise can also increase how many calories you expend -- but the key is eating less. Looking on the side of food for calorie contents can help. Keep in mind drinks have a lot of calories too. If you are negative about 3500 calories, that is equivalent to losing one pound.

Talk to a dietician. Good luck!"
Can healthy weight loss make me look better?,"Maintaining a healthy weight is an excellent way to promote lifelong health and well-being.  Besides the emotional benefits of knowing you look your best, keeping a healthy weight can help reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, liver disease, joint disease, and even many kinds of cancers.

Losing weight is mathematically simple: if you take in fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight.  However, calorie restriction without paying attention to maintaining a balanced calorie intake can lead to health problems related to nutritional deficiencies. In addition, as you indicate, merely losing weight will not necessarily give you a fit, toned figure.

In order to help maximize the benefits from your <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> plan, it may be helpful for you to talk to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> and possibly to a personal trainer.  You can always talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> about a referral to a dietician, as some PCP practices may have dieticians they recommend.  Overall, a dietician can help guide you in developing a healthy eating plan that will minimize calories to help you lose weight while also making sure you include the right nutrients and vitamins in your diet. In a similar way, a personal trainer can help you incorporate exercise into your daily routine with a goal of both weight loss but also adding lean muscle which will give you the toned look you are after."
How can I drop pounds so I can be a healthy weight again?,"Maintaining a healthy weight is one, if not the most, important techniques to improve your overall health and well being. I congratulate you on recognizing the need for this. I would recommend discussing this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This is a complicated issue and a trained medical professional is very helpful.

Firstly, it is important to identify what your healthy weight should be. There is no perfect way to do this, but measuring your Body Mass Index or BMI is one of the best options we have. BMI is based on your height and weight. I would recommend looking online for a BMI calculator. Healthy BMIs are normally 18-25.

If it appears you are overweight and need to lose weight, there are many options. Overall, the simple fact is to lose weight one needs to consume less energy (measured as calories) than one expends. Therefore increasing your energy expenditure (by exercising) and decreasing your intake (food and drinks) is the fundamental way. In actuality, we know decreasing intake and eating healthier / lower calorie foods is the most important aspect as exercise alone is not as effective. Talking to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> or nutritionist is important to help tailor your diet.

Talk to your doctor. Good luck!"
How can I determine a healthy BMI for myself?,"BMI, or body mass index, is a standard measure of the ratio between a person's height and weight.  The advantage of using BMI as a way of monitoring a healthy body weight is that it accounts for the variation in different body types for determining a health weight.  Generally accepted ranges in the medical literature indicate that a healthy body weight for a person's given height should result in a BMI between 18.5 and 25.  A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight, and a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.  Your BMI is 20.9 which indicates that you are at a healthy body weight for your height.  Online calculators do the same math that you can do yourself: take your weight in pounds and divide by your height in inches squared, then multiple that product by 703.

The BMI is not a perfect measure, but its limitations likely do not apply to you given your age.  In younger patients with a high muscle mass (and thus a higher weight because muscle is the most dense body tissue), a BMI may appear to be falsely elevated. Similarly, in elderly patients a BMI may underestimate body fat.  However, at age 25, it seems that your BMI is perfectly healthy. If you have questions about your weight, you can always discuss this further with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>."
Is fast weight loss possible from not eating?,"Not eating is the probably the least safe and least effective way to lose weight.  Your husband is correct in that when you do not eat your body goes into starvation mode and tries to store energy to the greatest degree possible when new food is taken in.  This being the case, when an individual gives in and finally eats (which is usually the case before too long) the body stores every bit of the meal that is not immediately needed as fat.  

Another reason starvation diets do not work is that when people finally break down and eat after they have been starving themselves, they tend to overeat and indulge in foods with a high caloric density such and high fat and high sugar foods - this leads to even more fat being stored. Even if starvation were a good way to lose weight, it is extremely unsafe.  The electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, and nutrient deficiencies that are created by intentional starvation have the potential to create severe metabolic disorders that can result in the need for prolonged hospitalization or even death.  

As evidence, anorexia (a common <a href=""/procedure/eating-disorder-180"">eating disorder</a>) has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder, owing largely to the debilitated state induced by prolonged starvation.  One of the healthiest ways to loose weight rapidly is a regular program of aerobic exercise coupled with a low fat, low calorie diet high in vegetables, complex carbohydrates like fiber and whole grains, and lean meats.  You should set up a consultation with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>, dietician, and/or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> as soon as possible to set up a reasonably diet and exercise plan to help you lose weight while maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  "
What foods should I eat for fast weight loss?,"<a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">Weight loss</a> is a complex process. As you know, obesity is a major problem facing millions of Americans and people worldwide. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she can help you develop a healthy and safe way to drop some weight.

Firstly, congratulations on recognizing you need to lose weight. This is the first and important step. Secondly, unfortunately there is not ""fast"" way to lose weight. We know that people who drop weight fast from the fad diets are nearly 100% likely to put the weight back on. What you need is a steady, fundamental change to your lifestyle as this is the only proven way to drop the weight and keep it off.

Ultimately, weight loss is about energy balance. You need to expend more calories (energy) than you consume. That means increase your exercise, and eat fewer calories. Calories intake (what you eat) is probably the most important factor. Therefore eating lower calorie foods is important. It is ok to eat pasta or carbs, just moderate you portion size. The ""no carb"" diets work because proteins and vegetables often have fewer calories -- but this is not always the easiest thing to do.

Talk to your doctor. You would likely benefit from seeing a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> -- a food specialist -- to help you on your way. Good luck!"
Is the Atkins diet dangerous?,"The Atkins diet recommends cutting out carbohydrates entirely for a few weeks, then slowly adding them back in and ramping up to a low level (approximately 20%) of carbohydrates in your diet.  This first few weeks causes your body to go into something called ""ketosis"" where you stop using glucose and glycogen for energy, and your body shifts to using ketones (an acidic substance derived from fat breakdown) for energy.  While this promotes the breakdown of fat, your muscles, heart and brain are not accustomed to exclusively using ketones for energy, and these first few weeks can cause many symptoms: headaches, <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, nausea, dehydration, fatigue.  To a healthy young person, this is not dangerous, however, patients with other diseases may have some problems with going into ketosis because their bodies become quite dehydrated and acidemic (acidic blood).  This can cause arrhythmia, fainting, kidney problems, loss of memory, etc.

Ultimately losing weight comes down to a balance of calories consumed versus calories burned in exercise.  Increasing your exercise duration, frequency and intensity can help you to lose weight more rapidly.  As far as decreasing calories, cutting down on portion sizes and meal frequency can help.  If you find that your current diet is very heavy in carbs, restricting them may be helpful to achieve this, however, diets that are not quite as carb restrictive as Atkins are often easier to stick to.  Consider the Zone or South Beach diet.

"I have had three L5 S1 lumbar diskectomy surgeries where the same disk herniated on three occasions, how at risk am I for having the disk herniate a fourth time and is it likely that the same diskectomy surgery would be required or a more complicated surgery to fix the probolem?","In patients such as yourself, who have had more than one herniated disc at the same level, and have had multiple surgeries to try and correct this, the next step is to perform a somewhat more involved procedure called a fusion. It is unclear why some patients develop recurrent herniated discs, although it is believed that there is continued motion at that level and for reasons that are beyond the scope of this discussion, the disc continues to herniate, leaving you with the nerve pains (also known as radicular pains) that you are experiencing. The fusion procedure involves placing screws and rods into the bones of your spine at that level, and placing bone along the edges of the spine. In the long run, the bone will eventually fuse and the motion that you are experiencing at this level should cease. When the motion ceases, it is expected that the disc will stop herniating. Some of the main risks of this procedure include spinal fluid leakage, nerve damage, infections, and bleeding, amongst a host of other risks. It is best to discuss this with your spine <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (<a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeons</a> and <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeons</a> perform this most commonly) for more information and further work up."
Can laser treatment help spinal stenosis?,"I am sorry to hear that your father has spinal stenosis.  This can be a very tough condition to live with (as you most likely know).  Basically, spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal which results in compression of the spinal cord.  This compression causes different symptoms depending on where your father's spinal stenosis is.  If it is in the lower back, then it can cause pain, numbness, and <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a> in the legs.  

The best initial treatment for spinal stenosis is physical therapy.  Spinal injections and anti-inflammatory medications are used next or along with physical therapy in some patients.  It is important to give these modes of treatment a chance to work because <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> is not always the best option.  Unfortunately, there are no laser surgeries that are currently available for spinal stenosis.  The gold standard operation is the laminectomy.  This is where part of the spinal column is removed and adjusted to allow for more room in the spinal column.  More often than not, the laminectomy is effective at relieving the symptoms of spinals stenosis.  It is reserved for severe cases that fail the more conservative treatments.  

It sounds like your father's condition is severe, and thus it probably would not be a bad idea for you to consult with a <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a>.  He or she can get an MRI of your father's back and determine which mode of treatment is best for him.  That way your father can decide for himself what he would like to do.  "
Can 5 days on HCG Injection Diet delay my menstrual cycle?,"It seems like there are several active issues with your health at the moment, the first of which is whether or not you want to be pregnant.

Home pregnancy tests do need to be confirmed with a blood test, so it would definitely be a good idea for you to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away and arrange for this testing. He or she can also discuss your options should you be pregnant.

Next, there is also the issue of your diet and the effects of HCG.

There is significant concern within the medical community that these products are not safe. In addition, the extreme caloric restriction that typically accompanies HCG supplements on the so-called 'HCG diet' can have very damaging overall effects on your health. Your desire to maintain a healthy body weight is a good one, but it is important to lose weight in a healthy way and develop a lifestyle that includes healthy exercise and diet as a way of preserving your health. Ingesting HCG, an unregulated, unapproved supplement could be very dangerous to your health. Your physician can help you develop a plan to maintain a healthy body weight in a healthy way.

Does a high glucose level mean I have diabetes?,"Diabetes Mellitus is a condition in which glucose is not metabolized correctly and results in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).  There are two main types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2.  Diabetes can be diagnosed at any age.  Both your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> can help with further evaluation of the high glucose seen on your blood tests.

In order to make a diagnosis, your physician will need to obtain a few more tests.  It is also important to note whether or not you were fasting when the blood tests were done. One way to diagnosis diabetes is with two fasting blood sugar levels greater than 126.

Impaired glucose tolerance can be a stepping point to true diabetes.  Impaired glucose tolerance is a state where your body does not use insulin to metabolize glucose appropriately, but is still able to keep fasting glucose levels under control.  It is the post-prandial levels (glucose level 2 hours after eating) that are affected.  This can be tested with an oral glucose tolerance test.

You should follow up with you primary care physician to discuss the results, possible contributing factors to a false level, other symptoms that you may have, and further testing that should be obtained.  Your primary care physician may refer you to an endocrinologist."
"All the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but normal TSH?","I would definitely suggest going back to see your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> about these symptoms, which sound very complex! The first issue that you might want to address with your doctor is describing to them what kind of ""autoimmune disease"", exactly, you were treated for when you were a child. I say this because some of your symptoms might be consistent with an autoimmune disease, especially feeling fatigued and having your lips (or potentially other body parts?) turning blue from time to time. If your doctor knows the specific details of your history, they will be able to perform a more thorough evaluation. 

Also, a normal TSH does rule out most kinds of hypothyroidism, but it does not rule out a form of hypothyroidism known as central hypothyroidism. This can only be diagnosed with a full panel of thyroid function tests. So, if you have not had this done, this might be another area for your doctor to investigate. 

Seeing a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">psychotherapist</a> is a great idea. However, I do think that you deserve a more complete medical evaluation before chalking up all of your symptoms to a psychiatric condition. 

Make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss these issues!"
I have symptoms of thyroid problem. Why?,"It sounds like there have been several changes in your health recently, including some concerning symptoms with the falls and low blood pressure.  Certainly from that standpoint alone the best thing for you to do is see your physician right away for a thorough history and physical examination.

However, you also mention that you are having symptoms of a thyroid problem.  There can be many different symptoms of abnormal thyroid hormone levels, including changes in your skin and hair, palpitations, changes in your energy level, difficulty sleeping, as well as some possible findings on physical exam (nodules in your thyroid itself, sluggish or overactive reflexes, changes with your eyes).  If your physician is concerned that you may have a problem with your thyroid function, he or she can do a series of blood tests as well as consider an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> to evaluate the thyroid gland.  In general, the tests that evaluate thyroid function are not affected by whether or not you have eaten before the blood tests.

If it is not clear exactly what is going on with your thyroid--or if there are other associated changes in your health, such as the falls and low blood pressure you describe--you should definitely continue a thorough medical evaluation.  There are many reasons why someone can have problems with the thyroid, but the good news is that there are very good treatment options once you and your physician finish the evaluation.  Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> may also want to send you to an endocrine specialist. Good luck."
How can I lose about 30 pounds?,"From your question it sounds like you have recently gained weight and this is really bothering you.  Your goal of losing weight is a good one as it will undoubtedly help you feel better during the day but also help protect your health for the long term.  As you set up your <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> plan, it is also a good idea to see your physician.  He or she can help make sure you are physically ready to start exercising more and can help you continue to maintain good health in the meantime.

In general, losing weight requires your body to expend more calories each day than you take in.  In practical terms, that means you need to eat fewer calories than you burn each day--the difference adds up to weight loss.  From  a dietary perspective, you will want to make a careful not of what you are eating and how much you are eating.  Keeping a food diary and writing down everything that you eat can be an effective way of getting an idea when during the day you are over-eating.  You also want to talk with a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> about healthy food choices.  In general, you will want to stay away from processed foods and high-fat dairy or meat in favor of fruits and vegetables and lean protein.  In addition, you an also further your weight loss goals by exercise.  Even starting out with daily walking for 30-60 minutes a day and then building up to more vigorous aerobic exercise will help your metabolism increase and continue to help you lose weight. Again, please discuss with your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> before embarking on any changes, and good luck!"
Am I maturing normally?,"You should go see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or your adolescent <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> as soon as possible. 

There is a great deal of variation in how people progress through puberty, and for some people this may occur later than in others. However, you have raised multiple concerns, such as little pubic hair, little change in voice, and short height. All of these things may be related to trouble progressing through puberty, and so the first step would be to have an examination with your doctor. They can look at various characteristics, such as distribution of body hair, size of the testicles and penis, etc and help determine whether or not you are progressing. They can also ask some questions about your family, such as the height of your parents, to see if your height it appropriate or if there are any other clues that might uncover a problem. 

Based on what they find, they may want to perform some basic blood tests look at hormone levels in the blood. They may also decide to refer you to see an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinology specialist</a> if there are any concerning findings on the blood work or on the physical examination. Contact your doctor as soon as you can!"
Does PCOS affect getting pregnant?,"Your question raises a lot of questions of its own! First, I think it is important to clarify whether or not you had any abnormalities on your blood work or whether the only abnormality that was seen was cysts in your ovaries on the <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>. Also, it is important to clarify whether this is the very first time you have missed a period or whether you have a history of irregular periods previously. 

The reason I mention these two points is that cysts in the ovaries on ultrasound can be normal, especially in the absence of a history of menstrual irregularity. It is the combination of menstrual irregularity and cysts in the ovaries together that gives the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Those who have true polycystic ovarian syndrome do often have trouble getting pregnant, but this would not be necessarily the case if you have just missed this one period. 

The best thing to do would be to discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor in more detail. They can look over all of the results from the testing you just had done and help you decide whether this diagnosis fits the picture. "
"I'm 29, went to obgyn and she found that my thyroid glands were visibly enlarged. ","My answer to your question is going to contain the caveat that your description of your <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> is missing the units. For example, you say that the left nodule is 9 x 9. I am assuming that means millimeters. Generally speaking, thyroid nodules that are larger than 1 centimeter (10 millimeters) are the nodules that most need to be investigated. Therefore, your nodules are small, although the one in the left side is getting to the size that in might require additional investigation. 

You mention that your thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged, so probably the first thing that the endocrinology <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> will want to do, if your OB GYN didn't already do it, is perform a complete set of thyroid tests on your blood. These will help determine whether or not the enlargement might be from thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid, which can have several different causes. 

Then, your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> will want to talk with you about whether or not the thyroid nodules need to be biopsied to rule out cancer. The fact that they are on the small side argues against this, but the family history of thyroid cancer does raise your risk and might influence your endocrinologist to recommend a needle biopsy of the nodules. Please talk to your doctor right away."
Is my puberty delayed?,"In order to answer this question, it is important to know several important details that are missing. First of all: are you male or female? Timelines and features of puberty are very different in males and females. Based on the answer to this question, it is important to define what you mean by ""not reaching puberty."" For example, there is a big difference between ""not menstruating yet"" and ""not menstruating, but some breast formation and pubic hair."" The former suggests that hormones are in place, whereas the latter would be much more concerning. 

The first step, regardless of your answers to the above questions, would be to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> right away. They will take a look closely at your sexual development. For a female, this would include looking for armpit and pubic hair, look at the size and shape of the breasts, and asking about menstruation. For a male, this would include looking at armpit and pubic hair and measuring the size of the testicles and penis. Based on these findings, your primary care doctor will be able to figure out whether you need additional testing or, potentially, referral to an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinology specialist</a> at this time. "
I was diagnosed with an overactive thyroid - why is my doctor not treating me?,"The major blood test that is used to screen for thyroid problems is something call the TSH test. This is probably the test that your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> ordered when you told them that you were suffering from symptoms of palpitations and anxiety, which can be associated with an over active thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism. If the TSH test had come back very abnormal, then this would have been consistent with hyperthyroidism and would have required treatment. 

However, what is much more common is for the test to come back just slightly abnormal. In this case, it is hard to say if the palpitations or anxiety might be from the thyroid, since they are more likely to be from another cause. In this situation, the slightly abnormal test might indicate that you are in the process of developing hyperthyroidism and might eventually need treatment. Many <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctors</a> in this situation will choose just to ""watch and wait"" - following your symptoms and checking blood work periodically. They may also check some of the other thyroid function tests, such as T3 or T4, to see if there are abnormalities in those levels. 

I would talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue again, to get a better sense of exactly what they are thinking. "
What are the signs of not being able to have kids?,"Infertility is not an uncommon problem seen in the primary care setting; as many as 10-15 percent of couples in the U.S. are infertile, which is defined as the inability to conceive after a year of frequent unprotected sex. 

The first step in evaluation of an infertile couple is education regarding the ovulatory cycle of the woman and the optimal timing of intercourse to increase chances of fertilization. This involves review of the fact that ovulation typically occurs 14 days after the start of a woman's menstrual cycle, and that the couple should focus on having intercourse in the days around ovulation. In terms of factors contributing to infertility, men and women contribute at around equal rates. For men, sperm analysis can be conducted to check sperm count and motility. For women, tests can be done to ensure that ovulation is actually occurring on a monthly basis, and imaging with <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> may be conducted to evaluate the uterus and fallopian tubes. In about one-third of cases of infertility, no cause is found. However, even in these circumstances, treatments for infertility may be possible.

You should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about your difficulty conceiving, and your doctor can start a basic work-up and refer you to a <a href=""/procedure/ivf-reproductive-endocrinology-1284"">reproductive endocrinology</a> expert for further testing. "
Why are my feet cold inside but warm to the touch?,"I am very sorry to hear about these symptoms that you are experiencing, as they sound like they are really beginning to interfere with your quality of life and, especially, your sleep. 

I would recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> about this issue at your earliest convenience. It is probably best to start with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or which ever other doctor is primarily managing your diabetes. 

As you know, diabetes has many consequences which can affect different parts of your body. Related to your symptoms, there are two primary possibilities. One is that the diabetes is affecting the circulation of blood through your legs and feet. The other is that the diabetes has caused some damage to the nerves in your feet, leading to painful sensations. 

Your doctor should be able to tell the difference between these two possibilities with a careful physical exam (for example, feeling the pulses in your feet, testing you for impaired feeling on the bottoms of your feet, etc). The treatments for these two different possibilities are quite different, so determine which is the major player here is an important first step. 

Please make an appointment with your doctor at your earliest convenience!"
Is it dangerous for a Type 2 diabetic to take Metformin but not eat a diabetic diet?,"Diabetes is a serious medical condition. It is important that any diabetic patient work closely with their primary  care physician to manage this issue. If necessary, you may need to see a <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> (a diabetes specialist).

To answer your question, no, it is not necessarily dangerous to have metformin and not eat a diabetic diet. The metformin works by decreasing the amount of sugar released by the liver, thereby improving the average blood sugar in the body. However, unlike other medicines for diabetes, it does not remove sugar from the blood, therefore the risk for low blood sugar is not there.

That being said, there are a few other issues. One, diabetes is very important to manage with an appropriate diabetes. Talk to her <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> regarding this. Secondly, a major side effect of metformin is an upset stomach. Talk to your doctor if the metformin can be cause of the upset stomach. 

Diabetes can cause many problems if not properly addressed. Its unclear if the chronic upset stomach, raised lumps or mass are actually related. For example, diabetes can damage the stomach nerves and cause an upset stomach known as diabeteic gastroparesis.

Talk to your doctor. This is a complicated situation that require a careful treatment plan. Good luck!"
Does PCOS cause weight gain?,"PCOS (which stands for polycystic ovarian syndrome).  This is a complex endocrine disease that requires special attention from your doctors and possibly attention from a specialist.  The disease is named for what is found in the ovaries (small cysts), but these play little role in the condition's manifestations.  It turns out that PCOS is very directly related to weight gain.  Hormones that are secreted in increased amounts because of PCOS make it hard to keep the weight off.  The trouble is that weight gain also causes the other symptoms and associated conditions to get worse.  The other problems that you may be dealing with include irregular periods and diabetes.  Both of these conditions are seen in high prevalence in patients with PCOS.  Weight gain will make your periods more irregular and your diabetes more difficult to control.  Conversely, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> can improve these problems.  In addition to weight loss, the medication metformin can also be useful in making your periods more regular and your diabetes in better control (if you have these problems at all).  

I think you should consult with a specialist for your disease.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a>.  This is a <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> who can deal with the many different issues that PCOS can cause.  "
Can you have diabetes without showing any of the symptoms?,"As you probably know, the symptoms of overt diabetes include blurry vision, dry mouth, excessive appetite, and <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a>. All of these symptoms are caused by the high sugar levels in the blood. However, the elevation in the blood sugar tends to occur rather gradually over a long period of time, and it is certainly possible to have elevated sugar levels that are high enough to qualify as diabetes or pre-diabetes without being high enough to cause these classic symptoms yet. 

You are also right that being overweight puts you at greater risk of developing diabetes, as does a family history of diabetes. I suggest that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. At your <a href=""/procedure/annual-physical-76"">annual physical</a> examination, one of the most important things your doctor does is screen you for diabetes, and so if you have not had an annual examination in a while that might be a good place to start. 

In addition to screening your for diabetes, your doctor can also give you some advice on how you can modify your dietary habits and your exercise patterns to help you lose some weight and decrease your overall lifetime risk of developing diabetes. 

Good luck!"
Why am I cold all of the time?,"Feeling cold all of the time may be a problem with your thyroid. The thyroid gland is located in your neck and is responsible for producing the thyroid hormone which plays an important role in your body's metabolism, energy levels, and many other functions. 

When a patient has thyroid deficiency (hypothyroid), it may cause certain symptoms such as fatigue (feelings of being tired more than normal), and feeling of ""always being cold."" This is usually described as being independent of normal room temperature or weather. 

If you feel that you are always cold even when you shouldn't be (e.g. in a setting of warm room temperature and multiple layers of clothes), you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and undergo a workup for hypothyroidism. It is usually a matter of a simple blood test that can look at the levels of your circulating thyroid hormone in your blood. 

If your thyroid hormone levels are low, and your TSH (another hormone which promotes thyroid function) is high, you may need thyroid replacement with medication, such as synthroid.

Speak to your doctor regarding a workup for thyroid abnormalities. If all of your thyroid studies are normal, then your doctor can help look into other, less common causes for your symptoms. "
Is it safe to take Onglyza?,"Onglyza (saxagliptin) is a relatively new medication that is used to treat type 2 (adult onset diabetes). It has the advantage of being an oral medication, which means there are is no need for needles or injections. Saxagliptin is generally very well tolerated, and there are actually very few serious side effects. Of course, it is always possible to have a bad reaction to a new medication, but there is no reason that you should be more concerned about saxagliptin than any other new medication. When started slowly and under the supervision of a <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a>, most people tolerate the medication very well. 

Most commonly, saxagliptin is used as a second or third line medication in people who are already taking first line medications for diabetes but who still have elevated blood sugars. In this setting, you usually continue take the other medication as well, and the hope is that the combination of medications will be more effective at lowering blood sugar than one medication alone. Also, saxagliptin is sometimes used alone in people who had bad side effects with the first line medications, which sounds like might be your situation. 

I suggest that you talk to your doctor about your concerns about the new medication; they will be happy to address all your concerns and support you through the process of starting the new medication. "
Can stress cause your blood sugar to be elevated?,"Although you don't explicitly say it in the question, it sounds like you are probably diabetic and are trying to control your blood sugar in that context. 

Stress hormones can indeed cause the blood sugar to go up, and this is commonly a probably for diabetics when they get sick, especially type 1 diabetics. However, the amount of 'stress' required to raise the blood sugar levels is usually only produced by <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>. Normal stress, such as from being busy at work, is typically not significant enough to raise the blood sugar. 

Therefore, I suggest that you go to see either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or whichever doctor is helping you managing your diabetes. It is important to get your blood sugar under control before it continues to rise and becomes a serious problem. Your doctor will work with you to adjust your insulin or medication regimen to get your blood sugar down and they will also work with you to figure out what the trigger of the high sugars was and, if needed, treat it. 

If you cannot get in to see your doctor right away and if you have severe symptoms, such as <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, blurry vision, or dehydration you should go to the emergency room for treatment. "
What is the best form of daily exercise?,"Kudos to you for taking charge of your health by a thoughtful evaluation of your weight and activity level.  You are absolutely correct that being overweight can have significant adverse effects on your overall health and energy level.  Maintaining a healthy weight will help you stay active and engaged with life in the decades to come.  Before starting a new exercise regiment, it is always a good idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  Given your age you are at a slightly increased risk of cardiac or joint problems, and it is always a good idea to make sure that you are cleared for activity and up to date on all of your screening exams.  Your physician may even be able to refer you to <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> or nutrition programs, as some medical practices have these resources available for patients.  When it comes to exercise, the best way to lose weight and improve your cardiac health is regular aerobic exercise: this can be walking, hiking, running, riding a bike, swimming, using the stair climber at the gym, dancing....anything that gets your heart rate up and maintains it there.  Choosing the right activity for you is a question of what sort of activity you enjoy the most. Again, please discuss with your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> soon - and best of luck with this important decision to help improve your health!"
Does Methimazole cause you to gain weight ?,"As you stated, methimazole is a medication that is used to help people that have hyperthyroidism.  It acts by decreasing the amount of active thyroid hormone levels in the body.  It is also true that people that have too much thyroid hormone (such as yourself) are more likely to lose weight than gain weight.  The reverse is true (people with low thyroid are more likely to gain weight).  Thus, anyone that is placed on this medication is likely to gain weight.  The important question is if you are getting too much f the methimazole.  The answer to that question lies in the blood test for the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH test).  The TSH test is done to see if someone is hyperthyroid or hypothyroid (too little thyroid hormone).  Your TSH when you were hyperthyroid was too low.  Now that you are on methimazole, it will be higher.  You just have to make sure that you and your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> haven't overshot and caused hypothyroidism (with a high TSH).  The only way to find this out is to get it tested.  If your TSH is normal, then the methimzole dose is correct and should not be adjusted.  Only your endocrinologist will know the answer to this question.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment to work out these issues.  "
Are you born with diabetes or do you get in later in life?,"What we normally think of as one disease, diabetes, is usually divided into two separate types.  Recently, the two types of diabetes have come under new names: type one and type two, but for a very long time they were more frequently referred to as juvenile diabetes and adult-onset diabetes.

Generally speaking diabetes signifies a body’s inability to adequate regulate blood sugar or glucose levels.  The main organ charged with regulating blood sugar levels is the pancreas and it does this by a number of mechanisms, but the most important one is through secreting insulin.
In truth, very few people are “born with” diabetes, but those that do have what is called type one or juvenile diabetes actually develop it in childhood.  This type of diabetes results from the pancreas’s inability to effectively secrete insulin.  And without insulin sugar levels rise very high causing damage to various organs and also keeping the body from appropriately using the sugar for energy.  Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes is more related to a body’s inability to appropriately use the insulin that is secreted; someone with diabetes actually becomes “insulin-resistant.”

Unlike, type one diabetes, type two diabetes is, in fact, related to obesity.  As people become more and more overweight they generally become more and more resistant to insulin and consequently blood sugar levels rise.  Eventually, they can become so resistant to insulin that their sugars stay high enough and they develop diabetes.  If this continues for many years the pancreas can stop making insulin altogether very similar to type one diabetes.  Your friend is correct that being overweight increases your chances, but the good news is that losing weight can also help prevent it or even reverse diabetes.  In fact, this is one of the best things you can do.  Your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> can check your average blood sugar level by measuring your hemoglobin A1c and let you know how close you are to developing the disease.  You should talk with your primary care provider more about this and he/she may be able to help you lose weight regardless of your sugar levels.  Good luck!
"
How can I improve my bone strength?,"In young, otherwise healthy people who are very physically active, broken bones are not entirely uncommon. For example, it is common for those who play contact sports to get broken bones, and this does not necessarily mean that there is anything 'weak' about their bones; the breaks are just an unfortunate side effect of the injuries that they have sustained. 

However, every case of recurrent broken bones at least deserves a good checkup by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Although most cases of multiple broken bones are not related to a medical problem, as I said, there are some medical conditions that can make the bones weaker. For example, people who take steroid medications for inflammatory conditions are at higher risk of osteoporosis and breaking bones. There are also some genetic conditions that predispose to broken bones, so your doctor may ask you about your family history. 

If nothing turns up, you should be reassured that this was probably just bad luck. Nevertheless, your doctor will give you some advice on how to promote good bone health, such as by increasing your dietary intake of calcium. If there are concerns, your doctor will probably want to order a bone density study. Please talk to your doctor soon!"
Does obesity run in the family the same way that diseases do?,"Obesity is a major worldwide epidemic that is related to an accumulation in body fat over time due to a difference between energy consumption versus expenditure in terms of calories. It is a major healthcare problem due to its association with various other medical problems not limited to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, and even some cancers. 
Genes definitely do play a role in the development of obesity. It is believed that the genetic variation combined with the variations in environmental conditions are responsible for the increase in obesity. Studies have found an association between genes seen more commonly in obese patients as compared to people who are not obese. Thus to answer your question, yes, obesity can run in families depending on your clinical situation and on many other factors that science is yet to clearly decipher.
In order to determine how to plan for a healthy child, it is important that you and your wife make an appointment with your <a href=""/family-physicians"">family physician</a> or gynecologist to determine how to get in good health and how to ensure your child is healthy as well. Your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctors</a> will be able to take a detailed history and provide strategies to avoid any excess weight gain. They will also be able to provide dietary choices and provide physical activity recommendations to help reduce the risk of obesity to you, and to your family. "
Can Graves Disease cause short-term memory loss?,"As you probably know, Graves disease is a condition where the thyroid gland is stimulated to make to much thyroid hormone.  Symptoms of Graves disease include insomnia, a tremor, feeling hot all the time, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, and depression.  Dementia is typically not a symptom of having too much thyroid hormone.  Dementia can be a sign of having too little thyroid hormone.  Keep in mind that some of the symptoms of depression can seem like dementia.  Short term memory loss is definitely one of them.  Often after the Graves disease is properly treated, the symptoms of depression can subside.  If your father has other signs of depression, he should be evaluated by a physician.  

The best physician for your father to see is an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> (who are the experts in Graves disease).  I suggest that your father schedule an appointment with his endocrinologist with his new symptoms in mind.  If his <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> has evaluated him in the past, he will be able to make a call as to whether his short term memory has been compromised.  In addition, his doctor will want to measure his thyroid hormone levels to make sure that his Graves disease is under control.  This may include some combination of medications, a surgery or a thyroid gland ablation.  "
Could someone have diabetes and not know it?,"Yes, it is quite common for patients to not know that they have diabetes and find out about this only by routine <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> visits and laboratory tests. Obesity is the one of the leading causes of diabetes. Obesity is also a risk factor for various other conditions including high blood pressure, high lipid levels, metabolic problems with insulin resistance and can affect cardiovascular health. Obesity can also increase the risk of musculoskeletal issues like aches and pains, breathing problems and other nonspecific symptoms. There are various different symptoms of diabetes. Most common symptoms of this are problems with increased urination, feeling thirsty or hungry a lot, tiredness or fatigue, frequent infections, change in vision, poor wound healing and changes in sensation, tingling or numbness of the legs or hands. 

Patients who are over 45, having a family history of diabetes, overweight, do not exercise are at risk of developing diabetes. 

If you are concerned your mother has any of the above symptoms or is feeling sick very often, she should make an appointment to see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> immediately. Her doctor can provide more information, take a detailed medical history, run laboratory tests to make an accurate diagnosis. Obesity and diabetes, both, have significant long term complications, and therefore, it is best for your mother to see a physician about her symptoms as soon as possible to get appropriate treatment "
Is a low sperm count or infertility a permanent problem for men?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having problems becoming pregnant. Nearly half of cases of infertility are caused by problems with the male's sperm, so I am not surprised to hear that your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> has told your husband that he has a low sperm count. 

Low sperm count, or <a href=""/procedure/male-infertility-1258"">male infertility</a>, can be caused by three different types of factors, pre-testicular factors, testicular factors, or post-testicular factors. Pre-testicular factors are environmental and medical conditions outside the testicle that impact sperm production. Testicular factors are problems with the testicle itself, and post testicular factors are problems with sperm exiting. A thorough medical evaluation by a fertility specialist is required to identify which problem your husband has. 

Pre-testicular factors can often be treated. For example, avoiding sperm damaging medications, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and avoiding strenuous activities like bicycle riding can help. In other words, pre-testicular factors are often not permanent but rather curable when the cause is identified. 

Testicular and post testicular factors are much harder to treat, however. Often, men whose infertility stems from these causes will need an invasive fertility method in order to conceive. 

Your <a href=""/reproductive-endocrinologist"">fertility doctor</a> can help work you through these various potential problems and treatment options. "
What does it mean if my eyes are sticking out more than usual?,"First of all, I would make sure that the feeling that your eyes are sticking out more than usual is not an optical illusion from having, for example, large circles under your eyes or eye allergies that are causing your eyes to turn red. If so, then it is likely that treating the underlying problem will make your eyes seem less prominent. 

On the other hand, if you don't have either dark circles or eye allergies/red eyes, then one possible medical condition that needs to be ruled out is Grave's disease. This is a condition in which the body's immune system provokes the thyroid gland to be overactive. This can lead to palpitations, sweating, nervousness, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> and other related symptoms. Cross reaction in the immune response between the tissue behind the eye and in the thyroid gland causes swelling and inflammation and makes the eyes appear to 'bug out.' If you have symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland such as those I just mentioned, then you should definitely see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to perform some simple blood tests to rule out Grave's disease; if the tests are positive, they will be able to suggest treatment. "
What are the usual signs of diabetes?,"Diabetes, as you know, is a condition in which the body loses its ability to regulate blood sugar levels well. Most cases of diabetes are type two diabetes, which is caused when the body becomes relatively resistant to the action of insulin, the hormone that control blood sugar levels. Type two diabetes is more common in those who are overweight, as being overweight is one of the factors that contributes to insulin resistance. 

Symptoms of diabetes are symptoms are having high blood sugar. Some of the most common symptoms include feeling thirsty all the time, feeling hungry all the time, and having to urinate very frequently. Other symptoms may include fatigue, blurry vision, and <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>. 

Granted these symptoms are not specific for diabetes as they can be caused by many other things. For example in your case, it is very possible that you feel like you have to drink water constantly because you are getting dehydrated from the exercise. Feels shaky after exercising could also be a sign of dehydration or it could be a sign of workout out too hard and being too fatigued. 

However, it is definitely worth talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about the possibility of having diabetes and getting a complete medical checkup for yourself. "
How can I have low body fat while keeping my breasts?,"This is a very difficult question to answer, because the body fat distribution of every person is different and the breasts are composed of fatty tissue in large part. Depending on the age of a woman, the percentage of the breasts that are composed of fat will vary as well, with older women having breasts with more fatty tissue, and younger women having a higher relative amount of other tissue. The breasts have fat, ductal tissue, and the milk secreting glands which make up the majority of the breast mass. During pregnancy and other times when certain hormones increase, the amount of ductal and milk producing glands will increase, but this is obviously temporary. With both men and women, it is difficult to ""target"" fat loss so that it comes from just one area (despite the numerous claims that it can be done by so many diets and fad exercise plans). This means that, if you lose fat from the rest of your body, it is likely to come from your breasts as well. Please speak to your family practice <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> if you continue to have questions, and to get more tips for successful <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, if it is appropriate. "
How can I grow my breasts?,"Puberty starts when extra amounts of chemicals called hormones are produced in the body.  These hormones guide the physical and emotional changes that take place in the body.  As you know already, the beginning of breast development is one of the earliest signs of puberty.  The main hormones involved are estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and corticosteroids that drive the development and maintenance of breast tissue, causing fat to be deposited in the breast and the milk ducts to grow. If all of these hormones are released in the proper amounts, it should usually result in the breasts growing to average or normal size.  As such, it is important to eat a healthy diet to ensure that your body can develop as it is supposed and help maintaining the hormonal balance.  However, every woman is different and her own pattern of growth is pre-determined by her genes which dictate how large her breasts can get.

How can you grow breasts?  Unfortunately, as discussed that hormones mostly regulate breast development and growth, there are no reliable means of increasing your breast size other than breast implants or hormone treatments, both of which can carry serious health risks.  I strongly advise that you schedule an appointment with a primary <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> to have your hormone level checked out and to evaluate appropriate treatments.  "
Should my child have a weight loss consultation if she's lost a lot of weight recently?,"It is good that you are aware of your daughter's weight and are involved enough to notice the weight loss that she has been having. No matter the initial weight of your daughter, 20 lbs of weight loss in 2 months is a good reason to be seen by a physician. Weight loss can indicate many things (from metabolic disorders to <a href=""/procedure/digestive-problem-1452"">digestive problems</a>), but one of the most common problems in teenage girls involves eating disorders. Bulimia (involving binge eating followed by ""purging,"" which involves self inflicted <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>) and anorexia (unhealthy abstinence from food) are both very common in teenage girls. While it is very important to speak with your daughter's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about the weight loss, it is also important that you, as a parent, engage in conversations with her about her weight. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are important to long term health, and being overweight can also affect the self esteem of many individuals. Achieving the ideal weight through unhealthy means, such as purging or anorexia, are very unhealthy, however, and can be signs of a young person that needs your help. Please speak with your daughter's pediatrician soon, and also discuss these issues with your daughter. "
How are thyroid evaluations performed?,"The thyroid is a gland located in the neck and is responsible for secreting thyroid hormone. The regulation of amount of thyroid that is secreted is based on amount of thyroid levels in the blood as well as levels of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) which regulate how much thyroid hormone is released. Dietary Iodine is needed to make thyroid hormone (often found in seafood and iodinated salt. 

Thyroid evaluations start with a good medical history and physical examination. After that, blood is drawn to look for levels of thyroid hormone, as well as TSH levels in the blood. Low TSH levels may suggest hyperhtyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), whereas High TSH levels may be found when not enough thyroid hormone is produces (hypothyroidism). 

Frequently included in the workup is an ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland. If an abnormal cyst or nodule is detected, this may need to be sampled with a needle -- a procedure called ""Fine Needle Aspiration"" or FNA. That sample is then sent to a <a href=""/pathologists"">pathologist</a> who will look at it under a microscope and determine if it is normal or abnormal thyroid tissue. 

Based on all of these tests and results, the proper diagnosis and treatment can be proposed by your physician. 

I recommend consulting an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> or an Endocrine <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> for evaluation of your thyroid. "
How successful is thyroid cancer?,"It sounds as though you are asking a question about the success of <a href=""/procedure/thyroid-cancer-1148"">thyroid cancer treatment</a>.  The best person with whom to discuss this question is the physician (probably a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>) who handled your thyroid <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>.  He or she can provide the specific information about the type of tumor that you had and any follow-up you will need.

Overall, thyroid cancer is very treatable if caught early.  It is also not particularly unusual in a younger age group, including patients such as yourself.  The most important thing is to catch the disease at an early enough stage that it can be surgically removed without any spread to other parts of the body.  There is only one subtype of thyroid cancer (called anaplastic thyroid cancer) that carries a poor prognosis since this type of tumor has often spread by the time of diagnosis.  However, the most common types of thyroid tumors--including those most often found in patients your age--have an excellent overall prognosis.  

As you probably know, you will likely need to be on replacement thyroid hormone for the rest of your life to make up for the normal thyroid tissue that was taken out along with your tumor.  However, that is not a problem for most patients."
Is a prolactinoma related to cancer?,"A <a href=""/procedure/prolactinoma-and-other-pituitary-problems-379"">prolactinoma</a> is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland.  It is not a cancer that typically becomes malignant, but it is an overgrowth of cells.  They are actually quite common.  They develop from cells in the pituitary gland (which is just outside the brain) that normally make the hormone prolactin.  Prolactin is a hormone that is responsible for milk production in the breasts.  It is secreted in high amounts when a women is in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and while a mother is breast feeding.  A prolactinoma contains more of these cells and thus, you will have a higher level of prolactin in your blood.  Symptoms of a prolactinoma include galactorrhea (milk production), menstrual cycle irregularities, and occasionally difficulty getting pregnant.  All of these effects are treatable with medications, or in some cases surgery.

If the prolactinoma gets large enough, it can compress structures in the brain including the optic nerve.  This can cause vision problems that usually manifest as tunnel vision.  In these cases, the prolactinoma should be removed surgically.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a>.  This is a specialist that has done extra training in endocrine system disorders, which is what a prolactinoma is.  The two of you can discuss the severity of your prolactinoma, and the best treatment in your particular case.  Good luck.  "
Do I need a preventive medicine consultation to keep my weight down?,"While it sounds obvious, best kind of doctor to help with your weight is the kind of doctor that can help you to lose weight. At the forefront of this quest will be your relationship with your primary care doctor, who can help you organize appointments and treatment strategies that will be most effective with you. 

After discussing the problem with him or her, your doctor may recommend a visit to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> to discuss your current eating habits, which could then be altered as needed. Alternatively, and depending on the state of your overall health, the source of the extra weight, and how much extra weight you are carrying, your primary care doctor may also recommend visits to <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologists</a>, psychiatrists, and even to bariatric <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeons</a>. 

Given the diverse options available and the fact that there is no perfect solution for weight loss that is the same for all people, your primary care is likely the best place to start. He or she will stress that the best weight loss is sustainable. This will usually eliminate the fad diets and extremes that can often come with them. An open discussion about improving your health by losing weight will be welcomed by your PCP, so please speak with them soon. "
Is my deep voice due to polycystic ovaries?,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complicated disease that involves problems with the endocrine system and female reproductive system.  The actual cysts in the ovaries are incidental and are only a marker of the disease, not a cause of the disease.  PCOS is a syndrome that can cause irregular periods, difficulty getting pregnant, weight gain, diabetes, and symptoms of too many androgen hormones (called hyperandrogenism) such as a deeper voice, and facial hair growth.  The part of the syndrome that is caused by too many androgen hormones may be what is causing your lower voice.  There are ways to control these symptoms and reduce the long term complications of PCOS.  The management of PCOS often involves medication, weight control, and sometimes the use of hormonal birth control pills.  

Since you are showing signs of hyperandrogenism, I suggest that you see a PCOS specialist.  A good physician for you to schedule an appointment with is an <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a>.  This type <a href=""/endocrinologists"">doctor</a> will be best equipped to handle all of your endocrine system issues including diabetes (if you have this), being overweight, and excess androgens.  There are medications that many <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physicians</a> and OBGYNs may not be used to prescribing that can help your situation.  Good luck.  "
Are polycystic ovaries a sign of cancer?,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) can be an overwhelming diagnosis.  Your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> can help manage your condition and answer questions in terms of prognosis and possible complications.

PCOS is one of the main causes of abnormal ovulation and increased androgen (male hormone) symptoms in women.  This syndrome is a spectrum of disease but the primary characteristics include hyperandrogenism (symptoms of increased testosterone such as increased hair and <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>), irregular menstrual cycles, <a href=""/procedure/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-metabolic-syndrome-1453"">polycystic ovaries</a>, obesity, and insulin resistance.  It is important to keep in mind that PCOS is a syndrome and each patient will present differently with varying combinations of these primary characteristics.  Because of this, it is often difficult to diagnose.

PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women.  The other main complications include Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and possible cardiovascular disease.  Specific treatment is aimed at a patient's symptoms.  For menstrual irregularity oral contraceptive pills are often used.  It is important to treat this aspect of PCOS because persistent anovulation can increase the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasis which is subsequently linked to carcinoma.  However, polycystic ovaries are not in themselves a cancer risk; the increased risk comes from not having regular menstruation which can be treated with birth control pills.

PCOS can be a scary diagnosis but your endocrinologist can help discuss management and possible complications.  The increased cancer risk does not apply to patient who are adequately treated for their menstrual irregularity."
What's the best way to narrow my stomach?,"This is a question that should be addressed with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, as the answer will vary depending on factors that are unique to you. For example, some people feel that they need to lose weight very quickly, but are actually very close to their ideal weight. Others are morbidly obese, meaning that their size is significantly impacting their ability to perform routine tasks of daily life and is contributing greatly to an overall worse quality of life. For these people, something as drastic as bariatric <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> may be the best approach. 

For the majority of people, however, simple changes in diet and exercise are sufficient to help achieve and sustain a healthy weight. Given all of the variables that need to be addressed, your primary care doctor is in the best position to answer the question about which approach works best for you. An open and frank conversation about your weight will potentially yield multiple approaches that can be entertained, and you can then choose what works best for you. Losing weight as part of a healthy lifestyle is a very commendable decision that can bear fruits of good health for the rest of your life. Please speak with your doctor. "
Is double diabetes the same as type 3 diabetes?,"Double diabetes is the term often given for the condition when a person with Type 1Diabetes Mellitus (DM) develops insulin resistance, usually from obesity, and in effect has Type 1 DM complicated by Type 2 DM. There is no set definition of Type 3 diabetes and this term has been used to describe various different conditions including ""double diabetes"", gestational diabetes (DM related to pregnancy), and general insulin resistance.  You should speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> to discuss your specific situation and management options.

Diabetes Mellitus is a condition in which glucose is not metabolized correctly and results in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).  There are two main types - Type 1 and Type 2.  Type 1 DM is due to destruction of the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin, resulting in an absolute insulin deficiency.  This is most commonly autoimmune in nature.  It is usually diagnosed in childhood, but these is also an adult onset variety of Type 1 DM.  Type 2 DM is the most common form of diabetes and is due to a combination of both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance (when your body needs more insulin to have the same effect on blood glucose levels.)  Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreatic beta cells and is essential in the metabolism of glucose.  Without insulin, glucose cannot be used by the body and builds up in the blood.  Type 2 DM is highly related to excess weight and obesity.  Thus, the term ""double diabetes"" often refers to patients with Type 1 DM who then develop insulin resistance or Type 2 DM.  Treatment many be more difficult, but will likely involve insulin supplementation as well as diet and lifestyle changes.  Oral hypoglycemics may also be considered.

You should speak with your endocrinologist regarding your diagnosis and possible treatment options.
"
What life changes do I have to make once diagnosed with type 2 diabetes?,"A diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) can be frustrating and overwhelming.  You should speak to your <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> about your diagnosis, management, and possible complications.  You can definitely still eat dinner with your family, though the amount of food and types of choices might change. 

Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition in which glucose is not metabolized correctly and results in hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels).  Type 2 DM is the most common form of diabetes and is due to a combination of both insulin deficiency and insulin resistance (meaning your body needs more insulin to have the same effect on blood glucose levels).  Insulin is a hormone that is made and secreted by the pancreatic beta cells and is essential in the metabolism of glucose.  Without insulin, glucose cannot be used by the body and builds up in the blood.  Type 2 DM is highly related to excess weight and obesity.  Having a sedentary lifestyle with minimal exercise and an unbalanced diet can make DM worse.  

Of course you can continue to eat with your family, but you should try to make healthy food choices and include all food groups while decreasing your intake of sugary ""junk food"".  Obesity itself causes more insulin resistance, so <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> is beneficial for patients with Type 2 DM.  On that same note, exercise itself actually improves insulin resistance.  In short, other than medications (which you should discuss with your physician), the best lifestyle changes for patients with DM are a healthy well balanced diet, weight loss (especially if obese), and regular exercise.  You should follow up with your endocrinologist to discuss your diagnosis of Type 2 DM, lifestyle changes, and possible need for medications and glucose monitoring."
What is the best way to trim your toenails?,"Ingrown toenails occur when the lateral part of the toenail (normally the great toe) grows into the flesh of the toe. This can cause pain, inflammation and my become infected. If you're experiencing this, you should definitely see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> right away. Prevention is key and can normally be achieved with the twofold approach of proper grooming and well-fitting shoes. Proper grooming consists of trimming the nails straight across after they have cleared the fleshy aspects of the toe. To put it simply, do not cut your nails too short and do not cut them with a curving angle. tight fitting shoes should also be avoided as the compression of the front of the shoe can predispose to ingrown nails. If you feel you have an ingrown toenail, soaking it several times a day with soapy water or epsom salts while gently trying to 'free' the entrapped end of the nail can be effective. If this does not work, or if the area becomes increasingly red and swollen with purulent discharge (pus) you should be seen by a physician for further evaluation and possible removal of the entrapped portion of nail.  If, despite the aforementioned preventative steps, you continue to have recurrent ingrown toenails, you made need a minor <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to permanently remove a small portion of your nail. Hope this helps!"
Can symptoms for a sprained ankle stick around for 3 months?,"I'm sorry to hear that you are still dealing with this issue from 3 months ago. A sprain, as you likely know, is an injury to the ligaments that surround and stabilize a joint, commonly the ankle, although all the other joints can be sprained as well. 

Sprains can take a really long time to heal. This is in part because ongoing use of the joint may slow healing. It is also due to the fact that blood supply to ligaments is pretty low, which further delays healing. All in all, it is not at all uncommon still to have symptoms several months out from a bad sprain. 

That being said, I would definitely recommend medical followup at this point. Your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor, for example, can look at the the ankle to see if there is any evidence of a more severe or persistent injury, such as a torn ligament (rather than just a sprain). Sometimes, it may be necessary to be referred to a specialist, such as an orthopedic doctor, because severe sprains or ligament tears that are not healing properly will occasionally require <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>. At this point, if your symptoms are still severe, your doctors may want an MRI to get a better look at what is going on inside the ankle. "
Why is my foot is swollen and sore?,"While it is unclear what exactly may have caused this pain and swelling, it certainly is not normal and should be evaluated by a <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a>.

Some things may make this even more urgent, such as if you have a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or any other chronic conditions that may make healing of your lower extremities more difficult. Regardless, if your condition persists, you should speak to a doctor. You will need to be able to provide him or her with some idea of a timeline, as well as any thoughts that you may have about what might have started the swelling. Trauma or <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the area would certainly be relevant, and may explain all of your symptoms. Allergies or bites can also present in this area. The fact that it is on the top of your foot does make it seem more likely to be traumatic than anything else, however. The nice thing to know is that your doctor should be able to help make things feel better quite quickly if you are able to provide the appropriate information. Please speak to your doctor about your concerns to be able to get it taken care of in the right way."
How would I know if the tendon tore?,"Tendonitis is a really tough condition, because the blood supply to the tendons is quite limited, meaning that healing occurs very slowly. This healing is also slowed by repetitive injury or overuse of the tendon. Therefore, if you find that things are not getting better after an entire year, then it is definitely time to go see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> again for follow-up appointment. 

You could see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to start with, or you could set up a visit with an orthopedic specialist or with a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> (assuming the pain is limited to the foot itself). In addition to examining the area, they may want to repeat some testing, such as another x-ray or MRI scan, to evaluate the old broken bone for healing and also take a look for swelling in or around the tendons. 

Based on what they find, they will be able to make recommendations for treatment. These recommendations will almost certainly involve stopping any form of high-impact exercise on the foot, which will prevent healing. They also may recommend special footwear or anti-inflammatory medications. Very severe cases may require consideration of a surgical procedure. 

Make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as you can."
Two nails on one toe?,"I would recommend that you show this to your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor the next chance that you get. There are a few different possibilities here and your doctor will be able to help you figure things out. 

For example, one of the most common causes of a 'double nail' like this would be prior trauma to the nail bed (such as stubbing your toe). Sometimes, the double nail will grow out and resolve over time, where as other times the nail bed may be permanently damaged, resulting in a permanent double nail. In more severe cases, your primary care doctor may want you to see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> (foot specialist) to see if any additional interventions would be needed. 

Another possibility is that could represent an fungal infection of the nail. Fungal organisms can penetrate deep under the nail, where they can cause deformities of the nail as well as thickening of the nail and changes in color. If this does turn out to be a fungal infection of the nail, it will probably need a prescription oral anti fungal medication to help it clear up prescribed by your doctor. 

Start by contacting your doctor's office to set up a visit!

What should I do about this toe injury?,"This sounds like a dreadful accident!  In the big picture, the good news is that toenails almost always grow back, so hopefully within a few months your husband's toe will look normal again.  However, in your current situation, the best thing is for him to be evaluated in an urgent care setting to determine if he needs any x-rays and what kind of dressing would be best for the toe to protect it until the nail grows back.  The small bones in the toes are easily broken, and if the <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> was sufficient to rip off a nail, it will be important to determine that there is not a small <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> in the toe.  In addition, the biggest risk for your husband at the moment is infection.  If there are any fragments of wood or dirt in the wound they will need to be thoroughly washed out, and it is possible that upon examining the area, a physician may want to administer antibiotics.  A topical antibiotic cream may also be recommended, along with some pain medication.  Overall it is most likely that your husband will be fine, but what seems like a minor accident like this becomes a much bigger problem if signs suggestive of infection or fracture are missed in the beginning. If your primary care office does not have an urgent care appointment, the local emergency department will be able to evaluate this kind of injury."
Why does my foot hurt after my injury from a year ago?,"From the description of your injury, recovery, and now recurrent pain, it sounds like the best thing for you to do is to see the orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who treated your original injury.  You could also see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for assistance finding a new orthopedic specialist.  There are many possible reasons for why your foot would be hurting now, and a thorough evaluation and history by an orthopedic specialist is the first step towards figuring out why.  In addition, it is quite possible that your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> may want to do some more specialized imaging of your foot and ankle.  However, in order to decide if that would be helpful, he or she will need to take a look at your ankle.  

As you are discovering, once ligaments (the connective tissue that connects two bones) or tendons (the connective tissue that connects bone to muscle) are injured, it is very easy for the old injury to 'flare.'  Even minor activity, something you may not even remember, could have 'tweaked' the ligament you injured a year ago.  It is also possible that you have a new injury in another part of your foot.  The throbbing and aching feeling with difficulty weight-bearing you describe can sometimes be consistent with stress fractures.  Hopefully your doctor can help you get to the bottom of why your foot is still bothering you!"
What could explain my foot pain?,"You should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> for help with this issue. There are a few different causes of the type of pain you are experiencing, and they will be able to help you figure out what to do next. 

The most common cause of pain in the sole of the foot is something called plantar fasciitis, which is an inflammation of the connective tissue in the sole of the foot just in front of the heel bone. This is typically not caused by an <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> but, rather, from over use or strain, say from wearing shoes without good arch support or from standing on your feet all day long. 

Other common causes of foot pain in this location include bone spurs on the heel bone and flat arches. 

All three causes of foot pain are generally treated in the same way. This involves, first, switching over completely to good shoes with supportive arches. Additionally, stretching exercises to stretch out the Achilles tendon and strengthen the muscles in the arch of the foot are important. Finally taking a good anti inflammatory medication like ibuprofen will help with immediate pain relief. 

See your doctor as soon as you can to start your treatment!"
Are cortisone shots the best way to deal with plantar fasciitis?,"Plantar fasciitis is a condition in which the connective tissue on the bottom of the foot in front of the heel bone becomes inflamed. This is generally an over use <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, caused by poorly supporting shoes or standing on your feet for prolonged periods of time. It is also more common in those with abnormalities of the foot arch, such as low arches (""flat feet"") or in over pronators (a common problem in some runners). 

There are several different ways to deal with plantar fasciitis, starting from most simple and going towards least simple. To start with, most <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> will recommend switching away entirely from any sort of shoe that does not have good arch support. In addition to this, refraining from vigorous physical activity while things heal up is important, and taking an anti inflammatory medication like ibuprofen can relieve the pain. 

If these measures do not work, then it is common to try some stretching exercises to relieve tightness in the achilles tendon and strengthening exercises to improve the tone of muscles in the foot arch. 

Finally, if these do not work, then things like cortisone injections are commonly employed. 

Therefore, the answer to your question depends a lot on how severe your symptoms are and what you have already tried! Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for help deciding what to do next. "
What is this painful lump in my foot?,"There are several possibilities here. I think the fact that the swelling is better is an excellent sign, although the persistent pain should probably be evaluated. You could talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about the issue, especially if the symptoms persist. They can examine your foot for any signs of a serious problem. 

The most common cause of bumps on the bottom of the foot would include a callus, caused by friction of the skin from tight shoes or some similar trauma. A callus can periodically be very painful, especially if you put a great deal of pressure on it (say, from standing on your feet all day long). This could lead to some mild swelling and redness, which would likely subside over night as you rested. Similarly, a plantar wart on the sole of the foot could cause a reddened, painful, or swollen lump on the bottom of the foot, which could likewise periodically swell more and be more noticeable. 

Both of these problems can be treated in part by wearing comfortable, well fitting shoes. Additionally, however, they sometimes require shaving, freezing, or other treatments to relieve the pressure, and this is something either your <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> or primary care doctor can help with. Please speak with them soon!"
Anything I can do about a hammer toe?,"Sorry to hear this is a problem for you. Most of the time, hammer toe is a problem that develops chronically over time due to wearing shoes that are too tight or that poorly fit. Often, simpler cases of hammer toe can be corrected or at least relieved by changing the types of shoes that your wear. 

However, in your case, since the problem has been going on for quite a while, I would recommend seeking medical help. You should see your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor first, as sometimes hammer toe is a symptom of a previously undiagnosed problem with the nerves and muscles in the legs. Your doctor can examine your legs closely to make sure there is no evidence of this, such as weakness of the muscles of the feet.

Afterwards, you will likely also want to see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> or an orthopedic doctor specializing in feet. They can help you decide what type of shoes to wear to prevent discomfort. They may also suggest surgery, which is one definitive way to permanently correct the hammer toe. 

Start by making an appointment with your doctors at your earliest possible convenience. I am certain that they will be able to help you!"
What should I do for the blister on the side of my foot?,"I am sorry to hear about this issue, as it sounds quite painful! If you find that the blister is not healing up, then you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> for evaluation and help getting the issue under control. 

As you no doubt know, a blister forms essentially from pressure and rubbing on an area of skin. This leads to separation of the superficial and deep layers of the skin, with an accumulation of clear fluid between them which produces the blister. 

The major way to treat a blister is to immediately remove the source of pressure that caused its formation in the first place. Most of the time what this means is that you have to stop wearing the pair of shoes that caused the problem and switch to a more sensible, comfortable pair. Additionally, you may want to cover the blistered area with moleskin or a foam donut to further reduce pressure and allow healing (you can buy this products in any pharmacy). 

In any case, you should also go see your doctor to rule out any serious issues. If there is any evidence of infection of the blistered area, you should seek immediate treatment. "
Do I have a circulation problem?,"Pain in one of your toes is probably not likely to be caused by a circulation problem.  The only way this could be a circulation problem is if you developed a blood clot in one of your arteries that moved down to the pinky toe.  This would cause pain, but then the toe would turn white and eventually die.  Pain without any of these other changes would be caused by disruptions in blood flow.  Blood flow to the feet can be impaired by diseases such as diabetes.  If you have diabetes, you will need to insure that you take very good care of your feet to prevent any ulcers or sores from forming.  These disruptions in blood flow due to diabetes can be painful depending on the presence any accompanying nerve damage.  However, this pain would not be in one toe.  More than likely, your pain is caused by sometime else.  Stiffness and pain in a joint could be cause by <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> or other <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the joint.  In some cases, the pinky toe joint gets pushed inward which can result in deformity and pain.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a>.  This is a foot specialist that will be able to examine your toe, determine what is wrong, and provide the necessary treatments.  "
Will an ankle sprain continue to give me pain the rest of my life?,"If you no longer have any pain or swelling in the ankle then that is a good sign that it has probably healed up. Even so, this is a great question to discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.

Once you sprain your ankle, you are predisposed to sprain it again, as the ligaments do tend to stay a bit looser and less strong after each successive sprain. What this means, for starters, is that you must exercise a lot of care when engaging in any vigorous sports, taking care not to sprain your ankle again. 

Also it means that if you do sprain your ankle again you should definitely go see your doctor right away and not stay home without seeking help. Your primary care doctor can examine the ankle and determine the severity of the sprain and help you decide what treatment might be necessary and when you might be able to resume physical activity. 

Again, please mention the sprain to your primary care doctor. They can take a look at the ankle at that time and check for any residual problems. "
Do I really have plantar fasciitis?,"Plantar fasciitis can be very painful and disruptive to daily life.  As you know, the plantar fascia is a thick band of connective tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot and helps support it.  Because this inflammation and irritation is exacerbated by weight-bearing, it is often much less painful during periods of inactivity, ie after resting if or before getting up in the morning and putting weight on the area.  From this standpoint your symptoms do sound like plantar fasciitis.  However, if your are concerned or still have questions about your symptoms, you should definitely bring this up again with your physician or seek a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a>.  There are several other treatment modalities that can help with plantar fasciitis pain, including rest, massage, physical therapy, <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, orthotics in your shoes, changing the type of hoes that you wear, cold therapy or heat therapy (often done by a <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a>), anti-inflammatory medications, and even steroid injections. Some people have plantar fasciitis because of an underlying heel spur, and treating this finding can often help control symptoms. Overall, it sounds like you may have plantar fasciitis, but you should continue to discuss this with your physician or another physician as a second opinion to address your questions."
Is the pain in my toe an ingrown toe nail?,"Unfortunately the symptoms you describe do sound like an ingrown toenail.  An ingrown toenail occurs when one side of the nail starts growing into the fleshy area at the side of your toe instead of growing up and staying in the nail bed.  This can often happen when toenails are clipped too short.  The symptoms of an ingrown toenail include exactly what your describe: the side of the toe where the nail is growing will become swollen, red, and exquisitely painful.  Depending upon how far ingrown the nail becomes, you can also develop a small infection or abscess there.  You should definitely see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away.  He or she can examine the area and help determine whether this is an ingrown toenail or whether it could also be something else. Gout, for example, also presents with a swollen red toe.  If you do have an ingrown toenail, the best treatment is to soak the foot to help with the pain; drain any abscess; and trim the nail.  Your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> may want to refer you to a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatry specialist</a>.  The best way to prevent ingrown toenails in future is to let you nails grow so that the nail edge is above the tip of the toe and then trim the nail straight across without any curve."
Why do I have pain in the arch of my foot?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having this severe pain. You should definitely get in to see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> about this, either a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, because there is likely treatment options available to you. 

I think the most likely cause of your pain, based on the symptoms you describe, is something called plantar fasciitis. This is a condition in which the connective tissue in front of the heel bone becomes inflamed, leading to pain particularly with walking. Your doctor can confirm the diagnosis for you with a physical examination although, based on your history and risk factors, they may also want to perform other tests, such as an x-ray, to rule out other causes of the pain such as a stress fracture or bone spur. 

If the diagnosis does turn out to be plantar fasciitis, your doctor will be able to recommend treatments, including anti inflammatory medications for pain, exercises to help stretch out the tissue in the arch of your foot and back of your calf, and proper footwear to support your arch and help the inflammation settle down more quickly. 

Get in to see your doctor as soon as possible, and good luck. "
How can I get rid of the infection in my toe?,"This sounds like you probably have a paronychia, which is the medical terms for an infection in the soft tissue of the nail fold on the sides of the nail. As you have already anticipated, the most common causes of developing a paronychia include damage or trauma to the nail or nail fold, as well as from ingrown toe nails. 

You should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for help with this problem. They will be able to determine how bad the paronychia is, and what medical treatments might be needed. 

Simple paronychia can sometimes be treated with simple home remedies, such as soaking the foot in warm water to draw out the infection and applying a topical antibiotic ointment. However, more complicated paronychia may actually contain a collection of pus that will need to be drained in order to heal. If the infection is very severe, you may also need to take an oral antibiotic medication in order to clear up the infection. 

Your doctor will be able to help you decide which of these options is right for your case. 

In the meantime, avoid picking at or manipulating the area, and wear loose fitting shoes so that pressure does not make the problem worse. "
Why do I keep getting an ingrown toenail?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having such trouble with this issue. As you know, ingrown toenails occur when the nail begins to press into the tissue on the side of the nail. In addition to being very uncomfortable, this can lead to problems with chronic infections of the nail fold, which are known as paronychia. 

One of the main causes of ingrown toenails is wearing shoes that are too tight. Therefore, one easy step to take might be to make sure that you always wear comfortable, supportive shoes. 

You should also talk with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> to make sure there is no evidence of infection, or paronychia. If so you may need to take antibiotics to help clear up the infection. 

In recurrent cases of ingrown toenails, a podiatrist is an especially useful resources. They can perform special nail splinting procedures and can also cut the nails in special ways to try to reduce recurrence of the problem. They can also take a look at the types of shoes you are wearing and determine whether or not you might needs specially designed orthotics footwear. 

Set up a visit with your doctor at your earliest convenience. "
How do you treat an ingrown toenail?,"Ingrown toenails can be very painful!  As you have pointed out, they usually happen when the toenails are clipped too short (most often on the big toes) and then the nail grows into the soft tissue of the toe itself.  There are several different ways to treat ingrown toenails, some of which can be done at home and others of which require additional intervention.  The best thing to do initially is see your physician to assess whether there is evidence of infection where the nail is growing into the soft part of the toe.  Your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> may also want to refer you to a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> or orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> specializing in the foot/ankle.   

However, to address the toenail problem, it is possible to use cotton underneath the nail to help lift it away from the skin.  This is clearly not enough if you have developed a small pocket of infection, however.  In cases involving a more significantly ingrown nail, it may be necessary to have part of your toenail removed.  You may also need topical antibiotic cream in this case.  Your doctor may also want you to soak your foot regularly.  Once an ingrown toenail is corrected, it is also important to take measures to prevent another one from developing.  This includes trimming your toenails to a moderate length (not too short!); trimming them straight across; and wearing appropriate shoes. Again, please discuss with your foot doctor!"
What does it mean if my toe always pops?,"This popping and cracking sound that you are describing from your toe are unlikely to represent too little calcium, but they may be a sign that there is some chronic problem with the ligaments or tendons that insert on that toe. Over time, all of that popping can lead to inflammation that eventually causes irreversible changes in the muscles or there attachments, and there can be arthritic changes. It should be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who may or may not recommend another visit to a specialist who may choose to either get a radiographic image, place a small splint, or, most likely, continue to observe the area. He or she may recommend some special exercises that you can do to reduce strain on that toe, and may suggest strengthening maneuvers or even special orthotics to protect the area, all of this depending on what is obvious when they visit with you. As with any doctor visit, the key will be in how long this has been going on for, when it started, if there was any extra trauma, and whether things have been getting better or worse. Please discuss these with your doctor, and follow their recommendations for improved foot health. "
How do you remove a corn?,"Corns, as you probably know, are thick areas of skin that develop in spots of pressure on the foot. They most common develop on the outside edges of the foot over bony spots that rub against shoes, but they can also occur between the toes at times. They can be very painful, because the thickened skin presses against the underlying tissue. 

If you think you might have a corn, I would recommend that you go see your foot <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to confirm the diagnosis. If it turns out that you do have a corn, there are several treatment options available to you. 

First, for more simple cases, simply relieving the pressure that produced the corn in the first place may be enough. For example, getting rid of any tight or poorly fitting shoes is an important first step. Additionally, your doctor may recommend an over the counter pressure treatment, such as a pressure relieving device or a corn plaster. 

More serious cases may require shaving of the corn. It is best not to try this yourself, as there is danger of cutting yourself or causing a skin infection. However, a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> is very skill at removing corns surgically and should be able to help you out!"
Why are my heels cracking?,"It is common for many people to have cracking of the bottom of their heels that comes because of the dryness of that part of the foot. Some people are especially prone to this problem, such as those that have other skin conditions or people that wear footware with open heels. For example, those that wear sandals in dry climates will often have this complaint. The best solution for the problem is to increase the moisture of the area, and keep further moisture from leaving the body via the cracks. This can be done with a heavy duty moisturizing cream, which is available over the counter. Wearing closed shoes can also be helpful. They even make pads that can be worn over the heal to help keep the moisture in, which provide relief to some people. The key is to make sure that the area does not become infected with a bacteria or progress to serious breakdown of the skin. People with a poor vascular supply, such as diabetics, should have someone examine their feet regularly to make sure that there are no wounds that are not healing appropriately, as these can progress to become serious infections that at time require amputation. Please speak to your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a>. "
Why do I have white spots in my fingernails?,"White spots on the fingernails are generally related to benign causes, and are not usually a cause of significant concern. Punctate leukonychia has multiple causes depending on your personal situation. If you are a generally healthy individual, white spots on the nails are very common and quite harmless. These are mostly seen in youthful people and more commonly in females. They are most commonly result of simple stress or minor trauma to the fingernails, generally at the base of the nail. 
If there is a dietary deficiency of zinc, this may also show up as white spots on the fingernails. There is no effective treatment to completely prevent these white spots from occurring. These spots generally will disappear as the nail grows. To maintain good nail hygiene, it is important to keep the nails clean and dry, avoid nail biting, avoid using too many chemical containing agents such as nail polish removers containing formaldehyde or acetone. Most importantly, attempt to reduce any minor trauma to the nails as well. 
It is best for you to make an appointment with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to determine what your general health is like, and to determine if there are other medical conditions that maybe responsible for your symptoms though rare. "
What happens if you tear a ligament and don?t get it repaired?,"Toe fractures are relatively common and most do not require surgical fixation.  However, it sounds as though you may still be having some residual complaints after a toe fracture so it is best to see an orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (preferably one specializing in the foot and ankle) for a more thorough exam.  He or she will want to look at the x-rays that initially identified your fracture and will probably then want a second set of images for comparison.  There are a significant number of ligaments in the foot and ankle--the ones that usually cause more of a problem when injured are in the ankle, but your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> will want to examine your toe to make sure that there isn't some other underlying issue that may need further attention.  It is definitely possible to elect not to repair a ligament injury, although the pros and cons of <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> v no surgery would require a more detailed discussion with an orthopedic specialist.

In addition, it is possible that the 'looseness' you are feeling relates to some weakness in the muscles near the injured toe as a result of walking differently because of the initial injury.  An orthopedic specialist can also make recommendations about physical therapy or any other brace or support device that might help protect your injury while it heals while also allowing you to resume your normal physical activity as soon as possible."
What should I do if I strained my achilles tendon?,"The achilles tendon is a common injured area. Often this will resolve on its own. Unfortunately, there are some instances in which this requires more intensive therapy (such as <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>). I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. 

If your primary care doctor confirms that this is just a strain (and not a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> of the bone or tendon rupture) --- they may prescribe what we call ""RICE therapy."" The main problem in a strain is that the tendon becomes inflammed. Therefore, RICE therapy works to reduce the inflammation. The R in RICE stands for rest -- try and stay off the effected food as possible. The I stands for ICE -- at least initially this can help reduce the swelling. The C stand for compression -- by an ace wrap from the local drug store can help. Finally the E stands for elevation -- keep it elevated while sitting in order to allow for the swelling to decrease.

Beyond RICE therapy, there are some medicines that can reduce inflammation. These include motrin (ibuprofen) or advil or naproxen. They all have side effects and can be dangerous, so talk to your doctor about this.

Talk to your doctor. Good luck!"
Is the pain in my heel a heel spur?,"I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. There are many possible issues that could be causing your symptoms. Fortunately, there may be a good treatment. 

There are many causes of heel pain. A heel spur is a possibility -- although often these are not that painful. A heel spur occurs from repetitive use of the foot (which we all do) but with inappropriate stress being placed on the heel bone (calcaneous). Because of the stress the bone grows and the spur then can cause problems with the nerves or muscles. Because the bone is the part of the body that is abnormal in a spur, an <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">X-ray</a> to look at the bones can be helpful is seeing if this is the case.

Quite honestly, a more common and likely possibility is what we call plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia is the soft tissue connection between the foot bones that runs across the bottom of the foot and attaches to the heel. If this piece of tissue becomes inflamed -- this is known as plantar fasciitis. This occurs because of poor arch support. Therefore treatment with shoe inserts and or orthotics can help.

See your doctor. If necessary, he or she can refer you to a <a href=""/podiatrists"">foot doctor</a> (a podiatrist). Good luck!"
How do you prevent hangnails?,"Hang nails although benign, tend to be a nagging and annoying ongoing problem for a lot of people. Hang nails are also a cause of a lot of pain. A hang nail is usually torn skin around the fingernail or toenail. A hang nail is not a part of the nail itself and consists of dry skin made of a fibrous protein known as keratin and may or may not include a small portion of the nail. There are numerous causes for why hang nails can occur. Dry skin is a major cause of hang nails. Other reasons include frequent nail biting, cutting a cuticle too closely or from previous <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the nail. Therefore in order to prevent hang nails, depending on your situation, it is important to address the cause. It is important to keep the nail hydrated to prevent cuticles and nails from becoming dry and brittle during the summer months. It is also important to avoid biting the nails. In addition, it is useful to avoid cutting the cuticles with a cuticle tool to push back the cuticle. Furthermore, if your work involves heavy labor or work with chemical products, wear gloves to prevent dry nails. Please make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to determine why this is happening to you, and what exactly needs to be done to treat the underlying issue properly. "
Why do the soles of my feet hurt?,"Pain in the feet is a very common. There are many causes and fortunately, many cures. I would recommend that you have this evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she, if it is deemed appropriate, may refer you to a foot specialist (known as a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a>).

The foot is actually a very complex structure. The small area of the feet must support the entire body's weight as well as provide the movability required for us to move. Because of this, it is very easily injured. The tendons, muscles, bones and ligaments can all cause a problem.

Probably the most common cause of the bottom of the <a href=""/procedure/foot-pain-187"">foot pain</a> is a process known as plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia is the tendon that connects the bones of the bottom of the foot. This plantar fascia can easily be inflamed by repetitive stress -- caused by walking and the weight of your body. This normally occurs because an abnormal arch of your foot.

Other common problems include bone fractures, nerve problems and muscle problems.

Talk to your doctor. There are many treatments for this. You may need better arch support which can be provided by an orthotic (shoe insert). I would strongly recommend a podiatrist. Good luck!"
Is there any way to make a callous go away?,"Calluses as you probably now are a normal reaction of the skin to pressure and friction. In response to these physical stresses, the skin becomes thicker and tougher, resulting in a callus.

Because of this, the simplest and most important step in preventing and treating calluses is to remove the source of the physical irritation. Practically, this means that if you are developing calluses it is likely that your boots don't fit and you should think about getting a pair that does! Otherwise, although you can remove the calluses, they will just come right back again. 

To remove the calluses directly, do not cut at them with a knife or other sharp tool! This just runs the risk of cutting too deeply and causing pain, <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>, and infection. Rather soak your feet in the bathtub until they become soft and wrinkly. Then, take a pumice stone and rub it gently but repeatedly over the callus. The callus will have become softened in the bathwater and it will start to rub off onto the pumice. If you repeat this every time you take a bath, the callus will soon be gone!

Please do talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for more information."
Is there an effective way to remove and prevent corns?,"Sorry to hear that this has been such a persistent problem for you. As you probably known, corns are simply areas of thickened, tough skin that forms over areas of chronic pressure on the feet. The most common location for corns is on the ball of the foot or edge of the big toe, but they can occur elsewhere, including between the toes. 

Since corns occur primarily due to too much pressure over certain areas of the foot, the main treatment for preventing them is to make sure that you always wear sensible, good-fitting shoes. Unfortunately, for many people this is a deal breaker, since 'sensible and good fitting' does not always mean very fashionable. But, nevertheless, this is the only guaranteed way to keep the corns from coming back again and again. 

In terms of treatment of pre-existing corns, there are numerous over the counter treatment products that can be used to soften the hardened skin, permitting you to file down the corn. Cutting and trimming should always be done very carefully to prevent <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>. Application of moleskin or another pressure relieving patch over the corn can be helpful. 

But a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> is a the best place to start to make sure you are taking the right approach. Good luck!"
What does nail fungus look like?,"This certainly could be foot fungus. Fungus can infect the skin of the feet (around the nails, between the toes, etc) or it can infect the nails themselves. In the former case, this is called athlete's foot, and it is characterized by itching, cracking, and redness of the involved skin. There is often an odor that can be quite unpleasant. In the case of the latter, nail infections are characterized by gradual thickening and ""bumpiness"" of the nails, which also tend to turn opaque and yellow in color. 

Athlete's foot is relatively easy to clear up. Paying good attention to skin hygiene (clean shoes, clean socks) is important. Applying a standard over the counter anti fungal cream is also important, and you should be able to find one at any pharmacy or supermarket. 

Nail infections, on the other hand, are much more difficult to get rid of. They typically do not respond to anti fungal creams, because the fungus lives so deep inside the nail that the cream cannot penetrate. Most cases of nail fungus will require seeing your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a>, who can prescribe a strong oral anti fungal medication which will improve your chances of clearing up the problem. Again, start by talking with your doctor!"
Is there anything I can do to help my sprained ankle heal other than rest?,"If you are experiencing significant pain or swelling of the ankle and you have not seen your <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctor</a> yet, I recommend that you do so. Sometimes, what is thought to be a sprain is actually a small break in a bone n the ankle, and it is important to evaluate for that with a physical examination and, sometimes, x-rays as well. Also, it is important to evaluate for any signs of ligament tear or severe injure, which might be indications to see an orthopedic doctor. 

Assuming this is just a simple sprain, then the mainstay of treatment is anti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen, ice, and rest. In particular, it is very important to not go back to any sports activity until the ankle is totally healed, as injuring an ankle that is already sprained and not completely healed can predispose to chronic ankle pain and instability. 

Based on what your doctor finds, they may also recommend an ankle brace to help stabilize the ankle and relieve discomfort. They may also recommend <a href=""/procedure/wheelchair-crutches-1243"">crutches</a> to help you recover more quickly. If they find any evidence of a serious <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, they will make a referral to an orthopedic doctor or a sports medicine clinic for more follow up. "
How do you repair an ingrown toenail?,"An ingrown toenail is a very common form of a nail disease. It can often be very painful where the nail grows such that it cuts into the nail bed on one or both sides. An ingrown toenail most commonly occurs from an infection of the nail bed and an inflammatory reaction causing the nail to be buried under this. Sometimes, the nail can actually grow into the tissue surrounding the nail. 

Symptoms of an ingrown toenail include pain that is worsened with touch against objects such as socks, shoes and can be exacerbated by running where the trauma can cause the nail to further further into the nail bed. It is very easy for ingrown toenails to thus get infected. This warrants that good nail care is essential and very important. If an ingrown toenail is infected, symptoms may include redness and swelling, pus or bloody drainage from the nail. 

Treatment of ingrown toenails ranges from soaking the toe in antibacterial solution with warm water, but to avoid touching the nail to avoid infection. However, a bad ingrown toenail, as you put it, certainly requires that you make an appointment with a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> to diagnose it correctly and treat it effectively (i,e. antibiotics, removal of the ingrown nail or even <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>). In the interim, it is important to keep the area clean, keep shoes dry, change socks daily and avoid prying the nail."
Is there any way to prevent plantar warts?,"Plantar <a href=""/procedure/wart-s-191"">warts</a> are fairly common misery that are caused by coming into direct contact with the human papilloma virus (HPV), such as swimming in public pools or walking barefoot in a locker room.   Warts on your feet and toes are caused by an infection of the outer skin layer (epidermis) by HPV.  Once the wart starts growing, it embeds itself in this tissue and therefore can be very difficult to get rid of.  They are slightly contagious from person to person or from one area to another on the same person.  There is no single perfect treatment for plantar warts.  However, a good treatment may include salicyclic acid that is used to burn the warts.  Since the skin on and surround the wart is thick, most over-the-counter medications do not always work effective as they do not penetrate the skin well.  Warts that are left untreated may take up to several years to clear up.  Some plantar warts are stubborn and do not take well to treatment.  If this is your case, a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> will remove them for you.  The treatment of your warts depends on their location and size, your skin type, and medical judgment.  I suggest that you seek medical attention and advice from a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or podiatrist for an appropriate treatment.  "
How can I get rid of toenail fungus?,"Fungal nail infection is the most common nail complaint heard by foot <a href=""/podiatrists"">doctors</a> so there is no need to feel embarrassed.  Fungal toenail infections are common as fungus thrives on warm, damp and dark environments like your sock that covers your hot, sweaty foot which is ideal for such fungal growth.  Therefore, to ""treat"" it you should try wearing open toe shoes as much as possible in the summer.  When you wear socks, make sure they are made of cotton.  There are three different types of toenail fungus:  black toenail fungus, yellow toenail fungus, and white toenail fungus.  White toenail fungus is more effective when treating with home remedies.  (It is especially effective if you are in the early stage of infection).  Other types are very difficult to treat at home and they are very contagious that it is not uncommon to have all ten of your toes infected with fungus.  Fortunately, nail fungus can be treated and completely get rid of even the most severe cases by your doctor.  You should have your doctor run a test to determine if your nail fungus can be treated with home remedies.  A different course of action is required for each type of nail fungus.  A fungal toenail infection may also be a symptom of a systematic condition known as athlete's foot that requires medical care.  I would recommend a visit with a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> soon."
Why are the bottoms of my feet cracking?,"Cracked heels are a common foot problem that is generally caused by extremely dry skin (xerosis).  This condition, which often refers as foot fissures, especially affects the heels because their thickened dry skin is more likely to crack often due to mechanical factors that increase pressures in that area (i.e, prolonged standing or the way you walk, especially if you are obese).  Also, wearing open backed shoes, as most of us do so on those hot summer days, unfortunately allows the fat on the heel to expand sideways and increases the pressure to crack.  Not drinking enough water and poor nutrition are also risk factors for cracked heels.  You are right to state that this condition can be the result of a fungal infection (i.e., athlete's foot) in the skin on the feet.  If left untreated, these cracked heels may develop into deep heel fissures that can allow bacteria to enter the body, leading to infection and <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>.  A cracked heel may also be a sign and symptom of a more serious medical condition, such as diabetes or a thyroid disease.  A break in the skin must always be treated to avoid potential serious infections so I suggest that you seek prompt medical care from a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> as well as to rule out any serious medical condition.   Good luck."
Is the pain in my foot some sort of condition?,"Foot pain is a very common condition. The foot is such an extensively used area of the body with so many moving parts and that is under so much stress that it is common for it to ""act up."" Fortunately, there are many treatments for foot pain. I would recommend you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. If needed you may see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">foot doctor</a> or podiatrist.

What you describe could be consistent with plantar fasciitis -- one of the most common causes of foot pain. This condition occurs when the plantar fascia -- the connective tissue that lines the bottom of the foot becomes inflamed. This often occurs because the arch of the foot is often off. There are many treatments for this -- often including ""arch support."" This includes orthotics or special shoes versus shoe inserts. A podiatrist can help further treat this.

Other causes of foot pain include bone pain or fracture. These mostly occur after trauma. Rarely, repeated use can cause a ""stress fracture"" -- but this is not as common.

The joints of the foot can also be inflamed and cause pain. For example, <a href=""/procedure/gout-1025"">gout</a> -- a crystal deposition in the joint -- often occurs in the first big toe's joint.

See your doctor for more information. There are many other causes than those mentioned above, all of which have some treatments. Good luck! "
Why do I keep getting bunions?,"Bunions, as you know, are painful outcroppings of bone that develops on the outer edge of the big toe. If they are large they cause the big toe to push inward, and they can cause significant problems of pain and redness of the overlying the skin because of rubbing against the shoes. 

Most of the time, bunions are caused by wearing tight shoes. If this is the problem in your case, wearing properly fitting shoes should help correct the problem and prevent it from recurring. Taping or splinting the big toe, which is something your <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a> can do for you might help in the meantime. 

Other causes of bunions include a genetic tendency to them (mostly based on your inherited foot anatomy) or weakness of the foot muscles, which can occur with some inherited nerve problems in the feet. I suspect that if you have already switched to comfortable, roomy shoes, then you fall into one of these two categories, and you will be at high risk of having the bunions recur multiple times, even with bunionectomy. In this case, I would recommend talking to your podiatrist to see if there are any additional interventions that you could potentially try. "
What is this bump on my toe?,"This does indeed sound like a corn. Essentially a corn is a thickened area of skin on the foot in response to chronic pressure or irritation of the skin. When the skin is irritated, its natural response is to thicken as a protective measure. Corns usually occur on the outsides of the toes where they rub against the shoes, but they can also occur between the toes. 

The first line of treatment for corns is reducing the pressure on the feet. This absolutely requires wearing only comfortable shoes that put no pressure on the feet at all. Additionally, you can buy small donuts and gels that can be applied around the corn to further alleviate pressure. Soaking the corn in the bath and then gently rubbing it with a pumice stone will gradually reduce the thickness and take the pressure off as well. 

If these measures don't work, then you should see a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a>. They can either cut the corn off altogether, or if there is another underlying cause of the corn (such as a hammertoe) they can suggest treatments for that as well. They can also help determine what kind of shoes would be least likely to aggravate the situation. "
Can kidney stones affect bowel movements?,"It sounds like you are experiencing a number of very unpleasant symptoms!  Kidney stones can definitely cause significant <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> and discomfort as well as blood in the urine.  Pain or pain medications can also contribute to irregular bowel movements and constipation.  However, some of the other symptoms you describe could also reflect other medical problems.  Given these symptoms and the changes in your health, the best thing for you to do is see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> as soon as possible for a more thorough evaluation and physical exam.

Your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> will want to know when your symptoms started and will likely ask you some additional questions to help determine whether there is one underlying problem (like a kidney stone) that is causing all of your symptoms or whether there may be more than one thing going on.  In addition to a physical exam, some simple laboratory tests such as basic blood work and an analysis of a urine specimen can help identify whether you have signs of symptoms of an infection in the urinary system or evidence of a problem within the kidneys themselves.  Finally, your personal medical history and family history may also be quite relevant.

Hopefully you will be feeling better soon, but new symptoms like this should always be taken seriously and evaluated by your physician right away. Book an appointment today!"
I am suffering from kidney infection; will I ever be normal?,"I am so sorry to hear that you have been having difficulty with your kidneys. It is promising that your <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> was unremarkable and that you did respond well to the steroids, but it is certainly disappointing that you had such a severe response to salt. At this point, the key thing will be to establish a clear diagnosis. That may mean that you need to seek a second opinion from a tertiary medical center. This is likely to be affiliated with a university hospital or the equivalent. If you have already done this, there are several medical centers across the country that specialize in seeing those patients who have been treated unsuccessfully at other sites, and you could consider visiting with a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> at one of these locations. A few of these will have chat lines where you can submit a specific question with some of your data prior to making an appointment, so that all of the necessary information is provided and your appointment can be as useful as possible. As far as your prognosis, it is difficult to say what to expect based on the information that you have provided. Please speak further with your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> to establish what your diagnosis is and what you can expect moving forward, and best of luck. "
What is Goodpasture's syndrome?,"I'm sorry to hear that your brother is dealing with this diagnosis. Goodpasture's syndrome is essentially one of the autoimmune disease, in which the body produces antibodies that react against components of the body itself, leading to symptoms. In the case of Goodpasture's syndrome, these antibodies react with a component of collagen that forms part of the structure of the kidneys, and also of the lungs. Therefore, the symptoms of Goodpasture's typically occur in the kidneys and also in the lungs. Lung involvement is not found in all patients. 

The symptoms of Goodpasture's syndrome generally involve the sudden and rapid development of kidney damage or kidney failure. There is often blood in the urine as one of the first signs. In those who have lung involvement, there may also be <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> into the lungs, which can be very serious if it occurs in large quantities. 

Treatment for Goodpasture's syndrome involves, acutely, filtering of the blood to try to remove some of the antibodies that are causing the problem. Subsequently medications to try to suppress the immune reaction are needed to bring the condition under control. This therapy is usually all coordinated by a kidney <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a>, or <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>, who should be able to answer any additional questions your brother might have. "
I am a 75 yr old female and my blood pressure is 167/65. Is this normal? ,"You are definitely taking a lot of medications to control your blood pressure! The blood pressure reading that you gave me has a normal diastolic number (the bottom number), but the systolic number (the top number) is still high. In most cases, this number should be under 140. 

Therefore, I would say that your blood pressure is still not totally under control. This is an issue that you should revisit with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It might also be necessary to see a specialist, such as a <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a>, or to ask your primary care doctor to investigate for underlying causes of your <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a> other than ""normal"" high blood pressure in the setting of aging. For example, sometimes alterations in hormone levels in the blood, such as thyroid hormone or cortisol, can lead to high blood pressure that is persistently high even after taking multiple blood pressure medications simultaneously. Similarly, sometimes a narrowing in the arteries leading to the kidneys (renal artery stenosis) can cause this picture. 

Your doctor may want to perform a more detailed workup for these so-called ""secondary causes of hypertension"" because if one is identified it may be treatable. Make an appointment with your doctor today. Good luck!"
Why are my kidneys hurting?,"Do you have a <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a> right now? You should definitely be seeing them on a very regular basis, because it sounds like you have been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, which is a chronic condition that is inherited and passed down in families. 

It is important to follow closely with your kidney doctor, because often polycystic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure, which can require treatment. It is great that you are not smoking, drinking, etc - as keeping healthy is important to maintain your kidneys as strong as possible. 

Unfortunately, people who have polycystic kidney disease often do have chronic pain related to the growth of the kidneys and the cysts. This is something that your doctor needs to be addressing, so I would make sure the next time you see them that you let them know that the pain is getting to be unmanageable and that you need some help figuring out what to do with the pain. 

At that time, you can also ask your doctor what your kidney function is like and if there is anything else you need to be doing right now to take care of yourself. 

Good luck, and I hope you are feeling better soon!"
I passed a Kidney stone - how should I store it?,"This is great news! First, because I am sure that you feel a lot better and in a lot less pain now that you have passed your kidney stone! Second, it is really helpful to have the stone on hand, because your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> can send it off for testing to see what kind of stone it is. 

Knowing the chemical composition of the kidney stone is helpful, because it can help determine if there was any preventable cause for the stone forming in the first place. For example, with certain types of stones, making some changes to your diet can prevent more stones from forming in the future, and knowing the type of stone can help you tailor your diet. 

For the time being, you should store the stone in a dry, cool, dark place. This will prevent it from dissolving or decaying away. A zip lock bag should do just fine! You should definitely not store it in water or any other liquid, as this could lead to dissolving or chemical changes. 

I would schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> right away, or whichever other doctor was managing your <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a>, and let them know that you have collected this specimen. They will be able to tell you what to do with it next!"
Is taking calcium supplements dangerous with a history of kidney stones?,"It sounds like you had a pretty good work up for your kidney stones already, if you had blood and urine tests done after your first attack with kidney stones. Typically, what these studies are looking for is any evidence of why you tend to form kidney stones, such as an increase in calcium concentration in the urine. Especially in younger people, however, it is quite common for these tests not to demonstrate any obvious abnormality. In most of these people, like yourself, the major factor contributing to stone formation is probably not drinking enough water. 

Most of the time, therefore, making sure you keep your fluid intake up for the rest of your life is enough to prevent stones from forming again. The impact of your calcium supplements is less straight forward. Most likely your calcium supplements do put you at somewhat increased risk of another episode of kidney stones, but in most cases that risk can probably be managed by keeping up your fluid intake. One approach that some doctors might use is to measure the amount of calcium in your urine while taking the supplements to see if it has gone up significantly. 

I would suggest talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care </a><a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a> about this issue in more detail. Good luck. "
How do you pass a kidney stone?,"Yes, and I am sorry. Passing <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a> can often be a very painful experience, from what many of my patients have described. That being said, there are some people who will not even know that they have passed them, and we can both hope that you are one of those people! Kidney stones are caused by multiple factors, but usually have some contribution from low urinary flow (such as dehydration). With this lower flow and other medical factors which alter the type of stone formed, the urine precipitates and the extra minerals in the urine can create a stone. Unfortunately, once they have formed, nature only gave them one direction to go: out with the rest of the urine. Given that the pathway is narrow and lined with muscle that contracts intermittently, it is likely that at some point the stone will become lodged along the way and the body will try to expel it with muscle contractions. This will cause severe but intermittent pain (called ""colicky"" pain). Drinking as much as you can will help the stones to pass, and avoiding specific things in your diet (which your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> will suggest based on your case) may help to avoid forming new ones. Please speak to your doctor. "
What should I do about my kidney stone?,"If you have not seen your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> about this yet, then you definitely should do so right away. If the pain is very severe, or if you have fever or nausea or vomiting, or if you cannot keep down an adequate amount of liquids, then you should go to the emergency room for immediate evaluation. Otherwise, go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as you possibly can. 

It is normal to have a small amount of blood in the urine when you pass a kidney stone. This is because the stone causes some minor damage to the urine tubes as it comes out, and this leads to bleeding, which should get better soon. However, I am concerned by the fact that you are still having pain, as the pain should go away once the stone is passed. This suggest to me that maybe you still have a stone that needs to be passed, or that you have another complication, such as a urine infection. I am also concerned by the <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, which might indicate that you are getting dehydrated. 

All of these observations point towards needing to be seen right away by your doctor (or in an emergency room) so that you can be evaluated and treated. "
How long can someone live while they are getting dialysis treatments?,"I am sorry to hear that your grandmother is requiring <a href=""/procedure/dialysis-388"">dialysis</a>. As you know, dialysis is used when the kidney stop working. Since the kidneys work to clean the blood of toxic chemicals, if they are not working these toxins accumulate and need to be removed using dialysis. 

Dialysis prolongs the life of those who have kidney failure. However, it is important to realize that the life expectancy of people who are on dialysis is much less than people who are not on dialysis. In part, this is because dialysis is only done in people who are very sick. At the same time, however, dialysis has a whole series of its own risks and complications, including infections, and the risks of these increase with the length of time on dialysis.

For most people, dialysis is a <a href=""/procedure/bridge-17"">bridge</a> to kidney transplant. While waiting for a kidney transplant, people are kept alive with dialysis. However, for some elderly or very sick people, kidney transplant may not be an option, and dialysis might be the only remaining alternative. 

If your grandmother has questions about what dialysis means for her, then she should sit down with the <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a> who is managing her dialysis treatments, who will be happy to answer her questions. "
How can people live with just one kidney?,"This is such an interesting question, because it demonstrates how flexible and adaptable our bodies are! It turns out that, with respect the the kidneys, the body actually has a considerable reserve of necessary function, and one kidney has way more capacity than is needed to perform all vital functions. In short, having two kidneys is redundant and provides the body with extra security and back up in cause something goes wrong. When one kidney stops working or is removed surgically, what happens is that the other kidney begins to enlarge and its capacity to filter blood goes up dramatically. 

Therefore, your father should be just fine with only one kidney. Obviously, there are some precautions that need to be taken. For example, people with only one kidney should engage in dangerous contact sports because damage to the one remaining kidney could be a major problem. Similarly, people with only one kidney should be careful to avoid any medications that could potentially damage the kidney for the same reason. Potentially kidney-damaging medicines include common medications like ibuprofen, so your father will want to talk about this carefully with his <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a> or his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to make sure he takes the necessary precautions. "
Can an AV fistula access cause your arm to fall asleep?,"I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with <a href=""/procedure/dialysis-388"">dialysis</a>, and I hope that you receive a transplant soon!

AV fistulas as you know are formed by connecting together a vein and an artery in the forearm. This is the stablest form of access that can be used for performing dialysis, and a good AV fistula can last for many years. 

Unfortunately, there are some side effects that can occur from having a AV fistula. Many of these side effect are related to the fact that a lot of the blood that usually flowed down the arm into the hand and back again gets instead diverted quickly into the vein side of the graft. The result is that blood flow to the hand is reduced, and this can cause several symptoms, including <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> in the hand, pain, or a sensation of coolness. 

If the numbness that you are experience is not too bad, then I think you can tolerate it and chalk it up to the fistula. However, sometimes these symptoms can be very severe and can require revising the fistula; if you are concerned about the degree of numbness, or if you have any pain or if your hand turns blue, then you should definitely talk to your <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a>. "
"""If I have kidney stones, will I eventually have to pass them?""","The answer to this question depends on how large the stones are, and how many of them you have.  If you have stones in your kidney, there is always a possibility that you could pass them down your ureters into your bladder.  This is when <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a> become very painful.  Since you haven't passed any yet, there is a possibility that they will dissolve over time.  In the mean time, you should take measures to try and prevent more of them from forming.  In patients that have no other major health problems, I recommend people increase their fluid intake which dilutes their urine and prevents stones from forming.  Depending on the type of stone that formed, there are medications that can prevent them from forming.  These are all issues that you could discuss with your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a>.  

Since you already have documented kidney stones, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a>.  This doctor can take a look at the studies you have had done so far, and make a recommendation on how to get rid of them without any invasive procedures.  If they don't go away, or if you end up passing a stone, then there are procedures they can do to break them apart in your kidney before you pass them.  "
How will a kidney with a cyst and slight enlargement affect my health?,"It sounds like you are quite a complicated patient.  Looking through your past medical history and current symptoms, your case deserves careful attention from your doctors in order to accurately answer these questions.  I do think that I can help you sort some of these things out.

First it is not clear to me whether your renal cyst, the redundant ureter, the aneurysm, aortic valve, blood clotting disorder, and PCOS are related.  What I can say is that simple renal cysts are commonly observed in normal kidneys.  Most of the time they are benign, do not have symptoms that are noticeable by the person that has them, and they rarely require treatment of any kind.  This is not true for polycystic kidney's which can cause kidney failure (perhaps this is what your dad has?).  Thus, the abdominal pain and distension and frequent urination are not likely to be caused by the kidney cyst.  

I suggest that specifically for the renal cyst that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  This is a medical <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> that has specialized in the kidneys.  A <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> specializes in the bladder, urethra, and ureters which carry urine outside of the body.  You may end up needing to see both types of doctors in the future.  A urologist will be able to help you with your frequent urination.   "
What to expect after end stage renal failure?,"The answer to your question depends on several factors.  First, some people have end stage <a href=""/procedure/renal-failure-1001"">renal failure</a> that is reversible to a certain extent.  Some people that start on dialysis only need to be on it for a short time.  while their kidneys recover.  Some people's kidneys never recover, meaning that they need dialysis 3 times per week (or more) indefinitely.  While this is quite a hassle, it is necessary to keep someone with end stage renal disease alive.  It is usually the goal of the person with end stage renal disease to eventually get a kidney transplant.  If your brother is otherwise healthy, then he may be a candidate for this.  The key is to begin the transplant evaluation process as soon as possible.  He must never miss a doctor's appointment and always take his medicines exactly on time.  Noncompliance with the health care system usually is a barrier for someone trying to get a transplant.

I suggest that your brother schedule an appointment with his <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  He or she will be able to explain what he is to expect going forward in terms of dialysis, and the possibility of recovering some renal function.  Finally, the two of them can begin speaking about the transplant process.  "
Can I bring food into the room during a sick child visit?,"This is a tricky question in that the answer depends on details of your son's condition that I don't have, as well as the policies and orders in place at his hospital.  In general, people in <a href=""/procedure/renal-failure-1001"">renal failure</a> do require a special diet.  Guidelines for renal failure diets are generally low in fluids, low in protein, low in sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and some other electrolytes, but are still as replete with calories as possible to avoid weight loss and malnutrition.  

Fortunately, some of the worst things about doughnuts may actually work to your advantage in this specific situation.  Doughnuts are not a nutritionally sound food, which is usually a bad thing, and they are most properly reserved as a special treat.  They are high in fat and sugar, and low in protein and nutrients.  In this situation, the fact that they are low in protein and nutrients, but high in calories, may make them an acceptable one-time treat for your son in his current condition (although the very high sugar content may be undesirable).  

However, you always need to clear any special food that you would like to bring him with his medical team.  The best place to start is his nurse.  He or she will know what type of diet is ordered and will be able to talk to the <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> and find out if a special treat like a doughnut would be ok.  This may be the case, but it needs to be a decision made by your son's healthcare team, since they know all the details of his condition.  

Nonetheless, from my experience working in a children's hospital, I know that, if at all possible, your son's medical team will make every effort to accommodate a special treat that would cheer him up, as this is an important part of providing well rounded care to a sick child."
What happens to a person after renal failure occurs?,"<a href=""/procedure/renal-failure-1001"">Renal failure</a> is a term used to describe a state where someone's kidney's are not working at 100% capacity.  Sometimes renal failure is a temporary thing.  If you dad suffered some sort of assault on his renal system that is temporary, sometimes people can regain kidney function.  People that have reduced kidney function usually can survive with only a fraction of full working kidneys for may years.  When someone's renal system gets bad enough that it cannot perform the necessary function for the body, then we call that end stage renal failure.  When end stage renal failure occurs patients must be placed on dialysis.  

Dialysis is a procedure that patients with inadequate renal function must undergo 3 times per week to rid their body of waste products that the kidneys would normally get rid of.  Dialysis is a tough procedure to go through so often, so good candidates are people that do not have any other major life threatening health problems.  Finally, if your dad if fairly young, he may be eligible for a kidney transplant.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment for your dad with a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  This <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> will be able to tell you and your dad what stage of renal failure he is in, and if anything can be done to reverse it.  If your dad must go on dialysis, then this doctor can facilitate that.  If your dad is eligible for a transplant, then this doctor can help with that too.  "
What will a nephrological consultation tell me about renal failure?,"Nephrologists are physicians who specialize in the kidneys and the various diseases and disorders that can affect kidney function.  It sounds as though there is some concern that your father may be suffering from kidney failure, hence the referral to the <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  

This appointment will be the best way for both of you to obtain more information about your father's renal health and what might be going on with his kidneys.  There are many different diseases that can affect the kidneys, and <a href=""/procedure/renal-failure-1001"">renal failure</a> affects a large number of people.  It is important for you to know that the term 'renal failure' does encompass a wide range of conditions and that contrary to what the term implies in English, this does not necessarily mean that your father's kidneys are due to stop working any minute.  The health changes caused by renal failure and what can be done to treat it often depend very much on the cause.  For this reason, the nephrology consultation is the best place to start when it comes to getting more information.  Many physicians' offices will have patient handouts to help explain different conditions in more detail.  

In addition, once you have discussed exactly what kind of renal disease your father has, it will be much easier for you both to use reputable sites on the internet to learn more.  Overall, you should simply be prepared to answer questions (and ask them!) at the consultation appointment."
Will they tell me if my body is accepting the new kidney at my kidney transplant follow up?,"Congratulations on getting a kidney transplantation.  Kidney transplants generally have a 90-95% success rate in the first year after transplantation.  You will need to schedule follow-up appointments with your transplant <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, and with your <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  Your nephrologist will routinely check blood tests, and potentially urine tests, to evaluate for the function of your new kidney.

Keeping in mind the high one year success rate, the recipient's body can reject the transplanted kidney in about 5% of patients.  Graft rejection can be divided into several subtypes:

1. 24 hours after transplant: Antibodies that are already in the recipient's bloodstream attack the transplanted kidney in the first 24 hours (""hyperacute rejection"").  The surgeon can usually see this happen while in the operating room; they new kidney may change color and stop producing urine. It is diagnosed more definitively by biopsying the kidney.

2. 1 week to 3 months after transplant: the kidney can be rejected due to new antibodies against the kidney, or can stop working as well due to infection or recurrence of the initial disease. This is diagnosed by a blood test (creatinine) that looks at the kidney function.  If the creatinine value is rising, that raises suspicion for rejection.  

3. More than 3 months after transplant: if your immunosuppressive medication levels are too low, this can lead to kidney rejection. If the levels are too high, you can develop kidney damage from toxic levels of the medications.

You should discuss your concerns with your nephrologist."
If my son is donating his kidney to me should he be at the kidney transplant consultation?,"The answer to your question depends somewhat on the preferences of you and your son's <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> and <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> (kidney <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a>).  Your son will need to have his own nephrology and surgical consultations before that transplantation can be scheduled.  I think that since he is agreeing to give up an organ, that both of you should be present for all the consultations.  This is just a personal opinion, not a medical opinion.  The reason I have this opinion is that this is a huge decision your son is making and both of you need to have all the information possible so that all the risks and benefits of the decision are known.  

I suggest that you discuss this issue at your next appointment with your nephrologist.  It may be a good idea for you and your son to have the same doctor.  This way there is only one cook in the kitchen.  Your doctor will be able to give you his or her opinion on how the appointments and evaluations should be carried out.  Having your son there will be helpful.  At that appointment or a separate appointment your son will need blood work and imaging done of his kidneys to insure that a living donation is possible.  Good luck.  "
How many organ transplants are successful?,"There are few greater altruistic deeds you can do for someone than donating an organ.  I think you will like this answer, as it will be mostly good news.  The vast majority of kidney transplants are successful.  The recipient of the kidney will normally begin making urine right away and can go off dialysis.  A series of immune system suppressant medications are required to be taken without exception for life after a transplant to prevent rejection.  After a living donor (you) gives up one of your kidneys, the other kidney will take over and be able to handle all of the bodies needs that both kidneys previously performed.  The only increased risk you have is operative complications, losing your only kidney from an injury, infection, or cancer will not leave you with a spare.  

Before considering undergoing this procedure, you must be fully evaluated by a qualified <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> (kidney <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a>) who will be able to tell for sure if your body will be minimally effected by having one kidney.  You will also have to be tested to see if you and your mother are an appropriate match for organ donation.  After a series of extensive blood tests, and imaging tests of your kidneys, you and your mother will need to then have a consultation with a transplant <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who will plan and carry out the operation.  "
How difficult is it to get a kidney transplant?,"Organ transplants are regulated by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).  There are generally two steps for getting a kidney transplant:
1) Getting listed for a kidney transplant
2) Finding a donor kidney

As far as getting listed, the patient's underlying medical condition comes into play.  First of all, a patient's kidney disease must be severe enough to warrant going through the risks of a transplant.  Beyond that, the patient's other mecical problems come into play: older patients with multiple other medical problems are less likely to be listed.  Younger patients with fewer medical problems are better candidates.  The use of drugs can often disqualify a patient.  There is a thorough evaluation done by kidney transplant centers to ensure that a patient is well enough to survive the <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> and the immunosuppression required to keep the donor kidney working once it has been transplanted.  This includes numerous blood tests, some imaging studies, and social work and occasionally psychological evaluations.  

Once listed for a transplant, your son's spot on the list depends on how long he has been listed, how severe his kidney disease is (how soon he will require <a href=""/procedure/dialysis-388"">dialysis</a>), and whether a donor kidney matches not only his blood type, but his MHC molecules (a set of six unique, personalized markers on a patient's cells that have to match the donor patient's cells in order for the kidney not to be rejected).

You should take your son to see a pediatric <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> to determine if/when he needs a transplant.  If so, they will begin the evaluation required to get him listed for transplant."
Can dialysis result in a lack of appetite?,"You should definitely talk about this to your <a href=""/procedure/dialysis-388"">dialysis</a> or <a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a>. 

There are many reasons that you could have a drop in your appetite. Dialysis alone can be a serious stress on the system, and the several times a week routine can be a source of fatigue for many patients. On top of this, the changes in your appetite could be a sign of changes in the various chemicals in your blood, such as potassium, calcium, or phosphate. Similarly, if you notice that the symptoms occur mostly right before dialysis time then this might be a sign that your dialysis regimen is not strong enough and may need to be tweaked. 

You should talk to your kidney doctor about this. They will be able to take a look at your current dialysis regimen as well as all of your recent lab results to determine if there is an obvious cause of the symptoms. If they think not, then you may also want to talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It is always possible that you have an unrelated medical condition, such as a problem with your thyroid gland, that your kidney doctor would not necessarily be looking for on a regular basis. "
How long can a person survive on dialysis?,"<a href=""/procedure/dialysis-388"">Dialysis</a> is a difficult medical treatment to endure on such a regular basis. While it is a life preserving necessity, the frequency of therapy is an inconvenience, and the way that it makes you feel is also very difficult to tolerate. While it is impossible to predict how long you will survive given the complexity inherent in every patient, there are things that can either improve or decrease your odds of survival. Younger people obviously survive longer, and have better outcomes in almost all medical conditions associated with dialysis. Those with other medical conditions in addition to dialysis are at an increased risk of an earlier demise. 

And those who refuse their dialysis are obviously at the most risk. In fact, termination of dialysis accounts for an unfortunately high cause of death for many patient treated with dialysis. For the remainder of patients, it is difficult to determine if the dialysis is the cause of death, or if the other illnesses that dialysis patients often have is the predominating factor. With excellent care and persistence in following through with your dialysis treatments, however, many people will survive for long periods of time on dialysis. Speak to your <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> for specifics in your situation. "
What diets can help make congenital kidney disease more bearable?,"Kidney disease is a problem that afflicts millions of individuals, and it interferes with many aspects of everyday life, not just your medical life. The foods that you eat are one of the big ways that it interferes with the life of your family, as you are to avoid foods that are encouraged for many other people. As you sound like you are dedicated to helping preserve your kidney function to the greatest degree, you should speak to your <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> about which diets will be best for you. 

While I am not aware of foods that will help your kidney disease per se, there are restrictions that have been noted to have a moderate effect on preserving renal function. One of these is mild protein restriction. As this can be unhealthy for some people, it would be necessary to speak with your nephrologist about whether or not this would be of any benefit for you, as it is not a good solution for many people. The key to managing your renal function and minimizing the impact your disease has on your life will be in maintaining excellent communication with your physicians and agreeing on a course of therapy that is sustainable. "
How can I live a normal life with congenital kidney disease?,"Congenital kidney disease is a difficult problem to cope with, especially during the college years, when so much of life is focused on activities that are hard on your body--including things such as diet and consumption of certain liquids. The good news is that there are others who are coping with the same difficulties and that you can make the healthy choices that you need without missing out on the college experience. 

While you will need to make difficult decisions at times, you do not have to make them alone. The American Association of Kidney Patients has a list of community support groups on its website, and offers numerous other resources that can be used to find the help that you need. Most colleges will also offer resources and groups that can help those with chronic medical conditions. Finally, your <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> and <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> are able to serve as your advocates in making sure that you able to not only survive the challenge of college with a chronic disease, but also be able to minimize the impact your disease has on your ability to enjoy the experience. Please speak with your physicians to determine what resources and specific direction you need. "
How can I prepare for the later stages of chronic kidney disease?,"The answer to this question depends somewhat on the stage of <a href=""/procedure/chronic-kidney-disease-1002"">chronic kidney disease</a> that you are currently in and any other medical conditions that you have.  If you are otherwise healthy, then you have the potential to keep the kidney function that you have and not progress to ""end stage renal disease"".  This is the stage where dialysis often becomes necessary.  Some people can have stage 1 chronic kidney disease for their whole life and never need dialysis. 

If you have other conditions such as heart disease then you have a greater chance of progressive to end stage renal disease.  In this case the best thing you can do is keep from consuming too little or too much fluids.  The right fluid balance is the best thing you can do to keep your kidneys from getting worse.  This will require help from your physician that is caring for your chronic kidney disease.  

If you do progress to end stage renal disease, then you will want to do what you can to increase your chances of moving up on the transplant list while on dialysis.  This will include not missing any doctor's appointments, taking all of your medicines exactly as prescribed, and avoid illegal drugs and tobacco.  

I suggest that you discuss this issue with a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a>.  He or she will be able to give you the best advice to your specific stage and cause of renal failure. "
What causes chronic kidney disease?,"Chronic kidney disease can be caused by a wide variety of problems. In the US, diabetes and <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a> are two very common causes. Other etiologies include primary problems of the kidneys themselves, such as scarring of the kidney cells as seen in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, or inherited syndromes such as Polycystic Kidney Disease. Autoimmune diseases can also lead to chronic kidney disease, as is the case in Lupus. Often, a <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a> of the kidney will be needed to help determine the exact cause of the decline in kidney function.

The kidneys play a major role in the body's regulation of acid/base status, electrolytes and blood pressure. Subsequently, chronic kidney disease may lead to electrolyte derangements such as high potassium and phosphate, elevated acid levels, and elevated blood pressure. These problems can cause non-specific feelings of fatigue, poor appetite, itching, headaches, and nausea. If the electrolyte disturbances become severe, then  irregular heart rhythms can occur. Increased loss of protein in the urine can cause foamy urine, and can lead to elevated cholesterol levels and increased swelling all over the body. For all of these reasons, it is important for patients with chronic kidney disease to maintain regular follow-up with a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> (kidney specialist) who can monitor serial blood and urine tests and vital signs and tailor therapy appropriately."
Are kidney stones causing blood in my urine?,"Kidney stones are certainly one cause for blood in the urine (hematuria). The stones can irritate the lining of the kidney's collecting system or of the ureters leading down to the bladder, causing minor trauma and bleeding which spills into the urine. This may be associated with pain, which can localize either to the kidneys or radiate down to the groin or to the scrotum. 

Another cause of blood in the urine to consider is a <a href=""/procedure/urinary-tract-infection-1005"">urinary tract infection</a>. These can be identified on a routine urinalysis and confirmed with a urine culture. In men, it is important to consider inflammation/infection of the prostate when a urinary tract infection is identified, as a simple UTI is rare in otherwise healthy young men without a history of structural urinary disease or recent instrumentation. 

If you have not seen your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> recently and he/she is unaware of your hematuria, then you should seek follow-up care. If you continue to have blood in the urine and it is thought to be a result of your kidney stones, then you may need referral to a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> who can talk to you about different types of interventions to help break up your stones, if needed. "
Why I get kidney stones every year after taking all the precautions?,"I am sorry to hear that you have been experiencing problems with <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a> for such a long time. Definitely recurrent kidney stones is a condition that should be thought about more carefully. I would suggest talking to either a nephrologist (<a href=""/nephrologists"">kidney doctor</a>) or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if they are comfortable working up this problem. 

Basically, there are multiple different types of kidney stones. Although it is true that some stones form just because of dehydration and not taking in enough liquid, others form because of genetic predispositions. Some form because of underlying medical problems, like inflammatory bowel disease. The best thing to do is to have an analysis of the chemicals in your urine and in the stones in order to get a sense for what your urine is like and what is inside the stones. This is important, because it will help your doctor determine whether dietary modifications or other treatments could possibly be put in place to decrease the probability that you will keep having recurrent kidney stones. 

Again, I suggest starting with your primary care doctor. They will either perform the workup for you or will refer you to a nephrologist to complete the workup. "
Could poor kidney function cause many adverse effects (side effects) from many medications?,"The answer to your question depends entirely on the type of medication that you are referring to.  Medications are metabolized or eliminated by the body by different mechanisms including by the liver, the kidneys, the lungs, and the blood.  Many drugs have elimination by more than one mechanism.  In drugs who's main mechanism of elimination is the kidneys, special dosing is required.  If this dosing recommendation is not taken, then it is possible that you will have high (perhaps to high) levels of the drug in your system.  If this is the case, then you will likely be more susceptible to drug side effects.  

I imagine that you probably have a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> that you see for your reduced kidney function.  If not, I would suggest that you schedule an appointment with one.  A nephrologist can discuss how impaired your renal function is (it may not be that impaired) and how this will effect any medications that you are currently on.  In addition, this will give you a go-to person to ask pertinent questions to about new medications that you are placed on.  This way, you can be sure that you are not being over or under dosed with any new drugs you need to take.  "
What are reasons for my kidneys to be hurting?,"Sudden pain is always of concern, especially if it worsens or persists or is accompanied by other concerning symptoms, like fever or nausea and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>. I recommend talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. 

One concerning possibility would be <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a>. These manifest as severe pain in the flank which moves into the abdomen and down the leg, sometimes to the groin. Classic of kidney stone pain is that it is crampy in nature and comes and goes, with periods of severe pain alternating with episodes without pain. I am particularly concerned about this possibility, because kidney stones sometimes occur more frequently in people who are experiencing rapid weight loss or dieting. 

Another would be a kidney infection, also known as pyelonephritis. This usually begins as a urinary tract infection with the typical symptoms of burning with urination and then progresses. Kidney infections have severe pain in the abdomen or in the lower back just under the ribs. Often there is fever as well. 

It sounds like you should call your primary care doctor as soon as possible to help you figure out what is going on. If fever or severe pain returns, you should go instead to the emergency room. "
How do I prevent a UTI from reoccuring?,"Recurrent urinary tract infections are a common complaint. Especially in women of your age, this is a frequent problem. I recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss this.

In general, a woman's anatomy predisposes women to infections. The urethra (the flow tract from the bladder to the outside) is very short and therefore it is easy for bacteria to get from the outside to the bladder (known as an ascending infection). In general, hygiene is important. One thing we teach young girls is that it is important to wipe after defecation from front to back (not back to front) to keep fecal bacteria from getting to the urethra. Men have much longer urethras (in the penis) therefore are less likely to get infected. 

The other common suggestions we make are what you are already doing. After sex (post coital) urinary tract infections are very common. Urinating before and after intercourse is important to limit the standing urine that can become infected.

The two things I would discuss with your doctor is (a) is there a chance you have a renal <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a> (the same bug is in the kidney so constantly infects you and (b) if suppressive antibiotics are needed. Many people with recurrent infections simply need to take antibiotics every day or after every sexual encounter to prevent infections.

Please talk to your doctor."
How will my dialysis treatments affect my daily activities?,"It sounds like you have lived a great life while managing your systemic lupus erythematous.  Hemodialysis three days a week (the usual frequency) can significantly affect one's life in several ways.  First, hemodialysis, as you know, takes 3-4 hours per session 3 days per week.  This is a significant time period that most people would rather be doing other things.  Secondly, some people feel quite tired after their hemodialysis session, while others actually feel better.  Depending on how hemodialysis affects you, this may be more time that is ""taken away"" from activities and things that you'd rather be doing.  Finally, depending on the vascular access that you have (fistula, graft, or tunneled venous catheter), some activities may be limited.  You could imagine that getting a tunneled catheter caught on something could be quite painful and messy.  This also provides a portal for infection.  Despite all of these things, most hemodialysis patients end up living very full and productive lives with minimal limitations other than the time commitment.  I do recommend that you contact your <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> to have a frank discussion about hemodialysis and how you can best maximize the activities that that you wish to pursue."
How does a renal ultrasound work?,"Renal <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> is a common procedure. It is an important test to diagnose problems with the kidneys and urinary system. I strongly encourage you to talk to your <a href=""/nephrologists"">doctor</a> to further understand this test and the risks and benefits of it.

In general, the renal ultrasound is a very easy test. Luckily, it does not (normally) involve things being inserted. There are variations of the ultrasound test, but the basic one requires no injections or insertions.

Ultrasound is an imaging modality that uses sound waves. Essentially, the sounds waves are sent into the body by a small handheld probe. These waves are not audible (you can't hear them). The body and its different tissues will reflect or absorb the sound waves depending on the composition of the tissue. The same probe that sends the sound waves also catches the reflected waves. This allows for the computer to make a picture of what type of tissue is present. In the renal ultrasound, the probe is placed on the back and the stomach to look at the kidneys and the vessels that feed it. Similar ultrasounds are done in pregnant women to look at babies. It is a painless (besides the probe on your skin) and safe (safe enough for babies!).

Good Luck!"
Why do I experience extreme exhaustion?,"Daily exhaustion must be a very frustrating way to live.  It also sounds like you have been to see multiple different physicians and had significant testing which has not shown a specific reason for your symptoms. As hard as it is to not know why you feel so unwell, the best thing for you to do is try to find a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> you trust and with whom you feel you can have a good working relationship in the years to come. Although it is impossible to diagnose you without speaking with you in person, performing a physical exam, and reviewing your laboratory and test results, it sounds as though some of your symptoms could be related to a disorder called fibromyalgia or possibly an alternate diagnosis called chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue, as the name implies, can make you very tired and uncomfortable all of the time. Notably, fibroymalgia patients also suffer from fatigue as well as chronic pain in specific parts of the body.  

Unfortunately, even though patients with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue do experience very real symptoms, there is not a specific treatment that makes all of the symptoms go away. The key to treating these disorders is a strong patient-physician relationship, the use of specific medications for pain and sleep, and often incorporating regular exercise into daily life. If your symptoms are due to one of these disorders, it is important that you continue working with your <a href=""/chiropractors"">doctor</a> because improving your quality of life will take time."
What is causing this very bad pain in my right hip above the pelvic bone?,"This pain is definitely something that you need to get checked out. I recommend going to talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or, if you have one, your orthopedic doctor. 

It is not clear from your question how old you are. However, in older adults, wear and tear arthritis in the hip joint (also known as osteoarthritis) is a serious and common problem. Therefore, if you are getting up there in years, this would be the first thing I would think of. Pain in the groin and knee could all be caused by a hip problem, as pain from the hip often will radiate out to those locations. Your doctor will probably want to start by getting some plain x-rays of the hip and pelvis, as these can often help make a diagnosis of arthritis and rule out other common problems. It may also be worthwhile to have your <a href=""/procedure/scoliosis-spine-deformation-1214"">scoliosis</a> reevaluated, as sometimes progressive scoliosis will cause progressive back pain, which may also radiate down and involve the hip. 

In addition to helping diagnose the problem, your doctor will be able to give you advice on treatment options, which could include anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy or, even, <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> in more advanced cases. Make an appointment with your primary care doctor or your orthopedic doctor today."
What is the cause of the liquid discharge coming from my ear?,"This is an important question to discuss with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;doctor. There are many different things that could be causing this problem, and I am sorry that you have had to deal with it for so long. First, lets start with the most common problem: ear wax. I would say most of the time that people tell me that they have had fluid coming out of their ear, it is wax that has gotten moist, or is other fluid that somehow got in their ear and is draining. Other common problems, and those that need to be treated, include recurrent ear infections. Obviously, this is not a normal phenomenon in and of itself, and so it should be treated appropriately. There may be pain or decreased hearing associated with the infection as well, which would also be warning signs. Finally, one of the most concerning things would be if there is a cause for recurrent infections, such as a skin cyst that can form in the middle ear when there have been repeated infections in the past. Doctors call these cholesteatomas, and they usually need to be removed surgically. As you can see, there can be many causes for your draining ear. Please speak with your doctor to find if there is anything more that can, or should, be done."
I still notice some side effects after recovering from bells palsy- what type of doctor should I see for a follow-up?,"I am sorry to hear that you have suffered from Bell's palsy, and am quite happy for you that your symptoms have almost completely resolved. There are 2 types of doctors that would best be able to help you: a neurologist and an otolaryngologist-head and neck <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (or ENT). Either would have some experience with treating your problem, although they would likely approach it in a very different fashion. <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">Primary care doctors</a> would see fewer patients with this problem, and your chances of finding someone who is knowledgeable would be reduced without seeking help from a specialist. As for finding one via ZocDoc, it is certainly possible to locate docs and find out a little bit about them, but most of them don't specifically comment on a certain problem that is so rare. Generally speaking, <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologists</a> will be more worried about your nervous system and what happened there, is it fine, etc. An ENT is more likely to worry about things that could be done to improve your symptoms, such as a weight for your eye, or other interventions that may be needed. Please speak to your doctor, as referrals can also be invaluable. "
" I have swelling under my eyes and pressure in my sinuses, will a CT scan help to see why?","It sounds like your symptoms have been quite bothersome for some time and you should discuss them with your physician.  Presumably with the antibiotics and the steroids your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> is treating you for chronic sinusitis.  Unfortunately, in some patients a sinus infection can become a prolonged affair, with a time course similar to yours.  In many cases this is because there is some kind of anatomic abnormality with the sinuses that makes it hard for them to drain properly.  As you can imagine, if the drainage passages in the sinuses are blocked or too narrow to permit good drainage, you can have a smoldering infection in that area that causes symptoms for an extended period of time and is very difficult to eradicate.  At this stage, a <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a> of your sinuses seems very appropriate to first of all confirm a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis (which is easily and very well evaluated by CT) and make sure that there isn't something else causing your symptoms.  Second, a CT scan can give your doctor significant information about whether there is an underlying anatomic reason for your symptoms, in which case surgical intervention is sometimes the best approach to help eliminate an infection and prevent its recurrence.  It sounds like your CT scan is a very sound decision.  You can continue to discuss your management plan with your physician, and with the help of a CT scan hopefully you can move ahead with a plan to get your symptoms under control."
Why do I have orange mucus coming from my nose?,"I am sorry to hear that you are in the middle of this unfortunate <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>. The good news is that you do seem to be getting appropriate medical care, and I would advise you to continue to follow up with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a>. Most often, after treating you for <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a>, your doctor will want to see you again shortly to make sure that the infection has been treated appropriately and that you are doing better. Now, orange mucous can be a sign that you have a sinus infection, although it is only one sign. Often, if you are recovering from one illness and start to have more symptoms of increased nasal drainage, nasal congestion, or other nasal complaints (such as the tooth pain that you are describing), this could be a sign that you have developed a secondary sinus infection. If you have no other symptoms, then you should be able to follow up with your doctor as previously arranged for your pneumonia. Some people will find that a few days of using a nasal saline irrigation, coupled with over the counter nasal sprays such as Afrin, will yield significant benefit. Make sure not to use the nasal spray for more than a few days, however. Please speak with your doctor for more information and full follow up from your pneumonia and new symptoms. "
Why do I have pressure in my ear all the time?,"Your ENT <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> is probably correct that this pressure in your ears is from enlarged tonsils, if that is what the physical examination showed. Basically, what happens is that the small tubes (called eustachian tubes) that equalize pressure and drain fluid from the middle ear to the back of the throat become compressed by the enlarged tonsils, since they exit directly behind the tonsils in the back of the throat. This caused trouble with fluid and pressure buildup in the ears, which is called eustachian tube dysfunction.

If the only cause is recurrent tonsil infections or persistent tonsil enlargement, then <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> is definitely the best option to relieve the problem. At the same time, it may be that you have other additional problems that are contributing to the eustachian tube dysfunction. These might include either chronic sinus congestion or chronic nasal allergies. It might be worth talking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to rule out these two conditions, because these are easily treated with simple medications. Treatment might provide some relief while you are considering whether or not you want to go ahead and proceed with surgery. 

Book an appointment with your primary care doctor for some more advice, and good luck!"
"""If people have opposite sex features, such as a masculine physique, what treatment is available?""","This can be a difficult problem to deal with, and I am sorry that you have had to suffer through this disruption of your social life. Fortunately, there are many things that can be done to help, but the problem is that you may need to speak with specific <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctors</a> to find one who is interested and able to help.

With regards to masculine features of the face, there are steps that can be taken to soften the face and make it more feminine. Starting conservatively with makeup and simple things, more advanced options can include injections and fillers to provide a more feminine cosmetic appearance. The ultimate in aggressive therapies can include craniofacial surgeries that are designed to alter the nose, profile, and forehead and can ultimately be very successful. There are even surgeries and procedures to help make the voice more feminine, if that is needed.

Other parts of the body can be addressed in similar manners, with the caveat that all of these are unlikely to be covered by insurance and may be associated with some expense. A facial plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or other plastic surgeon is often a good place to start, and speaking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> may provide additional insight."
What should I do if my tonsils have sores?,"I am sorry to hear that you are continuing to have difficulty with this. I recommend discussing the issue with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a>. Tonsil sores could be from many different things, and the most likely possibility for you might be different than it would be for someone else. If you are young and otherwise healthy, there is a good chance that they are either some sort of low grade infection or something that is otherwise not terribly concerning (one possibility includes tonsil stones, or tonsilliths, which are little impactions that can be made when food packs into the crypts in the tonsil). You don't seem to mention any other complications or effects, such as pain or <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, which leads me to believe that you are just noticing them rather than suffering from them. If you are older and are noticing continuous sores on your tonsil (or anywhere else for that matter), it would make your doctor think about different possibilities. Much of what your doctor thinks and does depends on who you are and what is most likely for your age group. Also, what they look like would be important. Again, please speak with your doctor about these sores."
What is strep throat?,"If you are concerned that your child may have contracted strep throat, please speak with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> about whether or not it would be appropriate to treat him. Strep is a very common infection that can be passed quickly from one person to another. Almost all of us have had at least one encounter with this (either personally or with/through a family member), and can remember how terribly painful it is to even just swallow. It is caused by a common bacteria, a streptococcus, that can sometimes live in the tonsillar crypts (the little pits that some people can see in their tonsils) even when the patient is not ill. For most people that get the infection, however, it will cause a <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, some bumps in the neck (reactive lymphadenopathy), a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, and can also cause some other types of infections by the way that the body can react in fighting the infection. For that last reason, most people are treated with antibiotics and have an excellent response over a very short amount of time. For a small minority, the infection can go on to cause either a local or a systemic reaction that may need to be treated more aggressively. Again, please talk to your doctor if you believe your child may have strep throat."
Are my headaches caused by a sinus infection or something more serious?,"If your headache is still persisting after this much time, it may be wise to speak with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> (or another, right?) about your complaints. Given that you are having so many symptoms and that they have been lasting about a week now, it may be appropriate to start with some antibiotics or other medications that can help to reduce your symptoms. That is, assuming that you really do have a sinus infection, which is assuming a lot. There are many possible explanations for the symptoms that you are having, but one of the common ones is certainly a sinus infection. Unfortunately, <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctors</a> often have a hard time diagnosing these infections, as they do not have the proper equipment and have to rely on the patient's description of his or her symptoms. By visiting with an ear nose and throat <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (or ENT for short), he or she would be able to better diagnose and treat your complaint. They would likely do that by placing a small camera inside of your nose to see how bad things are. Additionally, they are very used to treating this condition. If it is a sinus infection, they will know how to treat it, and if it's not, they can get you headed in the right direction. Please speak to your doctor or an ENT as soon as you can."
Why can't I smell or taste anything?,"It sounds like you have had a terrible few months at this point, and should be seen by an otolaryngologist-head and neck <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (or ENT, for short). He or she would best be able to diagnose the cause of your lost sense of smell and other complaints. This is important, because the longer the sense of smell is gone, the less likely you are to get it back. That is because unless you use that sense, you lose it. As it has already been some months, I would suggest being seen sooner rather than later. He or she will likely use a camera to diagnose what is going on. This small camera would allow him or her to look into your sinuses and determine if there is an infection, and then to see if there is a cause for continued drainage from them. Also, they would see if there are any nasal polyps. These polyps often come in response to allergies or other sinonasal inflammation, and often need <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to be removed. The cost of surgery would be very dependent on your insurance and the coverage that you have and other variables. Please speak to your ear nose and throat surgeon as soon as possible."
What is causing my sore throat and earache?,"There is a saying in medicine that common things are common. If that saying is true, then it is most likely that you have had a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract (also known as a URI) that is taking its time to resolve. I recommend you speak to your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> about this issue.

Most often, these infections will be the cause of the fluid in the ear, as there is some swelling of the Eustachian tube (the path of drainage from the ear to the back of the throat) which prevents it from draining. When this happens, there is otalgia (<a href=""/procedure/ear-pain-463"">ear pain</a>) that can be either from the ear itself or from another site in the head or neck that is inflamed because of the recent infection. The ear is very sensitive to this sort of thing because of the excellent innervation that it receives from so many different nerves in the body.

Your doctor sounds like he or she has prescribed the appropriate medications and has made all of the right steps thus far. The next step, if your symptoms don't resolve, is to continue working with your doctor to find out why not. An ear nose and throat <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> may also be able to help. Please speak to your doctor."
Can tea tree oil relieve earache even with ear tubes?,"Tea tree oil is a commonly used alternative medical remedy. The oil of the tea tree does have some anti-pain and antibiotic properties. However, it is also highly irritating. As such, it should not be placed in body orifices without consulting with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a>. It should especially not be placed inside the ear canals when ear tubes are present, as the oil could get into the middle ear through the ear tube, where it could cause significant inflammation and irritation. 

Rather, what your grandmother should do is consult with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or her ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a> about what to do about this pain. Ear tubes are often put in to the ears when there is a chronic collection of fluid behind the ears that causes pressure and pain and trouble hearing. Therefore, if your grandmother is having pain in the ears again, this might be a sign that the ear tubes have fallen out or become clogged. This is something that her doctor should be able to tell with a simple examination of the ear canal using an otoscope. If the tubes are malfunctioning or if they have fallen out, her ENT doctor will be able to advise her about whether or not they should be replaced. Book an appointment today."
Why do I feel like I'm going to vomit when I swallow saliva?,"The one thing that is most notable from the CT scan image that you uploaded is that one of your submandibular glands is enlarged, from what looks like a stone blocking the gland duct. This could potentially be related to your symptoms, and is definitely something that I would suggest following up with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> about, especially since a lot of your other testing has been negative. The specialist who would be best qualified to tell you whether or not this enlarged gland might be the cause of your symptoms -- and, if so, what to do about it -- would be an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a>. 

The other specialist who might be able to help you, especially if the ENT doctor does not think this finding on the CT scan is clinically important, would be a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>. The sensation of trouble with swallowing can sometimes be investigated more closely with an endoscopic evaluation, where a small camera is passed down the throat to look at the structures in the throat, esophagus, and stomach. This is a straightforward examination that can usually be done with a small amount of medication to make you feel like you’re sleeping, and a gastroenterologist will be able to discuss with you whether it is worth pursuing. Make an appointment today!"
Can a slap cause permanent tinnitus or a brain tumor?,"I would definitely recommend that you go back to see your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> and mention this to them. You could start with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who can perform a basic examination of your ear and of your hearing. However, depending on what they find, they may want to refer you on to see an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a> for further evaluation. 

Tinnitus, or ringing in the ear, can be a sign of damage to the inner ear. It can occur from trauma, such as a blow to the head, and it is therefore feasible that you could have sustained some damage from the slap that you received. Your doctor will be able to formally assess whether or not you have had any damage to your hearing and, if so, whether or not there is anything that needs to be or can be done about it at this time. 

Also I would highly recommend discussing with your primary care doctor, in confidence, the situation that led up to getting slapped in the first place. If you are at all in danger of repeated violence from people that you are close to or that you are living with, this is an issue that your doctor can help you with."
My left ear has been popping for a few days and I can't hear out of it. What should I do?,"I would recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It does sound like you have something going on inside the ear, and your primary care doctor will be able to examine things closely and help you figure out what you need to do. 

The most likely possibility is that you have some fluid built up behind the ear drum. This is called a ""serous effusion"" and it can occur after an upper respiratory infection or in setting nasal allergies or sinus congestion. Generally, serous effusions do not need any specific treatment as they tend to get better on their own; however, it is good to have a diagnosis, because more chronic cases may need referral to an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat specialist</a>. 

Another possibility is that you may have wax buildup in the external ear canal. When this occurs, this can lead to trouble hearing. It is less likely to cause the 'popping' sensation that you are feeling than fluid behind the ear, but it is still a possibility that needs to be resolved. 

Your doctor can take a look inside your ear and throat and reach a diagnosis. If medications are necessary, they will be able to provide them for you. Please schedule an appointment soon!"
I have this constant feeling something is stuck in my throat. What can this be?,"It sounds like you have had a pretty good initial workup. The sensation of feeling like something stuck in the throat is concerning, because it can sometimes indicate a serious problem, such as a tumor. However, these serious problems should be ruled out by the swallowing tests, endoscopy, and ENT evaluation you have had, which is excellent news. However, after ruling out these serious causes, many people with this problem (which is known medically globus pharyngis) are frustrated by not knowing exactly what is going on. Continuing to seek help and input from your ENT <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;doctor or from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> is the best way to begin to eliminate causes systematically. 

Most likely, your doctors will first want to focus on completely eliminating smoking. Smoking is one of the most common causes of your symptoms, and it will be difficult to proceed until a good trial of smoking cessation has been completed. 

Other causes that your doctors might consider would include chronic acid reflux (causing irritation in the back of your throat) as well as chronic nasal allergies or sinus drainage. Both acid reflux and sinus or allergy problems can be treated with medications, and your doctors may wish to trial some of these treatments. Please be sure to schedule an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible!"
What's causing my ear bleeding?,"I strongly suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a> as quickly as you can to figure out what is going on. 

It is not entirely clear from your question exactly how you cleaned out your ear, but I suspect that you may have scratched or otherwise damaged the inside of your ear when you cleaned it. Hydrogen peroxide alone shouldn't cause any trauma, but if you used a cotton swab or other object to scratch or scrape the inside of the ear, then it is very likely that you caused some damage. 

The main thing your doctor will want to do is look inside the ear with an otoscope. This will allow them to tell if there are any scrapes or other damage to the ear canal. Importantly, they will take a close look at the tympanic membrane (ear drum) which is sometimes punctured when people try to clean their ears too vigorously. It is especially important to rule out damage to the ear drum, as this can cause permanent trouble with hearing. 

Call your doctor's office and make an appointment to be evaluated as soon as you can!"
Itchy but not painful ears... how soon should I seek help?,"Although this doesn't sound like an immediate medical emergency, I would definitely recommend that you follow through with your plan to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. 

There are two possibilities which seem likely to me. The first is that you simply have a buildup of wax in the external ear canals. This frequently causes itching and, if it is severe, it may also cause some trouble hearing. Wax buildup is treated with either direct removal of the wax with a small tool or irrigation with warm water. Your doctor can perform both of these procedures for you if necessary. 

The second is that you have an infection of the external ear canal, known as otitis externa. This also tends to cause itching, as well as drainage from the ears that may have a strong odor. Otitis externa is typically treated with good cleaning of the ear canals together with topical antibiotics and steroids to reduce swelling and kill off the infection. 

If you develop <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, severe <a href=""/procedure/ear-pain-463"">ear pain</a> or swelling, or any other concerning symptoms, you should go see your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room for a more immediate evaluation. Again, please see your doctor soon. Good luck!"
Ears itchy on and off - why?,"It sounds like your plan to see an ENT specialist is a good one, as there are many possible causes of your symptoms. 

Definitely eustachian tube dysfunction, where the tubes draining your middle ear down into the back of your throat do not function properly is a possibility. This would cause a ""plugged up"" feeling in the ears as well as a pressure feeling. Eustachian tube dysfunction would also be more common in someone with your history of multiple ear infections, which could have caused scarring of the middle ear or tubes. 

Another possibility is a build up of wax inside the outer ear canal. This can definitely be severe enough to cause trouble hearing, and it also very commonly causes an ""itchy"" sensation inside the ear canal. 

It is unlikely that your <a href=""/procedure/eye-infection-100"">eye infection</a> issue is related to you plugged up ears. However, when you go to see your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;doctor make sure to mention the eye issue to them as well, as I am sure they will be happy to take a look at that in addition to investigating your ears.

Based on what the ENT doctor finds, they will be able to recommend the appropriate treatment. For example, eustachian tube dysfunction can sometimes be improved with medications, and ear wax buildup can be removed in the doctor's office. Good luck!"
Why is my ear clogged up?,"I strongly recommend that you see either your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or a ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat specialist</a> about this issue, if you have not already done so. Chronic clogged sensation in the ear is often a treatable condition, and the first step is figuring out what is going on. 

One possibility is that you have a chronic serous effusion in the ear. This can develop after a bad cold, throat infection, or sinus infection. It can also occur as a result of eustachian tube dysfunction, where the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ear down into the throat do not work as well as they should, or chronic sinus or nasal allergy problems. 

Another possibility is that you have a serious buildup of wax in the external ear canal. Some people have very over active glands in the ear canal that produce an excess of wax. If not taken care of, this wax can easily occlude the entire ear canal leading to trouble hearing. 

Your doctor will be able to tell the difference between these two conditions quickly with a simple physical examination. Allergies and other causes of serious effusions can often be treated with simple medications. Wax buildup usually just requires removal with a special tool or with irrigation in your doctor's office. Again, please see a doctor soon."
"My right ear hurts, but why?","<a href=""/procedure/ear-pain-463"">Ear pain</a> can be caused by many different things, including diagnoses that may not involve the ear itself.  Sometimes pain can be referred to another part of the body when the problem is actually somewhere else.  From what you describe there are several possible explanations for your pain.  First, you may have an intrinsic ear problem (too much wax buildup in the external ear canal; a middle or inner ear infection; fluid buildup behind the ear drum).  Your physician should be able to examine the ear with an otoscope and tell whether or not there is evidence of either an external or internal ear infection, or excess wax that could contributing to your symptoms.  However, it is also possible that you are experiencing pain in your ear that is originating from your jaw or even your teeth.  The temporomandibular joint is exactly where you describe your pain, and if that joint is not aligned properly then opening and closing your mouth past a certain point and biting down on food can be very painful.  Tooth problems in the upper jaw can also radiate pain to the area you describe.  

The best thing for you to do in this situation is start with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for a thorough history and exam.  Your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> should be able to evaluate your ear, and if no abnormalities are noted there, it may be helpful for you to see another specialist to continue the investigation."
I have nasal polyps high in my nose. What should I do?,"Unfortunately, your ENT <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> is right that one of the complications of nasal polyp removal <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> can be a disturbance in smell function. This is especially the case of the polyps are very high up inside the nose. 

Most of the time polyps are caused by chronic inflammation or irritation inside the nose, such as might develop from chronic nasal allergies or sinus problems. Therefore an anti inflammatory treatment, such as the prednisolone drops you are using, might be part of an effective therapy. However, it would be worth touching base with your doctor about this again, either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your ENT doctor, to see if there are additional treatments that might be needed to maximize the healing. 

Also, rarely, chronic nasal polyps are sometimes a sign of another underlying medical condition, such as cystic fibrosis, which can sometimes be diagnosed late in life with no other major symptoms. This is something else that it might be worth asking your primary care doctor about. 

Finally, if no treatments with medications are effective, then you can go back to the ENT doctor to reevaluate whether or not surgery makes sense in your case after all. 

Good luck!"
Is it safe to drink water while my nose is bleeding?,"There shouldn't be any problems with you drinking water while having a nosebleed.  Any time you have a nosebleed some of the blood may drain down the back of your throat into your stomach, and this can give you a bad taste in the back of your throat or make you nauseous.  Drinking water is not generally a problem in this setting.  However, the bigger issue here seems to be why you are getting such significant nosebleeds.  It is a good idea for you to discuss this with your physician.  He or she may want to see you in the office for a brief history and physical exam.  He or she may also want to check some basic labs, depending upon the results of your exam.  An incidental nosebleed here or there or in the setting of trauma is not a big deal, but in general, most people do not have large spontaneous nosebleeds without something else going on.  In order to make sure that you don't have some other underlying process, your physician will likely want to get more details about your recent health history, any other new symptoms you may have noticed, as well as a complete list of the medications you are taking. Again, please talk with your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a>."
Any home remedy suggestions to unplug a clogged ear?,"Ringing in the ears can be very frustrating, and it sounds like these symptoms have been bothering you for quite some time.  It is quite possible, as you suggest, that your ear symptoms are related to the sore throat and sinus congestion you had in the recent past.  However, given that your symptoms have persisted in the ear and you are now noticing some hearing loss, the best thing for you to do is visit your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> so he or she can evaluate your ears on exam and may consider the option of sending you to an <a href=""/audiologists"">audiologist</a> for more sophisticated hearing assessment or to an ear/nose/throat specialist.  It is possible that you may simply have a substantial buildup of ear wax in the affected ear, and removal of this wax may eliminate all of your symptoms.  However, there are also a number of other conditions that can affect the outer and inner ear to cause some of the symptoms you describe.  In order to make sure that your health is protected in future, it is important to eliminate any treatable causes of hearing loss and the other bothersome symptoms you describe.  In this situation, the rest of your health history will also likely be very helpful, as prior illnesses can sometimes have effects on the hearing many years later. Please talk to your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> soon."
How will an ENT Specialist examine the eustachian tube?,"It sounds like your primary <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> has done a good initial job with this issue. Indeed, allergies  or <a href=""/procedure/sinus-problems-116"">sinus problems</a> are one of the more common causes of stuffy ears or ""eustachian tube dysfunction."" Often these can be treated just as was done in your case, with nasal irrigation and with a nasal steroid spray. The fact that your symptoms have improved a lot sounds to me like you and your doctor may be on the right track, and hopefully things will continue to get better. 

If not, going to see an ENT doctor for additional workup is a good idea. There are several additional causes of eustachian tube dysfunction that they will be able to consider, including scarring of the eustachian tubes. The investigations that they will perform will likely include looking closely inside your ear at your ear drum. They will also want to look closely at the back of your throat, potentially with a small camera. Finally, they may want to get an audiogram to assess the effect of the tube dysfunction on your hearing. Based on what they find with these tests, they will be able to make recommendations about what other treatments might be needed."
What time should I take prednisone &amp; will exercise affect my rapid hearing loss?,"Sorry to hear that you are having this problem with your hearing. Prednisone is often used in cases of rapid sensorineural (nerve related) hearing loss, and it is often quite effective at slowly this loss by reducing whatever presumed inflammation is causing it in the first place. 

Many times, when prednisone is prescribed, it is given out in small tablets, which allows gradually reducing the dose in some cases (this is called a prednisone taper). For this reason, at the beginning of the taper you may be taking quite a few pills (such as 6 per day). Generally, these pills can all be taken at the same time every day, and the time of day is not usually very important. However, sometimes the prednisone is taken twice a day and there also are a few situations where taking it at a specific time of day is important. For these reasons, I recommend that you talk to the <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> who prescribed the prednisone for you in the first place; since they know your case best, they will be able to answer these questions for you. When you talk to them, you can also ask about any other restrictions, such as going to the gym. "
My voice is hardly getting clear!,"You definitely need to see your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> about this as soon as possible, if you have not done so already. Start with seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They can perform the initial evaluation and help determine whether or not you need to see a specialist. 

First, your doctor will want to rule out the common causes of raspy voice. These include smoking, seasonal allergies, or chronic sinus problems. If one of these things turns up on the history and examination, your doctor will probably want to treat that for a few weeks to see if it makes a difference. 

If not, however, you will need a referral to see a ear, nose, and throat specialist. They can use a special camera to take a look down your throat at your vocal cords to see what might be going on. For example, one common problem is polyps on the vocal cords, which can cause many of the symptoms you are describing. Rarely, a chronic raspy voice can be a sign of a cancer in the throat, although this is quite uncommon in someone your age; nevertheless, the ear, nose and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a> will be able to rule this out as well when they take a look down your throat. "
Why does my mom get dizzy when she drives or after she eats and drives?,"I would definitely recommend that your mother get additional evaluation to try to figure out what is going on. It sounds like some of the really bad things have already been ruled out, because a CT scan or MRI scan of the brain would detect a brain tumor or something like that. 

However, there are many causes of chronic dizziness. If she hasn't had a problem with her heart ruled out, that is definitely something that should be checked off, likely with a visit to either her <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> or her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. 

Assuming that is negative, the next stop might be a ear, nose, and throat doctor. Many of the chronic causes of dizziness are related to inflammation of the inner ear apparatus. These conditions include labyrinthitis, vestibulitis, benign positional vertigo, and Meniere's disease (although Meniere's disease is less likely if she had a normal hearing test). The ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat specialist</a> should be able to evaluate for these conditions and help determine whether any additional testing is needed. Many cases of chronic dizziness do not have any specific cure, but medications to help control the dizziness may help your mother out quite a bit. "
How to get food out of nasal cavity?,"Sometimes small pieces of food can get lodged in the nasal passages, usually when you suddenly and unexpectedly cough or choke while eating. Sometimes, however, there is nothing stuck there at all, but rather it is just irritation of the nasal passages from the choking incident that creates the sensation of having something stuck. 

Assuming you are not having any trouble breathing or talking, then this is not an immediate medical emergency, and you could try sitting quietly for a little while to see if the sensation subsides. You could also try blowing your nose, as that may sometimes dislodge any stuck food particles. 

Of course, if you are having trouble breathing, you should call an ambulance and get immediate help in an emergency room. Also, if the sensation doesn't subside or if the food particle does not dislodge, then you will need to get help from your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> to take a look inside your nose and throat to figure out if there is something there that needs to be removed. An ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a> is the person best qualified to do this, as they can take a look inside with a special small camera. If you have an ENT doctor, you could call them directly or, alternatively, go to an emergency room which will likely have an ENT doctor on call. Good luck!"
Does high blood pressure cause nosebleeds?,"Nosebleeds are never normal, but are usually never associated with <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, or high blood pressure medications.  Nose bleeds can have many different causes.  The most common cause is trauma to the nose itself.  This can be from blunt trauma (such as getting punched or falling into a wall) or from picking.  Another cause of nose bleeds is dry air.  If people breath dry air especially at night, this can make that anterior (forward most) blood vessels more likely to break and bleed.  Finally, a common cause of nose bleeds is the use of blood thinning medications (often combined with one of the above two).  Examples include warfarin (also called coumadin), plavix, and dabigatran.  These medications may be associated with nose bleeds.  

If your friend is having recurrent nose bleeds, then she should schedule an appointment with an ear nose and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a>.  This is the type of physician who will be most equipped to examine the nose and determine the location of the bleed.  In addition, he or she can review your friend's list of medications to make sure there is no medications that could be the cause of these bleeds.  Finally, the ENT doctor may want to do some simple blood tests to make sure she doesn't have a <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> disorder.  "
How do you cure patulous eustachian tube dysfunction?,"Sorry to hear that you are having such a problem with this issue. This is a good question to raise with your ENT. Patulous eustachian tube dysfunction, as you mention, occurs when the tubes remain permanently open. This is less serious than dilatory dysfunction, where they remain closed. Dilatory dysfunction causes symptoms like pain and stuffiness in the ears, whereas the only symptom of patulous dysfunction tends to be autophony. 

There are no perfect medical treatments for patulous dysfunction. Steroids and anti histamines are of no use for this condition, although some people are taking them when they are diagnosed because of concern from their <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctors</a> that there may be an allergy component. For some people, dehydration is a major trigger for symptoms, and staying well hydrated can be an effective treatment. 

On the other hand, persistent or very severe patulous dysfunction usually requires a surgical intervention. There are several different surgical techniques that are used, but all of them essentially involve partially or totally occluding the eustachian tubes. 

I recommend that you talk to your ENT doctor to see whether or not they think that a surgical treatment is right for you at this time. 

Good luck!"
Is it normal for ear infection pain to come and go?,"I suggest that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue, especially since the pain seems to be bothering you quite a bit and is interfering with your work. 

Given that you are an adult, the likelihood of this being an actual <a href=""/procedure/ear-infection-111"">ear infection</a> is quite low. True ear infections are much more common in children than in adults. 

What is more likely join on is that you have a collection of fluid behind the ear drum, which tends to occur because of clogging of the eustachian tubes which normally function to drain fluid from the ear into the back of the throat. Eustachian tube dysfunction, or clogging, typically occurs with an upper respiratory infection, but it can also occur with allergies or sinusitis. 

Your doctor can look in your ear and determine whether you have a true ear infection or just fluid behind the ear. If you do have an ear infection, they can prescribe an antibiotic for you. On the other hand, if this is just fluid behind the ear, then they can prescribe you medications to help with the pain and also to help open up and drain the eustachian tubes so that you you can start feeling better. "
What causes dizziness only while lying on back?,"<a href=""/procedure/dizziness-&lt;a href="">vertigo</a>-468""&gt;Dizziness can have many different causes, and usually a medical evaluation by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> is necessary to get to the bottom of things, especially if the dizziness persists or worsens. 

Nevertheless, there are some clues in your story that point more towards certain types of dizziness than others. The fact that the dizziness was strongly related to position (it went away when you changed positions) means that it might be something known as benign postural vertigo (BPPV for short). This is a condition in which small stones get lodged in the position sensing canals inside the inner ear, causing severe dizziness with certain positions. 

There are, however, other common causes of dizziness. One of these is an inflammation of the inner ear called labrynthitis, which is usually caused by common viral infections. Certain prescription medications can also cause dizziness, as can dehydration and alcohol consumption. Finally, there are rare but serious causes of dizziness, such as problems with the heart rhythm, that can be ruled out by a doctor. 

I suggest making an appointment with your primary care doctor, who can perform a complete examination and help figure out if this needs more workup. They can also prescribe you medication to relieve the dizziness, if necessary."
When I hold my head down and eyes closed I get dizzy?,"Having a sensation of <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> with changes in position is a relatively common problem. For example, if you have your head in a position lower than the rest of your body, you may have a sudden increase in blood flow to the brain that causes a sensation of dizziness. On the other hand, if you suddenly stand up, you may have rapid pooling of blood in the legs and a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which can also cause dizziness. The solution to these symptoms is to avoid these extremes in position and to avoid standing rapidly when changing position. 

Another cause of dizziness with changes in head position is something called benign positional <a href=""/procedure/vertigo-115"">vertigo</a>, which is caused by small position sensing stones in the inner ear getting ""stuck."" This form of dizziness is usually more severe than the kind of dizziness provoked simply by blood pooling, as the sensation of ""spinning"" is usually more pronounced. 

I suggest that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about the issue, especially if the symptoms are persisting. They will be able to figure out if your symptoms come from one of these common, and relatively benign, causes, or if there is something potentially more serious going on that needs further investigation. "
Dizzy for years - why?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are having such trouble with dizziness and that you haven't been able to figure out exactly what is going on. Unfortunately, dizziness can sometimes be a very difficult medical symptom to sort out. 

Of course, the first thing that your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctors</a> have done is tried to rule out the more serious causes of dizziness, which are related to your heart. The fact that you have had a normal echo, normal stress test, and normal Holter monitor are all very reassuring that your heart is healthy!

Now that heart issues are off the table, I would suggest that you go back to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or which ever other doctor is coordinating your care for this problem. I say this because the next steps will include investigating other potential cause of the dizziness, which include trouble with your inner ear, medication side effects, and trouble with your autonomic nervous system. 

Your doctor will be able to review all of your current symptoms and your past medical workup and make recommendations about which tests need to be performed next. They may wish as well to refer you to additional specialists, such as a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> or an ENT doctor."
What is causing my lightheadedness and near-fainting?,"I definitely agree with you that persistently feeling light headed is not normal, and it definitely seems to be interfering with your day to day functioning. It does sound like you have had a pretty good workup so far, which at least has ruled out all of the major serious problems, such as vasovagal fainting (tilt table test), tumors in the brain (MRI), seizures (EEG), and heart problems (stress test, EKG). So you should at least feel reassured by these findings, although that is not the same as saying that you are making up the symptoms or that there is nothing going on. 

Unfortunately, dizziness without an identifiable cause is a very common problem, and sometimes we cannot always specifically figure out what is going on. The one set of possibilities that does not seem to have been investigated yet is that you might be having something going on in your ear as a cause of your dizziness. You may want to see an ear, nose, and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat specialist</a>, if you have not already done so, as they can evaluate you for those causes. If you do not already have an ear, nose, and throat <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a>, I am sure that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be happy to make the referral for you. "
Why would I have enlarged lymph nodes?,"Sorry to hear that you have been having such bad headaches, and that you had an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of your head that incidentally found enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. As you are probably aware, there are hundreds of lymph nodes in your neck. Lymph nodes are part of your lymphovascular system that collects fluid that leaks out at the junction of your arteries and veins at the tissue level. Lymph nodes have immune cells within them, and when something is identified that causes an immune reaction (like a virus), the lymph nodes will get larger due to activation and hypertrophy of immune cells. There are systemic effects from autoimmune disorders (which can be part of some connective tissue diseases) that can cause lymph node swelling. There are numerous other causes of lymph node hypertrophy; if there is an infection in an area that the lymphovascular system is ""draining"", those lymph nodes can be swollen. Also, lymph nodes can at times act like ""filters"" when there is a cancer in the body. If the cancer has individual cells that break free into the lymphovascular system, they can be caught in the lymph nodes. If they grow in those particular lymph nodes, they will be larger and continue to grow. This is called ""lymph node metastasis"". I don't want to scare you, because there are other reasons for having lymph node swelling, but I wanted you to be aware of some of the serious causes. It sounds like you are on the right track going to an ENT to get checked out. They will do a thorough exam, take a good history, and go through your MRI with you to help determine why there is swelling of the lymph nodes. I recommend trying to get a copy of the MRI (on CD) that you can take with you to your ENT appointment, because it will be helpful for them to look at the actual film and not just the ""read"". Best of luck. "
My infant son has a lump behind his ear. Why?,"Sorry to hear that you have recently noticed a lump behind your infant son's ear. I recommend that you take your child to an <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">otolaryngologist</a> (aka ENT, or Earns Nose Throat physician) to get them checked out. It would even be better if there is a fellowship trained pediatric otolaryngologist around you (this is someone that specializes in disorders of the head and neck in children alone). There are a number of different possibilities as to what might be causing a lump behind your son's ear, however your physician is going to want to know a lot more information. For instance, was it there at birth, does it change in size, is it pulsatile (can you feel a heartbeat when you touch it), has your child been sick recently, etc... They will also want to examine the area thoroughly which will help to narrow down what they might think it is. After taking a history and doing a thorough exam, it is likely that they will order an imaging study to help evaluate the lesion (something like an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>, or a <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a>). As I mentioned, there are numerous different possibilities as to what the mass could be, anything from an enlarged lymph node, an abscess, or an embryologic remnant called a branchial cleft cyst. I hope this helps, and I wish you all the best as you work through figuring out what is going on with your physician. "
Why won't this canker go away?,"Any time there is a sore anywhere on your body that does not get better with time, there is always the concern that there could be a serious cause, such as cancer. It would be important to know more of your history, such as whether or not you have a history of smoking or drinking, as this makes it much more likely that there is a serious underlying cause. Even without those, however, just the fact that it has persisted for so long indicates that you would do well to have the spot biopsied. The fortunate thing is that this can be performed easily in your doctor's office, who can then look at it under a microscope to make sure that there is nothing more aggressive than a normal canker sore that is causing your pain. Things to look out for include increasing pain, increases in the size of the lesion, changes in your voice or speech, pain radiating to other parts of your body, or weight loss (although there are other symptoms, too). Please speak to an <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;otolaryngologist, or head and neck <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> (ENT), who will best be able to help you determine what is happening inside your mouth. "
Can I repair an old cartilage injury?,"While there are many kinds of injury that can occur during a car accident, the specific area that you are describing is one that does not usually have any cartilage present in the adult, but instead has only bone and the supporting musculature (although the thyroid and tracheal cartilage are present slightly lower down on the neck). While it is good that you have not suffered from pain throughout this time, the fact that you are continuing to have symptoms suggests that you should speak to your <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">doctor</a> about your complaint. The general area that you are describing could be referring to your hyoid bone or to some of the cartilages described above, none of which are easily injured due to their nature and the natural recoil that they have derived from their location. An <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">otolaryngologist</a> (ear-nose-and throat <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>) would likely be best able to help you understand what you have been suffering from for all of this time, and would likely be able to direct you towards the appropriate care at this point. Please speak to your ENT in the near future, and discuss with him or her what steps can be taken to improve both your symptoms and the cosmetic results of your accident. "
"I have a small umbilical hernia of about 1cm that doesn't cause me pain, should I get it treated? ","Small hernias are a common occurrence, but should be discussed with your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>. A <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a> is the term that is used to describe a small amount of bowel that has pushed through the wall that usually keeps it housed in the abdomen. These can happen either around the belly button, in the groin, or in other regions. Many people have them, and at some point it is often recommended that they be treated. This is because, when left untreated, the bowel can be pinched off by the abdominal wall, leaving a pocket of bowel without adequate blood supply or drainage (incarceration). For most people, the repair is a very straightforward surgery where the tissues of the abdominal wall are reinforced and closed to prevent the bowel from prolapsing through the wall. There is certainly a chance that the hernia could come back after it is repaired, as this part of the bowel wall is weaker than the rest of the abdominal wall. The sutures that would be used would usually be absorbable sutures in several layers, and these would generally not be a problem with wound healing. There is some scarring around these stitches, and that scar helps to provide strength. These are all excellent questions to discuss in detail with your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. Please speak to your doctor. "
What can cause dry peeling skin on the fingers?,"You definitely have some peeling of the skin at the fingertips as well as some redness in the area.  There are many things that can cause this sort of thing, including vitamin/mineral deficiencies, an allergic reaction to something (contact dermatitis), exposure to an irritant, some infections (especially slow-growing fungal infections of the skin), or a skin condition such as <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a> or <a href=""/procedure/psoriasis-87"">psoriasis</a>.  This kind of condition can be very distracting and problematic from a cosmetic standpoint, and you undoubtedly want to get to the bottom of this right away.  A <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> would be the best person to start with for an evaluation of not only your fingertips but also the rest of your skin and your health history.  You may have other skin findings or symptoms that will help identify what is causing these changes on your hands.  In addition to identifying what is causing this, a dermatologist will also be able to recommend the best treatment, whether an oral or topical medication.  Determining which cream or lotion is likely to be most effective for your dry and peeling skin will depend upon what is causing this.  Hopefully your hands will be back to normal soon, without any recurrence in future!"
How can prevent my face from being extremely oily?,"I am sorry that you are having to deal with this. While it may not seem like it or make it any better, you are not alone. Oily skin is a very common complication. Fortunately, there is much that can be done. The normal things, such as adequate sleep, a healthy diet, and maintaining your overall health are, of course, vital. After that, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> may have some specific products that can help. Facial cleaners are excellent to start with. Your doctor may also suggest an over the counter medication such as salicylic acid, which can help to remove excessive dead skin and keep pores open. Do make sure to moisturize your skin with a high quality (which does not mean expensive) water based product, which almost seems counter intuitive. This cleaning and moisturizing may also help with some of the blackheads that you are describing. If even that doesn't work, there are still many directions to turn. There are many prescription medications that can help to keep your skin healthy. Retin A is a common and very popular medication, depending on the degree of blackheads and oily skin that you are suffering from. In short, speak with your doctor, because there is much that can be done. Good luck!"
What are these red bumps on my stomach?,"This certainly sounds bothersome!  As you can imagine it is quite difficult to diagnose a rash or skin lesion without being able to see it and I am glad you have an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to have a more thorough assessment.  That being said, there are a few potential diagnoses that come to mind based on your description:
1) Contact dermatitis: is it possible that you only have these bumps when you wear certain clothing, or a certain belt that may rub on your abdomen in that particular area? If so, this may be a contact dermititis, which is a skin allergy to some material or chemical that your skin is coming in contact with.  If the bumps are itchy or irritating, that would go along with this diagnosis.
2) Heat rash (medical term 'miliaria rubra'): although atypical, it could be that this particular area of your body is predisposed to heat rash, which is a follicular rash caused by obstructed sweat glands.  If possible, try to keep the area cool and dry and see if your symptoms improve.
3) Scabies: this is less likely, but potentially your rash could be caused by a scabies infestation.  Normally this would be intensely itchy and would have a linear pattern.
I hope you find this helpful.  As you prepare for your upcoming appointment, taking pictures of the rash at different stages and bringing these photos in to your office visit may be helpful for your primary care <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>."
Is it okay for a woman to use Rogaine foam for men?,"This is an issue that you will have to discuss with your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor, or whoever is helping you treat your thinning hair. Minoxidil (Rogaine) is approved by the FDA for use in women in the 2% concentration, which is the ""Rogaine for Women"" lotion that you are probably using. ""Rogaine for Men"" is available in both lotion and foam form, but at a higher concentration of 5%. This higher concentration, which is the only concentration at which the foam is available, is not officially approved for use in women. 

That being said, there are many doctors who do prescribe the higher concentration for women, especially if they have failed treatment with the lower concentration. The main danger of doing so is that there is a greater risk of side effects, such as scalp irritation or hair growth elsewhere on the body, with the higher concentration. 

Your doctor will be able to discuss this issue with you and help you decide whether or not the foam 5% formulation of minoxidil would be appropriate for your situation, when balancing all the various factors, including both the risk of side effects and convenience or ease of application.

What can cause bald patches on the skull?,"I would definitely recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. The first thing they will want to do is to see if the balding is occurring in a typical ""male pattern baldness"" fashion. If so, then there is unlikely to be any other underlying medical condition, other than a predisposition to baldness, and they will be able to discuss with you the various treatments that are available for slowing down and/or potentially reversing the hair loss from male pattern baldness. 

On the other hand, if the pattern of hair loss is not consistent with male pattern baldness - for example, if it is occurring in isolated round patches on the sides of the head - then they will need to consider other causes. For example, fungal infections of the scalp can cause baldness, as can various inflammatory skin conditions like eczema or <a href=""/procedure/psoriasis-87"">psoriasis</a>. There is also a condition called alopecia areata, which is an autoimmune form of hair loss that has a distinct look on physical examination, and that may require intervention if it does not spontaneously resolve. 

Start by making an appointment with your primary care doctor (or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, if you have one) for evaluation."
"Why are my feet and hands always freezing cold and sweaty, while the rest of my body sweats excessively?","I agree with you that this degree of sweating that you are describing is quite excessive, and you should get it checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to see what might be going on. 

The first thing your doctor will probably want to do is rule out a problem with thyroid gland, as this is a common cause of excessive sweating. Other symptoms of a thyroid problem might include <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, heart palpitations, or changes in your skin or hair. Thyroid problems can be ruled out with some simple blood tests. 

If your thyroid is normal, then your excessive sweating is probably due to a condition known as hyperhydrosis, which is a condition in which, for genetic reasons, you are predisposed to excessive sweating. This condition can be controlled in various ways. For example, there are prescription strength topical antiperspirants that work by ""clogging up"" the sweat pores and thereby reducing sweat output. Additionally, sometimes oral medications to ""dry up"" the sweat production can be used. In more severe cases, referral to a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> to consider other treatments, such as injections of botox, can also be considered.

"What is this painful, red, pea-sized lump between my hip and butt?","Since this spot has been present for such an extended period of time without getting better, it is definitely time to have a <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> look at it, so that they can help you figure out what might be going on. You could start by going to see either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, if you have one. 

There are several different possibilities. One is that this could be an infection of the skin, such as a boil. Sometimes, these can last for quite a long while, especially if there is a collection of pus under the skin, as this will not go away unless it is opened and drained. 

Another possibility is that this might be a cyst under the skin, which could become reddened and painful if it was secondarily infected, or simple from the constant pressure of sitting on top of it. Cysts are benign, but they do often need to be surgically removed, because of the pain or because they continue to grow in size. 

Your doctor will be able to take a look and help you figure out what to do next. If there is an infection, you may need the area opened up and drained, or you may need a prescription for antibiotics. Book an appointment with your primary care doctor or your dermatologist today."
"Why is my face oily in the morning and dry at night, and how can I treat it?","This is an issue you should discuss with your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It is possible that your face is drying out after swim practice mostly because the water in the pool (and especially the chemicals used to disinfect the water) are making your face dry and flaky. If this is the case, then moisturizing your face immediately after practice might be the best way to avoid the problem. 

Interestingly, if your skin becomes dry and irritated, this can stimulate an overproduction of oil as a natural protective mechanism. In other words, your skin might be oily in the mornings precisely because it is dry and irritated at night, and using a moisturizer might break the cycle. 

Again, you should mention this issue to your primary care doctor or your dermatologist. They can take a look at your skin to make sure this is not a more significant skin problem, such as <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, which might require treatment other than moisturizing. Also, they can make recommendations about other skin products that might be useful to you, especially if this problem continues to persist. 

Make an appointment with your doctor today."
How can I treat a popped a cyst on my face? ,"First and foremost, the critical thing is to avoid picking at or squeezing the cyst in any way. This may be tempting, but it will just perpetuate the cycle of inflammation and delay healing. It may also introduce bacteria into the wound, which could lead to a skin infection. 

I would recommend showing this to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, especially if things haven't cleared up yet. They will be able to take a look and figure out, first, whether there is any localized skin infection that might need to be treated with antibiotics. If not, they will also be able to give you advice on topical medications you might use to speed healing. 

Furthermore, your doctor can talk to you about preventing these sorts of issues in the future. I assume that the cyst developed from a bad spot of <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>. If so, then starting to use a daily skin treatment regimen to control your acne might be the best way forward. There are a number of excellent prescription medications that can be used to control acne and prevent the formation of cysts, and your doctor will be able to discuss these with you. Make an appointment today!

Good luck!"
"What are these red itchy spots on my thighs, chest, back, hands, and butt?","You should definitely go back to see your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor about this issue. Alternatively, since the issue has been going on for such a long time without resolution, you could seek help from a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. 

Permethrin is a cream that is used to treat infection of the skin with scabies, which can certainly cause the types of red itchy spots that you are mentioning. Scabies can be difficult to treat. Sometimes, even when properly diagnosed, the condition may not go away with permethrin, in part because the bug that causes the scabies may cling to bedclothes and clothing. Therefore, reconsidering whether this still might be scabies, failing a first treatment with permethrin, is definitely in order. 

Another condition which is sometimes overlooked by doctors that can cause red itchy bumps are bedbugs, which are becoming more and more of a problem these days in certain parts of the country. Similarly, in households with pets, flea bites can occasionally be a problem. 

Additionally, a number of conditions not related to infestations are also possible, including eczema or an allergic reaction of the skin. 

Your doctor will be able to take a look at these spots and help you figure out what to do! Make an appointment today!"
Should I have this bruise-like mark looked at?,"I would definitely have this spot on your skin checked out by either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or by your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. The first thing your doctor will be able to determine is if this is a <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> and, if so, if you have any other signs of bruising or bleeding elsewhere on your body. This is an important thing to figure out, as there are several different disorders that can lead to easing bruising and bleeding. 

Assuming this is not a bruise, then the next important thing will be to make sure this is not a form of skin cancer. New marks on the skin that do not go away or that grow or change need to be checked out for this reason. The most serious form of skin cancer is something called melanoma and, although most melanomas are black or blue in color, sometimes they can be brownish or reddish in color. 

If your doctor suspects a skin cancer, they will want to set you up to have a biopsy of the skin are. This is often something that can be done quickly in an office setting, depending on the size of the spot. 

Please set up a visit with your doctor as soon as you can. "
"What are these itchy, irregular red bumps that come and go, often after a shower?","If you have already been to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this a few times without figuring out what is going on, then it might be time to make an appointment with a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, who should be able to help you get to the bottom of this. One thing that would be very helpful, in preparation for this visit, is to take photos of the bumps with your phone or camera, since it seems like they tend to come and go and might not be present when you actually go to your dermatology appointment. 

It sounds like you've already ruled out a lot of things, such as a reaction to a new soap or other personal care product. A mild form of <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a> would still be on my list of possibilities, since this often will ""flare"" after a warm shower. 

Also, it is important to consider bites, particularly bed bug bites, which are classically intermittent and very itchy. They also are something that can be easily overlooked in the workup for this type of skin condition. The fact that your boyfriend also has them makes this perhaps a more likely possibility. 

Start by making an appointment with a dermatologist!"
How can I reduce under-eye puffiness?,"Under-eye puffiness is a very common problem that can be a cosmetic concern for many people. The skin under the eyes is very delicate and thin, which allows the veins to show through, giving a dark discoloration. As we age, the skin becomes even thinner, allowing this discoloration to become more prominent. This can be accentuated even more by age-related sagging of the skin at the same time. 

It is worth going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> because there are a couple of medical problems that might make the problem worse, including chronic nasal or seasonal allergies. If there is any evidence of allergies, it is worth treating them for a while, because often clearing up the allergies will also make the skin under the eyes appear less dark and less puffy. 

On the other hand, if there is no evidence of this, then your options include using makeup or skin creams to try to improve the appearance or consulting with a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> or a cosmetic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. They will be able to discuss the more invasive treatment options, which include injecting fillers, laser-based skin treatments, and surgery itself. Again, please discuss with your doctor. Good luck."
Worried about mole that fell off?,"I would definitely go to see either your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> about this issue. The main concern with moles is that they contain collections of pigmented cells, known as melanocytes. Sometimes, these melanocytes can begin to grow and proliferate out of control, leading to a type of skin cancer known as melanoma. 

For this reason, any mole that changes significantly in size, color, texture, etc needs to be examined by a doctor to rule out the possibility of a melanoma. Generally speaking, after the examination, if your doctor is at all concerned that this might represent a melanoma, they will order a biopsy to remove the involved area. This is a simple procedure which is usually done in the doctor's office with some local numbing medicine; the procedure rarely takes more than a few minuted and does not usually have any major complications, other than a small scar at the site of the biopsy. 

If the biopsy comes back normal, then there will be no need to worry further about the issue. However, you will need to keep an eye on other moles and let your doctor know if you notice anything suspicious. 

Contact your doctor's office as soon as you can. "
What are these painful bumps on my face and chest?,"I suggest that you go to see a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> about this issue, as they will be best qualified to help you figure out how to solve this problem. 

In the meantime, while you are waiting to see the dermatologist, you should avoid picking at these areas or squeezing them to remove the hard core. This might lead to more rapid resolution of the bumps, but it also causes very significant inflammation in the skin and will worsen the scarring quite a bit. 

I think the most likely possibility is that this is cystic <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>. I know that you already have other bumps and blackheads consistent with simple acne, as you mention in your question. Cystic acne occurs when the 'simple' areas of acne become sufficiently inflamed that hard, painful nodules develop. 

It is also possible that you have an ongoing follliculitis, or deep skin infection, which was not properly treated with with last course of antibiotics that you took. 

Your dermatologist will help you figure out what to do. For example, if this is cystic acne, you will probably need to use several topical medications simultaneously, and your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> will also probably consider starting an oral acne medication. If this is a skin infection, then another course of antibiotics might be needed. Please be sure to talk to your dermatologist soon!"
Why do I have surgical scars that keep looking like bug bites and itching?,"I would recommend talking to your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> about this issue. You could either see the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who has performed the laparoscopic surgeries for you, or you could consult with a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. 

One possibility is that some of these scars are still in the process of healing. This is especially likely if you notices that it is mostly the more recent scars that are swelling or itching. Scar healing is a very complex process which can take many months. Over time, a scar will tend to thicken initially and then begin to retract and become smaller. This process is often associated with itching and other strange sensations. 

Another possibility is that your are developing some keloids. Keloid is an overgrowth of scar tissue, sort of like a ""callus"" at the site of an old wound. Sometimes keloids can become quite enlarged, and they may be itchy or uncomfortable, principally because they rub against clothing. 

Finally, you could have an area of skin inflammation, such as an skin allergy or eczema, which just happens to be overlying some of your areas of old scar. 

Regardless, the first step is to see your doctor. They can help you decide what the most effective treatment will be!"
Are these bug bites?,"I would definitely take your son to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> to have these skin sores looked at. Especially since he is the only one in the family who has them. There's not really such a thing as ""sweet blood"", which means one of two things: (1) Either these are bug bites of some sort, and your son has a more severe reaction to them than your other children; or (2) These are not bug bites and instead are some other skin condition, potentially related to his other medical problems. 

It is definitely the case that some individuals react very strongly to flea or other insect bites, results in severe redness, swelling, or itching. In this case, if his pediatrician thinks this is what is going on, then it may be necessary to prescribe a topical or oral medication to relieve the symptoms and speed healing. 

On the other hand, there are several other skin conditions that need to be ruled out. For example, people with diabetes may be more prone to skin infections by bacteria than other people. Similarly, people who have celiac disease sometimes suffer from a blistering skin condition called dermatitis herpetiformis. 

Your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> will be able to consider these and other possibilities, so make an appointment as soon as you can!"
I have three black spots on my upper shoulder. Why?,"I suggest that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> for help figuring out what this is, as there are a couple of different possibilities. 

First, it would be important to make completely certain that these spots were not there before. I say this because moles (dark pigmented spots in the skin) are very common. We can sometimes miss them if they occur on parts of the body that are hard for us to see (like the back of the shoulder, for example). Your doctor would be able to confirm if this was a mole with a quick examination. 

Second, if the spots are new and recently formed, then they could be a form of a skin infection. It would be  important to tell your doctor if you have noticed any drainage from the spots, swelling around the, <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, or pain, as these would be other symptoms more consistent with infection. 

Your doctor will examine the area closely and help figure out what is going on. If these are just moles, then they may advise you just to follow them closely to make sure they do not grow or change. If this is an infection or inflammation of the skin, you may need topical or oral medications to help clear it up. "
"What is this pink, raised bubble between my genitals &amp; buttocks, where a mole used to be?","This description you give is a bit unusual, as it sounds like you've developed a blister in this area where you previously had a mole. I would suggest that you go see a <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>, as you will need to have someone look at the area to make a diagnosis. You don't necessarily need to see a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> for this. If you have a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at your school, or even an urgent care center, they should be able to fit you in and help you figure out what this might be. 

Ruling out a sexually transmitted infection is of course important, although the location you describe would be a bit unusual. However, if you have been having anal intercourse, then a sore in this area might be more expected. Herpes is the sexually transmitted infection which is most likely to produce a blistered sore, although syphilis can also produce sores or ulcers. After examining the area, your doctor may want to send some basic blood or urine tests to rule out these possibilities. 

If this turns out not to be a sexually transmitted infection, then it could simply be a blister (from irritation of the skin, for example) or some inflammatory skin condition. Your doctor, if they think this is what is going on. will give you additional advice about how to manage this. Good luck."
Is it ok for me to put gel nails on a nail with a crack in it?,"It would be best to have your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, take a look at the nail to see what is causing the cracking prior to deciding to put on gel nails. There are a couple of different reasons for this. 

First, if the cracking is caused by any sort of nail fungus, then placing a gel nail on top of the area might lead to worsening of the infection, since it will create a humid environment for the fungus to proliferate. Furthermore, if the nail is infected with a fungus, then it might be worth while considering a medication to help clear up the infection, and this is something that your doctor can discuss with you as well. 

Second, in addition to fungal infections, there are other causes for brittle or cracking nails, such as thyroid problems and various nutritional deficiencies. It is important to make sure that you don't have a serious or treatable condition as the cause of your <a href=""/procedure/nail-problems-192"">nail problems</a>. 

Finally, in the event that this is just brittle nails, it still might not be advisable to apply gel nails, since the adhesives and chemicals can lead to more breaking or cracking. 

Your doctor will be able to provide you with good advice!"
Poison ivy won't go away?,"This is a question for a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. Contact dermatitis from exposure to a plant like <a href=""/procedure/poison-ivy-or-poison-oak-506"">poison ivy</a> or poison oak can be very painful, itchy, and generally ruin an otherwise enjoyable outdoor experience.  It sounds like you've done exactly the right things so far when it comes to following up with a physician about your symptoms.  However, the symptoms of poison ivy have typically resolved within 4 weeks so it is a little unusual that you are still having symptoms.  There are several possible explanations for this.  First of all, although it sounds like you undoubtedly had a poison ivy exposure 4 weeks ago, you may also have an allergic reaction against something else that is still in your routine environment.  Second, you may be developing a secondary bacterial infection (cellulitis) in the area where you initially had the poison ivy outbreak.  Third, depending on what kind of creams you have been using, you may have developed a reaction from the steroids.

Overall, the best thing for you to do is go back to the dermatologist for a re-examination.  He or she should be able to assess the area and help determine what is going on and how you should continue to treat the rash and irritation."
Is it okay to use two types of Tretinoin cream a day?,"Since there are questions about whether or not you got the right prescription from your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, I think the most prudent thing to do would be to call her office right away. On the phone, you can explain your concerns that you might have been accidentally given the same prescription twice. If this is the case, I am sure that she will be able to fix the issue and get you a new prescription right away. You can also get any other questions you might have about how to use these medications answered at that time. 

It would be unusual to use two types of the same product at the same time on the face for <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>. Usually, the typical approach to facial acne is to use several topical medications with different mechanisms of action at the same time, with the idea that this helps to attack the acne from multiple different angles and improves the chances of success. 

Therefore, your question needs clearing up. I would avoid starting to use the new prescription until you can get in contact with your dermatologist and get your question answered to your satisfaction. 

Good luck! I hope you have success getting your acne to clear up!"
Why do my shoulders burn in the sun faster than other parts of my body?,"There is no particular medical reason that I can think of that would cause the shoulders to burn more rapidly than any other part of the body, assuming equal sun exposure. 

Therefore, I think it is more likely that your shoulders are burning more rapidly than other parts of your body because they are getting more direct sun exposure! For example, if you are standing up or walking around outside, the sun will directly strike your shoulders but only indirectly strike your legs or your stomach - resulting in more rapid burning. At the same time, the shoulders are harder to evenly apply sunscreen to than are the legs or stomach as you cannot see them as well, and this could also be contributing to your sunburn. 

I would recommend talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> to see if they have any recommendations about specific sunscreen products. Also, they will be able to give you general advice about protecting your skin from sun damage, which is one of the major causes of accelerating skin aging and also a risk factor for the development of skin cancer. 

Please talk to your doctor!"
I have extreme dark under eye circles genetically. How can I get rid of them?,"This is a good question to raise with your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. You are right that this problem is often genetically determined. Basically, the skin under the eyes is very thin, which allows the veins full of blood in that location to be very prominent and show through, creating the dark discoloration. Most of the time there is not a great deal that can be done to get rid of this problem, although a dermatologist may have some suggestions after an examination and it would be worth making an appointment with one. 

There are a couple treatable causes of dark circles under the eyes. These include chronic sinus congestion and nasal allergies. When the <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> examines you, they will likely want to give you medications to treat these conditions if they find any evidence that you have them, as they are the few things that, if well treated, can result in significant improvement in the dark discoloration. 

The other important thing that can help is to prevent any damage to the skin that would cause it to age or thin out even more rapidly. Principally, this means avoiding sun damage to the skin, which you can do by avoiding direct sunlight and using a good sunscreen. 

Talk to your dermatologist, who should have more specific recommendations!"
I have a bump that looks like a white pimple on my lip?,"I would definitely show this to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at your earliest convenience, as they should be able to help you figure out if this is something you need to be worried about. I think the fact that it hurts and is a little inflamed today is not very helpful as a clue, because you were squeezing it yesterday which is likely the reason for the discomfort today. 

One possible cause is something called a mucocele, which is a sort of small cyst filled with secretions that tends to form in the mouth following minor trauma, such as biting your lip. Generally mucoceles will go away on their own and don't need treatment but sometimes if they are large they do need to be removed. 

Ruling out cancer is also a good idea, especially if you have risk factors for a skin cancer (such as lots of sun exposure or fair skin). Your doctor can determine if the bump has any characteristics concerning for cancer and, if so, they will likely recommend a <a href=""/procedure/biopsy-416"">biopsy</a>, which is a simple office procedure that can remove the spot and send it to be checked out. 

Please set up an appointment with your doctor. "
I have excessive sweating on the left torso. What should I do?,"It sounds like your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> thought that the sweating was due to hot flashes from menopause, which is indeed a common problem. However, with hot flashes, the sweating really should come uniformly from different parts of the body and not be localized to just one half of your torso. If this is really the case, then it makes hot flashes less likely as a cause. 

In fact, isolated problems with sweating that only affect one part of the body are quite unusual. They can sometimes be caused by an autonomic neuropathy, which is a condition in which some of the nerves in the body that regulate temperature become inflamed or damaged. It may also be a sign, more rarely, of an inflammation in the brain or of a mass pressing on some of the nerves as the exit the central nervous system. For this reason, I think it is important that you have additional evaluation. A <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> may be able to confirm the isolated problem with sweat production, although if the problem is confirmed you may also need to see a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> for further examination and work up. Your general practitioner should be able to make the necessary referrals for you. "
How long will it take for my skin to return to its natural tone?,"I strongly recommend that you go to see a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> about this issue as soon as possible to see what can be done. In the meantime of course, you should discontinue use of whatever fade cream that you were using, as it seems to be causing problems. 

Most fade creams work by exposing the skin to certain chemicals which ""bleach"" color out of dark areas of the skin. However, sometimes these chemicals can be quite irritating to the skin, causes a dermatitis or inflammatory type of reaction. When inflammation sets in to these areas of the skin, it can lead to a phenomenon called post inflammatory hypopigmentation, or lightening of the skin. Sometimes, when the irritating product is discontinued, this post inflammatory hypopigmentation will gradually improve and the skin color will return to normal. However, sometimes, the change in skin color may be permanent. 

Start by getting in to see your dermatologist. They can confirm the diagnosis of what is going on with your skin. They can also determine if there is any treatment, such as a topical steroid cream, that you can use that might help to return your skin to its former color or prevent further depigmentation of the skin. "
How do you determine if you have athlete's Foot?,"If this was a mild case of athlete's foot, which is a fungal infection of the skin on the feet, then you would probably have noticed some improvement with the anti fungal spray. However, one caveat is that sometimes the fungus can be resistant to these over the counter anti fungal medications, so failure to improve with over the counter anti fungal medications doesn't necessarily completely rule out a fungal infection. 

However, I do think it is time to get your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>'s opinion, since you have already tried treating this on your own without much luck. Your doctor can consider other possible diagnoses, other than just athlete's foot. These could include dyshidrotic <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, which is a form of eczema which causes peeling of the soles of the feet and can be quite stubborn and difficult to get rid of if you do not use a prescription strength steroid cream. 

Your doctor will take a look and determine whether they think this is more likely to be eczema or athlete's foot. If the latter, they can probably prescribe you a stronger anti fungal medicine, since the first one you tried has not worked. If the former, they will definitely prescribe the necessary steroid creams for you. Good luck. "
I have red bumps all over my leg and they are getting worse.,"There are a couple of different possible causes here, but the fact that they are persistent and getting worse suggests that you should probably go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> for help getting to the bottom of things. 

Ingrown hairs are definitely a possibility, although it seems like you have experience with those and these seem different to you. Another cause which sometimes can look similar to an ingrown hair is folliculitis. This is a condition in which bacterial infection sets in at the base of the hair follicles, leading to redness and discomfort. Some mild cases of folliculitis can be treated with just good skin hygiene or topical antibacterial ointments, but many more advanced cases do require oral antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor. 

Another potential cause, especially if the red bumps are mostly on the upper half of your legs, your thighs and your buttocks, is keratosis pilaris, which is an inherited benign condition of the skin in which small plugs of keratin are produced and clog off pores in the skin. Keratosis pilaris can be easily diagnosed by your doctor and it doesn't require any specific treatment (because it is benign), but the appearance of it can be improved by exfoliation and other treatments that you might use for common <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>. 

Please talk to your doctor. "
I have weird red bumps on my wrist?,"If this has been going on for a while and not getting better, then it is time to see your <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>. Either your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should be able to look at these bumps for you and tell you what is going on. 

One possibility is that this is eczema. Eczema is a condition in which the skin becomes dry, red, and itchy in patches. It often occurs on the hands and wrist, commonly due to frequent hand washing and exposure to chemicals such as those found in soap. If this does turn out to be eczema, it is generally easy to treat with topical steroid creams, as directed by your doctor. 

Another possibility is contact dermatitis, which occurs when the skin develops an allergic reaction to something it has come into contact with. Contact dermatitis looks a bit different from eczema, but it is treated in much the same way, by avoid irritants and using steroid creams to relieve itching and speed healing. 

Poison ivy and hives are also on the list, as you mention, although these do tend to be a bit more widely distributed and not just limited to the wrist. Regardless, your doctor should be able to figure this out easily!"
what can I put on my upper lip if there are bumps and pus?,"It sounds like you have developed a pretty significant reaction of the skin on your lip after this facial mask, with many bumps as well as a large amount of drainage. This reaction could be contact dermatitis, or an allergic reaction of the skin to something in the facial mask. It could also be an infection of the skin, because some facial mask treatments are irritating to the skin and may help bacteria to gain entry and set up an infection. 

Because the symptoms are relatively severe, I would strongly recommend that you have a <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>, such as your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>, look at this rash as soon as possible, rather than trying to treat it on your own without a diagnosis. I say this because the treatments for the different causes, contact reaction versus infection, are different from each other and using the wrong treatment could make the issue worse. 

Contact dermatitis is typically treated with steroid creams to reduce redness, itching and inflammation and speed healing. Infections, on the other hand require antibiotics, either oral or topical, depending on the severity of the problem. Using a steroid cream on an infected area of the skin could make it worse, which is why you need your doctor's help. "
Is this a Staph Infection?,"The three medications that you are using are all medications that are generally used to treat <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>, and they are very effective for this. From your question, it sounds to me that you recently saw a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> who put you on these treatments. What I suggest is that you talk to that <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a> again as soon as possible, so that she can clarify for you exactly why you are taking these medications.  

It is important to clarify this because the treatments for acne and frank staph infections of the skin are different; staph infections are more aggressive, and they require stronger medications in most cases. Sometimes a bad case of acne can become super infected with the staph bacteria, and this can result in a worsening appearance and the need for stronger treatments. 

What I would suggest, therefore, is that you have your dermatologist look again at your skin to help you figure out what is going on. Make sure to let them know if you think you have noticed any change in your skin's appearance with the medications they prescribed, as that information will help them decide what to do next. 

Contact your dermatologist as soon as you can!"
Why do I have tiny skin colored bumps on my nose?,"This is a great question to raise with your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>. It sounds like you are probably noticing nothing more than the skin pores on your nose. These pores contain glands which produce a large amount of oil and other lubricating substances, much more so than most other parts of the body. Sometimes, this material may ""plug"" the pore leading to the formation of a small bump. When squeezed, these plugs of material can usually be easily expressed, which is the yellowing or whitish material you are seeing. Sometimes, when the material sits in the pore for a while, the end of it exposed to the air may turn black, which are the tiny black dots you are seeing. 

This is not a major medical problem, although for some people it can be a cosmetic issue. Since the underlying problem is plugging of the pores, this can generally be treated in much the same way you would treat <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a> - with gentle skin cleansing, exfoliation, etc. Again, please talk bout this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your dermatologist."
Is this acne or a rash?,"I'm sorry to hear that you have had so much trouble recently with this facial rash! I will say that it sounds like you have done everything right so far, in that you have gone to see your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> and they have prescribed medications. 

My strong advice would be to use the medications that your dermatologist gave you as prescribed and then follow up with her. Sometimes rashes are very hard to figure out, and the best method of attacking them is to keep talking and communicating with your dermatologist about this, as she is the expert here! 

If you have particular concerns or doubts about the effectiveness of the treatment that she has prescribed for you, then I would recommend that you set up a visit or phone call to discuss that with her directly. I am certain she will be receptive to your thoughts and will work together with you to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. "
What to put on a dry skin patch on scalp after ringworm ?,"This is a good question to discuss with your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> (if he has one). The first important thing is to make sure that the ringworm infection itself is totally cleared up, as treatment requires taking medication for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, the first thing I would do is check back in with your son's pediatrician to make sure they agree that the infection is all gone. If not, they can give you some advice about how much longer he might need to take the anti fungal medication. 

Assuming the fungus is entirely gone, then it can, unfortunately, take quite a while for the hair to grow back completely, often many months. The important thing is to allow the hair to grow back at its own pace, and to avoid brushing, combing, or otherwise irritating the area, as this might damage the newly forming hairs. If there is a significant amount of itching or dry skin, then applying a simple nonmedicated moisturizing ingredient, such as vaseline or a simple lotion, should be sufficient. 

Rest assured that, in most cases, hair recovery after a case of ringworm is complete, even if it does take a while. Good luck, and please talk to your son's <a href=""/dermatologists"">doctor</a>."
What is this in between my toes?,"Since this area with fluid inside it is so large and persistent, I would definitely have your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> take a look at it at your earliest convenience. I can think of several possible causes, and they will be able to help you figure out what is going on. 

First of all, this could just be a blister, which can occur whenever there is friction causes rubbing over an area of skin between the toes. However, blisters are usually painful, not typically itching, which suggest to me that something else might be more likely. 

Contact dermatitis, or some other allergic type reaction of the skin could lead to large, itchy blistering areas. This might be from something that you accidentally stepped in, as well as a reaction to a laundry detergent or similar substance. 

A fungal infection of the skin between the toes could also cause weeping sores and itching, typically with a significant odor. 

It is important to figure out what is going on, because the treatments are different. For example, contact dermatitis would require a topical steroid cream, whereas a fungal infection would require an anti fungal cream. 

Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can!"
Is it normal to get multiple spots of melanoma? ,"First, I would like to know if the spots you had removed were just moles (areas of pigmented cells under the skin), or if they were confirmed to be melanoma by the <a href=""/pathologists"">pathologist</a>. If the former, then having new areas of spots that you hadn't noticed before is less concerning. However if the spots that you had removed were confirmed to be melanoma, then this is very concerning and needs to be addressed right away. 

Melanoma can be a very serious form of cancer, and it has a tendency to spread throughout the body. Sometimes, it can spread to distant organs, but other times it spreads directly through the skin. If the spots you had were melanoma, than new spots near the area where the biopsy was performed could represent spreading melanoma. 

I highly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> (or whichever doctor it is that is closely following your case) right away. They will be able to determine whether these new spots you have discovered are concerning for spreading melanoma and, if so, what needs to be done next in terms of treatment. 

Go see your doctor as soon as you possibly can!"
Do O have folliculitis?,"It sounds like you might be just dealing with a bad <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a> flare. Whiteheads are one of the two common forms of acne (blackheads being the other). They are caused when the pores in the skin become clogged closed, leading to the accumulation of skin debris, bacteria, and oils (the ""white"" stuff). 

Folliculitis can also cause whitehead like formations, but folliculitis is rare on the face. It tends to occur on body areas with more course hair, like the scalp, armpits, or groin. 

I would suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> about this issue. They can take a look at your skin and confirm whether or not this is acne or something else. Based on what they see, they can recommend a treatment regimen. Treatment for acne tends to include a good daily face cleansing regimen. In addition, a topical agent called a comedonolytic may be need to strip away dead skin and keep the pores open. Comedonolytics may be over the counter or prescription strength. Finally, in the most severe cases, additional medications such as antibiotic creams or tretinoin cream may be prescribed. 

Please set up an appointment as soon as you can."
Why have I had hives for about 6 months?,"It is not clear what type of a skin rash you have and where it is located. This is where a picture is truly worth a thousand words. The location and characteristic of a rash can almost always lead to a right diagnosis and treatment. In general, irritation of the soft tissue can cause the skin to get red and inflamed that results in a skin rash. Hives, on the other hand, are usually due to an allergic type of a reaction. People call many rashes ""hives"" but in fact most of the time it is not the case. Transient skin rashes do not always warrant a visit to your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor. However, any rashes that last more than 1-2 months should have a doctor's evaluation to make sure that it is not something else like psoriasis or <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, etc. Other skin diseases can present similarly to a rash, or a patch that can be itchy. Still some systemic diseases can also present with skin lesions without local symptoms. Thus, a skin rash that persists for more than 6 weeks should be examined by a physician. He or she may opt to try a low dose topical steroid. If there is no improvement, your doctor may increase the drug level or get a skin biopsy. Good luck!"
How can I gain weight quickly and safely?,"That is an interesting situation to be in, as most Americans have the need to lose weight, either for their job or for their overall health. As you move into this new career, please make sure that any weight you gain or other health changes that you make are beneficial, and that they do not haunt you for the rest of your life. To ensure you’re proceeding in a safe and healthy manner, you should always discuss major lifestyle changes with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.

That being said, the best weight to gain, and possibly the quickest, is the weight that you can gain with muscle. Some balance of weight lifting or other strength training will provide a scaffold that the extra protein can <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> on to. With that scaffolding will also come some water, which will quickly add the weight. This is by far healthier than simply stopping at your local fast food restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In order to add extra bulk, you will need extra calories, and many will suggest that protein is a good source of healthy calories. Again, before beginning any of these changes, you should speak with your primary care doctor, who may recommend a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> or nutritionist. He or she would then be able to help you as needed. Good luck, and good work for seeking to be healthy as you do this."
"""What is the Dukan diet, and is it recommended?""","The Dukan diet originated in France but has subsequently spread around the world. Essentially, it is a high protein low carbohydrate diet not unlike the Atkins diet which is also quite popular here in the United States. 

High protein diets should not be started without clearing it first with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This is because they may be dangerous in some individuals, such as those with kidney disease or diabetes. Also, a major disadvantage of these high protein diets is that they do not necessarily teach you how to eat moderately from a wide range of diverse foods, since artificially restricting the types of foods you eat is a necessary part of their <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> strategy. This can be a problem for people who successfully lose weight with one of these diets but then have trouble keeping the weight off when they are done dieting. 

In addition to dieting, it will also be important to engage in exercise on a daily basis, since diet alone (without exercise) is much less likely to lead to successful weight loss. Your doctor can help you figure out what kinds of exercise are safe and healthy for you. 

Good luck, and congratulations for making the decision to work on this problem!"
What should nutrition be like after an embolic stroke?,"I am so sorry to hear about your father's stroke, and also hope that he does well. Nutrition is an important part of his life both in regards to recovery as well as prevention going forward. I highly recommend discussing this issue with a <a href=""/naturopathic-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;doctor, dietitian, or <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>.

Depending on where the stroke occurred and where the doctors believe the emboli came from may play into his nutritional status going forward. For example, if his stroke affected his ability to take food by mouth, this may really change the answer to this question and he may need to be fed through some other method. Alternatively, if his doctors believe that the stroke came from one of the big arteries in his neck, then adopting a healthy diet may be beneficial to stabilize and decrease the risk of further events in the future. If, however, doctors believe that his emboli came from somewhere else and surgery needs to occur to prevent future events like this in the future, then the goal may be to build up his strength as quickly as possible to prepare him for whatever surgery may be needed.

Regardless, a dietician or nutritionist will be very qualified to help you with regards to your questions. Please speak to your doctor about your concerns."
"I am iron, vitamin B and vitamin D deficient. Why?","It sounds like you have many different things that could be happening to cause you to be so deficient in so many of your vitamins and minerals. Before I say anything else, I should point out that this is something that should be discussed with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, someone who can follow up with you over a long period of time to make sure that these levels improve and that you remain healthy while they do. 
Now, many things can make a person deficient. One of the most obvious ones is decreased intake. Vitamin D is added to many of the dairy products that we use, as it is a fat-soluble vitamin that we would otherwise not get enough of in many cases. But there is something extra about vitamin d, which is the fact that our bodies can make it to a certain extent. Using sunlight, our skin can convert different molecules in our body to become the vitamin d that we need to help us with calcium regulation and many other functions. Due to the fact that your levels are so far off, I would recommend speaking with your doctor to make sure you get back on track. "
What does blood test for a swollen lymph node test or check for?,"There are many different tests that can be run for someone who has a swollen lymph node, and certainly the history surrounding the swelling is important to understand. One of the most likely tests for your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> to have ordered is a CBC, or complete blood count. This will show levels of red blood cells, platelets, and infection fighting cells in your body. This is important if you have a swollen lymph node for several reasons. First, if your level of infection fighting cells is high, this can often be a sign of an infection, which would lead your doctor to suspect that perhaps there is a smoldering infection somewhere that needs to be treated to make sure that you can get back to your usual state of health. Additionally, this same test can tell you if other parts of your blood cells, say your white blood cells (which usually fight infection, as above) or your platelets (which help with clotting) are abnormally elevated which could indicate different types of blood malignancies. There are, of course, many other tests that your doctor could order that could give more specific information depending on what he or she was thinking. Please speak with your doctor about your questions. "
Is orange mucus bad?,"I am sorry that you have to put up with such miserable symptoms, and hope that you feel better soon. The best thing to do is to speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>. While there is some literature that suggests that the color of mucous doesn't really matter, it is certainly true that colored mucous (more than just the thin runny nose that we all occasionally get) can be a sign of a bacterial or fungal infection. Obviously, that doesn't help us to know what bug is causing the infection, but it can help us to know that we should be looking for something. While the color may not help too much, the tenacity of the mucous (the rubber texture you describe) could indicate that the infection has at least some element of a fungal component. For some reason, the mucous of a fungal sinusitis does tend to be very rubbery as you describe. While there are many over the counter treatments that can help (such as nasal saline irrigation), it is likely that you should speak with your doctor so that he or she can scope your sinuses and possibly get some additional imaging or even start some treatment. Again, please speak with your doctor. "
Could the technician have infected my arm while drawing blood?,"This is certainly a concerning story for a number of reasons. Obviously, recent events in the news have led all of us to have some concerns about the sanity and sterility of the tools that practitioners use to take care of us. Unfortunately, part of the world that we are in today involves being an advocate for ourselves and speaking up if we have concerns. While it may be awkward, it is certainly appropriate for you to raise these same questions with the person drawing your blood while you are there. 
Now, to address your questions: while anything is certainly possible, the odds of transmission of an infection are very low. For the most part, it is unheard of for a physician or any healthcare worker to blatantly violate common protocol to protect patients. Additionally, even in the worst circumstances, the rates of infection are, fortunately, quite low. <a href=""/surgeons"">Surgeons</a>, who are often stuck with needles and knives while doing <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> on infected people, are fortunately only infected in these situations in a very small number of cases. If you have concerns, and it seems that you do, it would be appropriate to speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> about your concerns to see what can be done. You may also wish to speak with the ordering provider who sent you to have that blood work done in the first place so that changes can be made. "
Why do I feel pressure on my chest and my stomach?,"Chest and <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">stomach pain</a> or pressure or any other descriptive word are not always straightforward problems to diagnose. Before anything else, however, it is important to understand that these are symptoms that should be discussed with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> in person, as they can be signs of a serious emergency, such as a heart attack. This is something that can obviously depend quite a bit on other signs and symptoms, as well as your overall health, but is not something that should be taken lightly. This is especially true if you are a diabetic, have a smoking history, or have other health problems that would put you at higher risk for a heart attack. Fortunately, these symptoms are usually due to something much less serious, such as heartburn. Acid reflux disease can be described by different people in different ways, and the pressure that you describe could certainly fit into this category. Other <a href=""/procedure/digestive-problem-1452"">digestive problems</a> could explain your symptoms, and there are some lung problems that could have the same symptoms as well. The most important thing is to discuss your symptoms with your doctor to make sure that they are not something that needs to be addressed shortly. Please speak to your doctor. "
"Is there a urine, blood or saliva test to check adrenaline levels?","The short answer is yes, there is a test that can be used to measure your adrenaline levels. For some people, what is needed is a measure of these levels to make sure that they do not have abnormal secretion of this hormone from other parts of the body. Most often, what your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> may be trying to describe is the reaction of stress that is often associated with adrenaline. He or she may be saying that your stress levels are quite high and that amitryptiline would help you to deal with the stress in a productive way, and may help you to sleep better. More importantly, it would seem as though you need to be able to communicate fully with your doctor about what he or she means when they make comments about the usefulness of a medication like the one that you are describing. It is always best to be able to speak directly to your doctor if you have a question. The internet can then provide invaluable information to fill in the gaps. Please speak with your doctor about your questions and whether or not further testing is appropriate for you. "
Black out and dizziness when standing or sitting. Low blood pressure?,"Based on your symptoms and complaints, you should see a <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;doctor, perhaps the same doctor who had treated you previously and can determine if these symptoms are similar to what you had before or if they are new or concerning. Given that it has been a few years and these symptoms are at least partly new (the migraines and the fact that your conservative methods of treating this don't seem to help), I would not feel comfortable recommending any treatment over the Internet without having met you first. While it can be difficult without money to see a doctor, there are times when it might be worth doing, and this appears to be one of those times. Most hospitals and doctors will have a way for those without funds to see a physician, and many cities will have a free clinic with volunteers that can help. From what you have said, it sounds like you have already tried some of the simple remedies for low blood pressure, such as increasing electrolytes and fluid consumption. If these have not worked, blood sugar could be another likely cause. Please speak with a doctor, and work with them to find a way to get the care you need."
Nits or dandruff?,"This can be a difficult thing to determine for many people, and it may be necessary to have a professional evaluate your hair to be sure. Often, lice will have some itching associated with it, although this may take some time and you may be in the minority of people who tolerate this quite well. You have mentioned some of the cardinal signs of lice, regarding finding the white beads that can form on the hair shafts and have to be removed from the hair with the fingertips. Often, if you have known exposure to someone who has lice it can be more likely that you have lice. Like most things in medicine, it is hardly ever a sure bet and so <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctors</a> will often determine the likelihood based on your story, your contacts, your symptoms, and your examination. While you can provide most of that over the Internet, it is obviously important to see a professional if you are concerned. Some beauty salons would be able to help you with this, but you should obviously speak with a health professional (read, your doctor) if you are still having symptoms, additional complaints, or have any other reason to be concerned. "
Why am I bleeding so much this month with no clots?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having additional <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> this month, and hope that this is just a brief deviation from your norm. If you regularly have heavy periods with large clots, speaking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> is important to make sure that you are not anemic, that you don't have a bleeding problem, and that your uterus is normal and healthy. There are multiple things that can cause continued bleeding, and it would be important to have them evaluated. If you have recently changed your medications or diet, there are some obvious things that can thin your blood and make this bleeding more likely. While aspirin is an obvious example, even simple things like ibuprofen can thin your blood to some degree by preventing clotting. If you feel that your bleeding is abnormal or if this is still continuing, please speak with your doctor about your problem so that you can make sure that you are well and can be tested if this is necessary. "
Is it normal for an open post-surgery wound to weep clear liquid a little bit?,"From what you are describing, this could be entirely normal. Unfortunately, I do not know the specifics of your surgery, however, and only your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> would be able to answer completely whether or not you are having a postoperative complication. In general, most wounds will have some drainage of a clear, pink fluid after they are created. This fluid is high in concentrations of the molecules and cells that your body uses to fight infection and heal the wound. Over time, this leaking fluid will seal off the wounded blood vessels and will stop. This fluid is usually known as sero-sanguinous fluid, and is quite common. Signs of something more serious usually include pus, or discolored fluid. If the wound becomes more red, or has more pain or changes in other manners, that would be a sign of an infection. Speaking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> is also important if you have a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, which could be another sign. Again, to answer your question most perfectly, please speak to your surgeon about your concerns to make sure that you are healing appropriately. He or she may want you to use a dressing or take special steps to wash the wound to keep it healthy. "
Can cold sore virus spread from chapstick?,"This is an excellent question, as you are very much correct that the viruses responsible for cold sores can be very, very contagious.  In general, if your girlfriend was only exposed to your chapstick after the cold sore scabbed over, then it is less likely that you were actively shedding virus at the time and thus she is much less likely to pick up this infection.  However, it is certainly still possible and she should discuss this with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  In general, it is best not to share chapsticks for exactly these reasons.

If you or your girlfriend have any questions, your primary care physician will be able to discuss this in more detail.  In particular, it may be important to know whether what you are describing as a cold sore is actually an outbreak of the herpes virus HSV-1 or HSV-2.  These highly contagious viruses can also cause significant discomfort if they infect skin in the genital area.  For people who develop multiple recurrent episodes of either oral or genital HSV, suppressive antiviral medications such as acyclovir may be effective in preventing the frequency and severity of outbreaks.  Your physician can help you determine whether this might be an issue for you.  Hopefully the cold sore you have will be completely gone in no time!"
Why do lips patch together when you close them for a while?,"You are correct that sometimes changes in your skin, specifically dehydration, can cause your lips to stick together.  This simply reflects the decrease in moisture in the skin during dry times.  Your lips are naturally moistened by your oral mucosa, and if your keep your lips pressed together, you may not get adequate moisture.  

If you have concerns about changes in your skin, the best thing to do is speak with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can evaluate your skin and recommend moisturizers as needed.  It is important to take care of your skin, and skin on the face is particularly vulnerable to sun damage or age damage.  In addition, if it looks like you have any areas of skin concerning for malignancy such as melanoma or basal cell carcinoma, your physician can refer you to a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> for a more thorough skin exam and biopsy as needed.  Depending upon your age, skin type, and sun exposure, it might be important for you to undergo annual screening exams to make sure that you don't develop any skin cancers.  In any case, it is always important to wear sunscreen on your face, and it may be helpful to use a lip moisturizer that also includes sunscreen. Again, please talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> if you have concerns about changes in your skin."
I've read that Benadryl can both raise and lower blood pressure - which is correct?,"Benadryl is a medication that works by blocking the action of histamine, the mediator of common allergic reactions such as sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose.  Benadryl itself is not a medication that directly acts to change blood pressure, but because of its potential effects on the vasculature and interactions with other drugs, it is recommended that this medication be taken with caution by those who have a diagnosis of hypertension and/or are on hypertension mediations.  

The best thing for you to do to protect your health is to discuss your use of Benadryl as a sleep aid (not uncommon, as this is the active ingredient in Tylenol pm) with your physician.  He or she will be able to go over your health history and current medications to make sure that Benadryl is something that is safe for you to take.  Unless you have wildly uncontrolled hypertension and are on many different medications, it is probably a perfectly safe medication to consider. However, it is always best to go over any prescription or over the counter medications with your physician and possibly your pharmacist to make sure there are not any concerning reactions or side effects that you should know about."
Can a doctor know if I had sex or not if my hymen is broken ?,"This is a very common question that is asked of doctors, and the short answer is that it is not always possible to tell. As you suggest, there may be some signs that would indicate that a person has had intercourse, but these signs could be from other things or could be incomplete, making the answer somewhat less obvious. In general, a close relationship with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> would be important to make sure that you are as healthy as you can be. He or she would be able to help you with different tests and recommendations based on what you tell him or her. While it may be tempting to avoid answering the question about having had sex, it is something to consider. Please be honest with your doctor, as this will be important to keeping you healthy. You should also consider all of the ramifications of not telling your parents the whole truth about having had sex. In some cases, you might be surprised at the extra support your parents may be able to offer. Regardless, you can know that what you share with your doctor is confidential within certain boundaries. Please speak fully and truthfully with your doctor. "
"Should the following be included in the category of fluid: Milk (whole or skim), Yogurt, Soup?","It sounds like you are doing an excellent job of trying to comply with your physician's recommendations when it comes to important changes in your diet.  This can be very difficult, but following your physician's recommendations can definitely make a difference in your overall health so it is important that you continue to do your best to make these changes.  In general, milk of any kind and broth-based soups are counted towards a patient's total fluid intake for the day.  Soup that is not a broth-base (a chili or chowder) is often not counted.  Yogurt would not count towards a fluid intake.

If you have any questions about how to make these changes in your diet, you should feel free to discuss this further with your physician.  He or she may also be able to refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> which might be a helpful step for you to continue to make adjustments in your diet.  If you have a history of osteoporosis, it will be important to make sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin D in your diet, and since milk and dairy products can be an important source of these nutrients, you want to make sure that you continue to adjust your diet in the right way by discussing it with a medical professional."
Do almonds cause acne?,"It sounds like you are concerned about <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a>, and you are very much correct that in some people, specific foods can play a role in triggering an outbreak.  However it is important to remember that foods which can cause a problem in one patient may not cause a problem for another.  If you are worried that almonds (or any other kind of tree nut) is causing an acne problem for you, you should discuss with your physician the possibility of eliminating these foods from your diet and keeping a log about your acne symptoms.  This will help you determine whether almonds are a problem for you.

In addition, if you have concerns about treating acne or about the role of certain foods in contributing to acne, you can always discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> who can refer you to a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> if needed.  There are many good pharmaceutical options to treat acne, depending upon its type and location on the body.  There is no reason you should suffer from this kind of skin problem, as medical options do exist to treat it effectively.  In addition to diet, your physician can help prescribe a combination of topical or oral agents to help get this under control."
"What could a lump on the left (lower-side) of my abdomen, under left rib cage be?","I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from multiple health issues, and hope that these will improve. I am certainly happy that you will be speaking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> shortly about this bump, as bumps should always be promptly reviewed with your physician unless they have a known cause and resolve shortly (like hitting your head on a cupboard!). As for what this lump could be, you certainly seem to be describing something that is in the most superficial layers of the skin. In most cases, these are not signs of a deeper problem, but are rather local reactions to something that is happening, such as a local skin infection. Unfortunately, without more information about your overall health and without the ability to see the lump and characterize it better (pain, recent <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, etc), it is difficult to anticipate exactly what this might be. As you suggested that you will be seeing your doctor shortly, it may be appropriate to observe this spot carefully for signs of change so that you can describe it fully to your doctor when you visit. Please follow up with your doctor as planned, or sooner if you become more concerned. "
Do paratoid glands ever reduce swelling after bulimia has stopped?,"It sounds like you have had some significant health challenges in the past.  It is a very positive step that you are able to take these proactive steps for yourself and work to deal with bulimia and the side effects this disease can have on the rest of your health.  Swelling in the lymph nodes and salivary glands in the face/neck area is definitely one of the side effects of continual binging and purging associated with bulimia.  How and when this kind of swelling resolves depends on the individual patient and how longstanding her <a href=""/procedure/eating-disorder-180"">eating disorder</a> was, which is why you should continue to discuss the case with your physician.  It is possible that gland hypertrophy in an individual patient may not completely resolve, but this is a very individual issue and would need to be assessed by the physicians treating formerly bulimic patients.  In many patients, when the cycle of binging and purging stops, the tissues which are damaged during this process--including the salivary glands--can slowly go back to normal.  This sounds like what you were taught in treatment centers.  However, it is always possible that the damage to a particular salivary gland is significant enough that it may take a long time to resolve.  Hopefully this is not the case for you, and if you have concerns about this you should continue to discuss them with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and any other medical professionals involved in your treatment center."
Repeated big toe infections - what should I do?,"It sounds like you have quite a challenging issue!  You are doing all the right things by continuing to seek medical attention when you know you have something wrong.  Recurrent infections can be difficult, and it sounds like you have some compounding underlying issues that make your situation even more challenging.  There are several things you can do in this situation.  First, you can get a second opinion from another <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a>, as there may be some other issues related to foot care or nail care that might help you keep these infections at bay.  If you have significant psoriasis on your toes/feet then you should definitely continue working with a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> to address this.  It is not uncommon for people with psoriasis to have lesions in places that are difficult to treat (the feet, face etc).  There should definitely be some options that a dermatologist can discuss with you.  Psoriasis is treatable, even when it is sometimes a challenge.  If your current dermatologist is not able to offer you anything else, it may be that you need to seek a second opinion there as well.  Finally, you can also discuss with your GP about whether or not seeing an <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a> might be helpful.  Good luck!"
Regarding gray hair,"This is an excellent question and it is good that you are thinking through the fact that supplements, even though they come without a prescription, can definitely sometimes have adverse effects on your health!  In your case, since you don't have any significant problems, it sounds like you are probably not on any standing medications.  Often, supplements can cause problems when they interact with other prescription medications a person might be taking.  Overall, if you are thinking of starting a new over the counter supplement, the best thing to do is to talk this over with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she should be able to reassure you whether or not the supplement is a good idea.  And, it can be very helpful if you know which brand of supplement you were thinking of using so you can discuss that specific product with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>.  You can bring the labels from the products you are considering to an appointment to discuss further.

With regard to your specific concerns about grey hair, unfortunately there is no good scientific evidence that supplements of any kind affect the production of gray hair.  You can discuss this further with your physician, but you might be better off considering highlights or dye to mask the gray."
"What is the dime sized, burning bump in my underarm??","While I'm not exactly sure what it is that you are describing (it would be important to look at it to know for sure), I can tell you that it is important to have this be seen by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>. Any wound that has been present for some time and is leaking pus is important to have evaluated. As you well know, there are many bacteria present that can be resistant to common antibiotics, and the best way to treat and avoid these is to fix any problems like what you are describing before they become worse. It is possible, from the description you provide, that you have had a small skin infection that has developed into an <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a>. While this is something that can be readily treated in the early stages, it can go on to become something quite serious if it is not monitored and managed appropriately. Early antibiotics, and perhaps drainage, can make a world of difference down the line. Of course there are other things that can cause similar symptoms as well, and your doctor would be able to help determine if anything more complicated is happening. Please speak with your doctor about this bump."
"I have small, tiny, white or yellow bumps on my upper lip. What is it?","There are many things that can cause bumps on your lips, and it is appropriate for you to be concerned until you find out what it may be. There is quite a bit more information that is needed before I can fully answer your question, however, and the best thing to do is to see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>. First, I would need to know when they showed up, what they look like, and what has changed that might have caused them (allergies, sexual habits, new exposures, recent illness--things like that). I would also need to know your health history and what medications you are on. With no more information than what you have provided, it is possible that this is either a viral demonstration (if you have felt run down or ill of late, this might strengthen that hypothesis), or a bacterial problem. An allergic reaction could also be a possibility, although there are some people that will have yellow bumps on the inside of their mouth from other things. The best thing to do is to have them examined by a doctor so that he or she can ask all of these questions and actually look at the spots. Hopefully, they are simply something temporary. Please speak with your doctor. "
"What could be causing prolonged nausea, fatigue and loss of appetite?","It sounds like you have had a significant and rather dramatic change in your health with this new constellation of symptoms.  There are many different things that could be causing your symptoms, and in this situation you should definitely see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> as soon as possible (an urgent care visit if necessary).  It will be important for your physician to hear all the details of your story, examine you, consider your prior health history, and then likely check some basic laboratory tests to begin to identify what might be causing your symptoms.  

Among other things, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> with fevers and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> can be caused by a problem with the stomach, liver, or gallbladder.  Given that your symptoms have persisted for more than a few days and you are noticing some changes in your urine, it is possible that your liver is not functioning properly and some of the chemicals it normally excretes (bilirubin) are causing some changes in your urine.  A problem with your liver can be excluded by checking your labs.  In addition, if you have not been able to keep food or fluids down, you may also have some electrolyte abnormalities that are contributing to your symptoms.

Hopefully you'll be feeling better soon, but to protect your health it is important to see your physician as soon as possible!"
"Why am I tired, in pain, and have disturbed digestive functioning?","It sounds like you have been having a number of concerning symptoms recently.  It is also a good thing that you have been seeking medical attention for these new and worrisome findings, since that is always the best thing to do when there is a change in your health.  From the symptoms you describe, it sounds like there could be many different things that account for your symptoms.  In this case, your health background, family history, and current medications will be very helpful. The best thing for you to do as you try to work through these symptoms is to continue to see your physician for a thorough physical exam and review of your history to help guide future testing.

Some of your digestive symptoms could be consistent with something like celiac disease, in which your body reacts to gluten in the diet.  The only way to conclusively determine if this is the case is for you to undergo evaluation with an endoscopy of your small bowel.  However, whether this is truly indicated in your situation or not will require further discussion with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>.   Hopefully you will be feeling back to your old self before long, and in the meantime, it is also a very good thing that you are practicing safe sex."
How do I get rid of inner lower back pain?,"It sounds like you are having some very bothersome symptoms!  Sine the pain is still there, and even moving around in location despite use of medication, at this point the best thing to do is go back to your physician for further discussion and evaluation.  It is quite possible that you do simply have a <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a> or imbalance, but given the extent of your symptoms it may well require physical therapy to strengthen and get back to normal.  However, it is also possible that you are  suffering from some other sort of medical problem, as other things can cause pain in the lower back or flank.  A kidney stone, kidney infection, irritation of the large bowel, <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a>, or even a testicular problem could cause pain in this area.  In order to determine what might be causing your symptoms now, it will be important for your physician to take a thorough history of the pain you have been having recently, as well as any other health problems you have.  A complete physical exam will also be very helpful to make sure that this does still seem like a musculoskeletal problem and not a symptom of something else.  Hopefully you will be feeling better soon!"
Why does TB (Tuberculosis) occur in the intestine?,"That is a great question to discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. Tuberculosis is a infection that is spread from person to person through coughing and other types of exposures.  It typically affects the lungs, but can affect almost any organ in the body.  The infection can start in the lungs and if it goes untreated for many years, can move to other parts of the body.  The intestine is one of those places.

The good news is that tuberculosis of any form is incredibly rare in the United States.  People that are susceptible to getting TB are those that have traveled to certain parts of east Asia, Africa, and South America, or have spent time homeless or in prison.  If this does not describe you, then the chances that you have been exposed to TB is incredibly low.  Even if you feel that you have been exposed to TB, the likelihood that this occurred in the US and went undetected for the years that it would take to become an intestinal infection is very low.  Diet is not a factor in determining where TB spreads. 

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.  If you feel that you may have been exposed to TB, then you can have a PPD test, which can rule out TB exposure.  "
What should I do about my staph infection?,"It sounds like you have a soft tissue infection, which you should discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. These are usually caused by bacteria that live on the skin.  Staph is one of those bacteria.  From a physicians point of view, staph comes in a few different types depending on what type of antibiotic works against it.  One type that you may have heard of is MRSA (stands for methicillin resistant staph aureus).  Whenever you treat a soft tissue infection, you have to make sure that MRSA is covered.  That is why your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> put you on bactrim pills.  Bactrim covers community acquired MRSA.  

The real question here is whether or not you have an <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a>.  Staph is known to cause abscess and when it does, the antibiotics alone will not cure the infection.  The abscess must be drained.  This is what your mom tried to do when she lanced it.  If an abscess is there and no puss or fluid came out, then you will likely need to have it lanced again by a physician.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician.  He or she can again look at the infection and determine if an abscess is present.  If there is one, then it needs to be drained.  If there isn't one, then your infection should get better with antibiotics.  "
Does lower sperm count cause body growth to stop?,"It sounds like you have several questions about your health.  Whenever you notice changes in your body or your health, or if you have questions about whether certain activities could be affecting you, the best thing to do is to speak with your physician about your concerns.  Your growth and development during puberty is not affected by masturbation, and sperm count is not indicative of whether you are growing and developing in a healthy way.  However, if you have concerns about this or questions about whether what you are experiencing is normal or not, your physician should be able to help answer these questions in a confidential way.  In addition, if you have questions or concerns about sexuality and safe sexual practices, your physician can also be a very good source of medically accurate and of course confidential information.  It is a good thing that you are paying attention to your health and trying to make sure that you are staying safe and well.  It is also important to make sure that you let a physician know if you notice things that concern you about possible changes in your health.  Hopefully you can rest assured that your health is just fine after speaking with your physician."
Help! I pulled my groin!,"It sounds like this is a very frustrating situation for you.  A pulled muscle in the groin can definitely cause significant discomfort, including pain that sometimes radiates into the testicle.  However, the symptoms you are reporting could also be related to other conditions including a possible <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a> or even a primary testicular mass.  In order to get to the bottom of what is causing your symptoms it will be helpful for you to see a physician for a thorough history and exam. You don't mention how long it has been since you feel that you injured your groin and this could be significant (as well as the details of how this occurred).  You <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> will want to know about any other changes in your health you have noticed recently, as well as your general medical history.  A physical examination will also be very helpful to identify if there are any discrete masses in your testicle or evidence of an inguinal hernia (where a loop of bowel can slide past some of the ligaments in the groin and herniate into the testicle).  Hopefully you will be feeling back to your normal self soon, but it is important to follow up with your physician to make sure there is nothing more serious going on."
What caused my POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)and other symptoms?,"You have a very extensive medical history, and should continue to follow up with your physicians. As you know, POTS is a relatively rare syndrome, and it is not clear exactly what causes it.  There is likely a genetic component as well as possible contributors from environmental exposures, including certain infections before the condition was diagnosed.

As for your other symptoms, again, there are multiple possible explanations here.  The lightheadedness and forgetfulness can be very typical of POTS.  In addition, the chest pain and <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> could very well be related to the GERD.  GERD is a common cause of chest pain, particularly if it is a new diagnosis and you have not been on controlling medications until recently.  In addition, if you have been suffering all of these unpleasant symptoms recently, you may have significantly cut down on your food intake without having even realized it.  The autonomic dysfunction associated with POTS can also cause <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> as well muscle weakness and fatigue.  If you have been having poor oral intake or even <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, this could also contribute to electrolyte disturbances which are causing some of your other symptoms.  POTS is also associated with fibromyalgia which could also account for some of your symptoms.

Given the multifactorial nature of your complaints and the recent diagnoses, the best thing for you to do is to continue to follow through with your physicians and recommended medical treatment. Hopefully as your symptoms are controlled you will start to feel better soon!"
What are these two soft bumps on my thumbs(fingerprint area)?,"The best thing to do is to discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. It is definitely possible that extensive use of a device with a touchpad, such as an iIpad, could lead to some benign soft tissue accumulation (such as a callus) on your fingers.  This would be even more likely if you are left-handed and thus likely to use your left thumb more than the right.  However, it is also possible that these bumps you describe have nothing to do with your Ipad use.  Plantar's <a href=""/procedure/wart-s-191"">warts</a> on the hands and feet can present as soft bumps that don't go away on their own.  Benign growths such as lymphomas or even a cyst can also present as persistent bumps.  In this case, the best thing to do is make an appointment to see your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation.  It is quite likely that a physician can identify these bumps simply by looking at them, but it will be important to go over your health history as well, just to make sure that there haven't been any additional changes in your health that could suggest these bumps are part of something more systemic.  Depending upon the results of your exam, it may also be possible to have these bumps removed, if they are bothering you significantly."
Should I be worried about my kidneys if my mother and grandmother had polycystic kidney disease?,"It sounds like you have had some changes or concerning findings with your health recently, in addition to the family history of polycystic kidney disease.  There are several reasons why the best thing for you to do right now is to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> (or set up an appointment with a new one, if you don't have one) so that you can go over both your family history as well as your current symptoms to take the best care of your health.  Polycystic kidney disease can be inherited in what is called an autosomal dominant fashion, which means any child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of being affected by the disease.  Given that your mother had the <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> and you have a known cyst in your kidney, it will be important to screen you for the disease so that you can be treated and followed by a <a href=""/nephrologists"">nephrologist</a> so that you don't develop renal failure unexpectedly.  In addition, patients with PKD are also prone to other adverse health issues, so it will be important to discuss screening options with your physician.  Secondly, if you are having skin changes, particularly color changes, it will be important to be evaluated by your physician so you can undergo a thorough physical exam and possibly some laboratory testing.  Overall this is the best way to protect your health!"
Why do I have abdomen pain?,"Since you have been having pains now in your abdomen for a full week, it would be a good idea to be evaluated by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>. 

There are very serious causes of abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, as you have pointed out. The fact that you mostly feel ok, without severe pain, vomiting, pain with running, etc is a very good sign, which makes a serious cause of your pain less likely. However, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will be able to definitively make this determination for you with an interview and a physical examination. 

In addition, they will be able to investigate other potential causes of your pain. Some of the more common causes of abdominal pain like you what you are describing include excess intestinal gas and bloating, constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome. Occasionally gallstones may also present this way, particularly with the pain under your right shoulder and under your ribs. 

After examining you, your doctor may want to get some other studies, such as basic blood work or an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the abdomen to help them narrow down the potential causes of your pain. Based on what they find, they'll be able to help you decided whether any specific treatment is needed. Book an appointment today."
Should I be concerned about my unsteady heartbeat if I'm on Adderall?,"This is a very good question, and it sounds like you've been thinking through your symptoms very carefully.  You are absolutely correct that you should see a physician about this right away, and the best person to start with would be your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care physician or the person who is writing you the adderall prescription.  He or she will want to ask you more questions about your symptoms, likely obtain an EKG, and go over a thorough physical exam.  Your age and other health issues will also be very relevant for helping to determine whether this is just a side effect of the medication or whether additional testing is needed.  If any abnormalities are noted on your exam or EKG, then your physician may well want to refer you to a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> for further evaluation.  If it does seems like other causes are not involved, then your doctor may want to decrease your dose of adderall or even stop it entirely.  This will be a discussion for you and your physician after you have more information.  However, for right now you should be evaluated right away, hopefully in an urgent care setting at your doctor's office.  You should ask your doctor whether you should keep taking the medication or stop it now."
What do you think of the pure green coffee bean extract for weight loss?,"Trying to develop a medically sound strategy for <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> can be a challenge.  It is definitely important to try to maintain a healthy body weight, as this can help maximize your quality of life and decrease your chance of developing one of many poor health outcomes that can be linked to being overweight or obese (including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>).  However, there is no sound scientific evidence to support the use of green coffee bean extract (or any of the other extracts, supplements, or other remedies often touted on the internet) for supporting and maintaining healthy weight loss.  In order to lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than you expend.  The difference in net energy expenditure results in weight loss.  You can increase the calories you expend by exercise or increasing your basal metabolic rate, and you can decrease the calories you take in my adjusting your diet.  However, a specific dietary supplement will not likely result in dramatic weight loss and can have adverse effects on your health.  If you are interested in a healthy plan to lose weight, the best thing to do is meet with your physician to discuss further.  He or she can help you outline a medically sound diet/exercise plan and potentially refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> for additional advice. Book an appointment today!"
"I have Hepatitis C and Degenerative Disc Disease - is it safe to take Oxycodone, Oxycontin, LYRICA and Duexis?","From your medication list it sounds like you have several active medical issues.  As you know, oxycodone and oxycontin are both opioid narcotic medications used to treat pain.  Lyrica is a medication that can be used to treat neuropathic pain, such as that caused by a bulging disc exerting pressure on a nerve root in the back.  Duexis is a actually a combination of two different medications, ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory used to treat pain) and famotidine (a medication that helps protect the lining of the stomach from the irritating effects of the ibuprofen).  

In order to best assess your health needs and whether or not your medications are the best choice for treating your medical conditions, the best thing for you to do is to meet with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and go over your concerns.  In very general terms, a patient with hepatitis C and some cirrhosis can take the medications you listed.  However, your health history and other lab results may well suggest specific reasons why some of these medications might not be a good choice for you.  In addition, the dose of some of your medications might need to be adjusted depending upon your liver function labs.  For this reason, it is definitely a good idea for you to meet with your primary care physician right away to go over your symptoms, health history, and medications."
"What are some possible reasons for pain under my diaphragm, intermittent fever &amp; back pain?","Your symptoms are very concerning for a serious infection in your abdomen.  A patient who has recently had abdominal surgery, even if a minor procedure, with new onset fever, chills, and <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> should be evaluated in the emergency department immediately.  It is possible that you have developed an abscess somewhere in your abdomen as a consequence of your surgery.  You will need an urgent physical examination including evaluation by a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, stat laboratory tests to determine if you have markers of infection, quite possibly some kind of abdominal imaging (<a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> or CT scan) to evaluate for possible abscess or infection, and then likely a course of intravenous antibiotics.

Hopefully you do not have a serious infection, but it is impossible to tell without completing a thorough history, physical examination, and evaluation of your labs.  If you do have an infection in your abdomen it will be important to treat it right away, either through observation with antibiotics or possibly through removing the source of infection through a surgical or interventional radiology procedure.  The sooner this evaluation can be performed, the more likely you will have a good outcome from the procedure and get back to your regular good health.  You should seek care at an emergency room right away."
What kind of attack am I having?,"It sounds like you are experiencing some very, very unpleasant and concerning symptoms.  You should seek care with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away to discuss these symptoms and appropriate evaluation.  If you start having another of these episodes, you should call an ambulance for evaluation in the emergency department immediately.  

It is impossible to say exactly what is causing these symptoms without completing a full history and examination and obtaining specific lab tests, but depending upon your age and other health issues, your symptoms could be consistent with a lack of blood flow to the brain, an event sometimes referred to as a TIA or transient ischemic attack.  A TIA is often thought to be a precursor to a stroke, so it is important to identify this immediately to make sure that your don't suffer any further health problems.  Some of the symptoms you describe could also be from a heart problem, specifically a problem with the conduction system in your heart.  If your heart is beating too slowly, then you could experience the symptoms you describe.  In patients with this kind a problem, a pacemaker can be required.

Overall, there are many conditions that could be causing your symptoms, and it is very important that you be evaluated immediately to ensure that you don't have a bad outcome with the next 'attack.' See a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a> immediately.

Why do I get red spots on both knees during a shower?,"As with any change in your health, the best thing to do when you notice something new and disturbing is to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss further.  In this case, your physician will likely want to ask you some questions about whether you have ever noticed red spots like this before; how long you have been noticing these symptoms with a shower; whether there is any pain or itching associated with the spots.  It will also be important to discuss your past health history and current medications, as these two things can often both help suggest what might be causing a new symptoms.  Of course your physician will also want to perform a physical exam to see if he or she notices anything specific about your knees or skin to help suggest what might be causing your symptoms.

Overall, it sounds as though the hot water might be causing a localized irritation of your skin.  This does not sound serious, especially if the only place that you are noticing this is near your knees.  However, before determining that this is not a big deal, you should go over your symptoms with a physician so that he or she can put this new symptom in the context of your overall health to make sure you don't need any further evaluation or treatment.

What is causing my throat to be sore for over a year?,"It sounds like you have been experiencing significantly bothersome symptoms and have had a very thorough evaluation.  It's a good thing that you have been seen by several specialists and had some imaging and scope evaluations performed--with long-standing symptoms like this, it is important to rule out things like infection, cancer, or heartburn.  In determining your next step, you have a few options.  First of all, when seeing multiple specialists as you have, it is helpful to have one main physician, often your PCP, who helps you sort through the specialist recommendations.  In this setting, it would likely be very helpful to sit down with whomever you identify as your 'main <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">doctor</a>' and go over your test results and the reports from the various imaging studies, scopes, and consultation visits.  In the end, complicated presentations such as yours often end up with the patient and his/her physician(s) having to make the best decision for that patient, without knowing 100% how things will develop from there.  It sounds like whether or not to have the tonsillectomy is the big decision you are currently facing, and unfortunately there's no way to guarantee whether that will help.  In the end, you will need to weigh the recommendations and try to make the best decision.  It will be very helpful to go over the risks and benefits with the physician who knows you the best.

How can I reduce bone pain related to CML?,"Sorry to hear that you are having so much discomfort from your condition! I would strongly recommend that you talk with your cancer <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> (<a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>) about this issue to see what can be done. 

Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a common type of blood cancer in older individuals, and it is often treated with oral medications that are often quite effective. Generally, people with CML can often live active and enjoyable lives. 

However, sometimes side effects either from the CML or from the medications used to treat the CML can be a problem. In your case, bone pain could be caused by the CML; it also is a known side effect of many of the medications at are used to treat CML. 

Talking with your oncologist would be the place to start, as they know your case best. In some cases, if the pain is deemed to be a side effect of your medication, this may require adjusting your medication dose. Alternatively, solving the problem may be as simple as adding a different medication that you can take when you have periods of bone pain. 

Contact your doctor's office for advice today, and I hope that you are feeling better soon."
Can constant low hemoglobin levels for years have long term effects?,"This is an issue that I would definitely recommend talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> about. <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">Anemia</a> is generally a symptom of another condition. For example, it could be caused by blood loss, or by poor nutrition, or by limited stores of iron in the body. All of these different forms of anemia, if significant enough, can cause symptoms such as fatigue, low energy levels, shortness of breath, dizziness, etc. 

The treatment for anemia is different, depending on what the exact cause is. For example, if you have a chronic source of bleeding, then finding and stopping it might be the answer. If you have low iron levels, then taking an iron supplement or increasing the amount of iron in your diet might be the answer. 

Therefore, the first step is talking with your doctor directly about the issue. They will be able to help you decide what testing (blood tests, for example) might be needed to help identify the cause of your anemia. Once the cause is identified, they can also help you decide what the most appropriate treatment will be. 

Start by contacting your doctor as soon as you can. I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Why is my iron so low?,"Whenever you go to a center to donate blood, they take a small drop of blood usually from a fingertip and perform a quick screening test for <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>. This test is not very accurate, but it is designed to keep people who have low blood counts from donating blood (since removing blood from the body will drop the counts even lower). 

What you should do, therefore, is go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and tell them about this experience. They will be able to perform formal blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of anemia and also to help figure out exactly why you have anemia. Anemia can be caused by different things, including low levels of iron or other essential nutrients like vitamin B12, and the blood tests your doctor will perform will help distinguish between these causes (and therefore point towards the correct treatment). 

I think the fact that you are not having periods may also need to be investigated, unless you are of the age where menopause is the most likely explanation. So make sure to mention this issue to your doctor as well.

Good luck!"
Why am I still bleeding when my period was supposed to end 3 weeks ago?,"I think your intuition that this is something you need to see your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> about is exactly correct. Any major change in your menstrual cycle or any new <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> pattern should definitely be investigated to see what is going on. Any <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should be able to help you out, so I would look for one of those as soon as possible!

A couple thoughts do occur to me. First, I wonder if you are using birth control pills. If so, break through bleeding (which is bleeding that occurs in the middle of the cycle) is pretty common, and it can start to happen even if you have previously been taking the pills for a while. Sometimes this requires switching to a different birth control method. 

Second, are you taking any seizure medications? Sometimes, certain seizure medications can produce  a serious complication in which they suppress the bone marrow. When this occurs, the levels of platelets in the blood drops, and easy bleeding can result. This is a really serious problem that needs to be diagnosed and managed immediately. 

Next, you will need complete pelvic examination, looking for any evidence of fibroids, infections, or ulcers on the cervix, all of which could cause persistent bleeding. 

Find a doctor as soon as possible so that you can get this taken care of. If you can't find a doctor quickly, go to an emergency room for evaluation, at least to rule out the possibility of a problem with your platelet levels. "
I have large bruises on my thighs,"I would definitely go back to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this as soon as possible. Unexplained bruising is always a symptom that should be investigated carefully to make sure there is nothing serious going on. 

Some of the most common causes of unexplained bruising include problems with the blood clotting system or a drop in the platelet count. These can come on suddenly, even if you were previously health and had normal blood work in the past. Your doctor will probably want to repeat the blood work. 

Itching and bruising together can, sometimes, be a sign of a serious problem with the liver. When you go to see your doctor make sure to mention if you have recently taken any new medications, or if you have any other symptoms such as yellowing of the skin or eyes, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, or changes in the color of your urine or bowel movements. 

Finally, itching with bruising may be a sign of a local skin reaction. For example, a bad case of <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a> may sometimes result in a color change in the skin that resembles a large bruise. 

Regardless of what might be going on, the first step is to see your doctor!"
"Why do I break out when taking Anastrazole, Evista and Exemestane?","Actually, what you are experience is very common. All three of these drugs have a known side effect of causing rash. Rash probably occurs in 5-10% of all people who take these drugs. 

Nevertheless, you should talk to your <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctor</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about the issue if you haven't already. One of the major decisions that needs to be made when dealing with side effects from cancer drugs is make sure that the side effects are tolerable and don't cause more problems than the desired beneficial effects of the drugs. Your doctor can examine the rash and talk to you about how it feels. Together, you can decide whether the benefits of the medication outweigh the side effects you are experiencing. 

Also, it is important to make sure the that rash you have is not a serious allergic reaction to the drug, which would be different from just a simple rash. If you are having any swelling of the face, eyes, or mouth, or if you have any trouble breathing, these would be signs of a more serious reaction which would require immediate discontinuation of the drug and immediate evaluation by an emergency room doctor. Again, please speak with your doctor soon."
Am I anemic or borderline?,"This is a question you should discuss with your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a>. <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">Anemia</a> refers to a low red blood cell count. Red blood cells are the cells responsible for picking up oxygen in the lungs and transporting this oxygen to the body's tissues. The substance within the blood cells responsible for carrying the oxygen contains iron, and as such, a low iron level is a very common cause of anemia. However, there are many different causes of anemia, including chronic disease, low vitamin B12 and low folic acid levels, to name a few. 

Many patients encountered in the primary care setting are diagnosed with either frank anemia or a borderline red cell count. To help determine the cause of your anemia, your doctor can look at characteristics of your red cells, including their shape, size and variability on a blood smear. Iron levels themselves can also be measured to confirm the diagnosis. 

Depending on the degree of your anemia, if it is caused by iron deficiency, the treatment may include supplementation with iron pills multiple times per day, and may take months to see a significant improvement. Please talk to your doctor about your symptoms soon."
Does your red blood cell count rise as you age?,"You are definitely correct that your blood counts are a bit on the high side for your age. Actually, blood counts tend to fall a bit in older adults, not rise. So this is definitely a bit abnormal. 

There are several different possible causes for having an elevated red blood cell count in someone your age, and you should definitely discuss these results with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to see if any additional workup needs to be done. 

Sometimes, if a blood draw occurs on a day that you are sick, the counts can be elevated because you may be somewhat dehydrated. In this case, usually the only thing that is needed is to repeat the counts when you are feeling better to make sure that they are lower. 

In terms of medical causes of a high red blood cell count, the most common causes are those which stimulate increased red blood cell production, usually because of chronically low oxygen levels in the blood. For example, older adults with lung or heart disease, who typically have low oxygen levels, will tend to have higher red blood cell counts. Also, there is a condition called polycythemia vera, which is a bone marrow disease, which can result in high blood counts. 

Talk to your doctor about these lab findings and about what you should do!"
"If I test negative at seven weeks, are the odds good that I'm HIV-negative?","I am glad to hear that your HIV test was negative seven weeks after the potential exposure you are worried about. The way that these HIV tests usually work is that they test for the presence of antibodies in your blood stream that your body makes when it encounters the infection. Since these antibodies take a while to produce, the test will not be immediately positive in a case of becoming exposed to HIV. In most people, the test will be positive with 2-3 months after an exposure if you are infected. However, in some people, the antibody test might not be positive until more than 6 months after becoming exposed. For this reason, even though having a negative test at 7 weeks is great news, it is not a sure thing that you have not become infected and, if there is a high level of concern, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> might want to repeat the test in a few months just to make sure. Also, no test is perfect at picking up HIV infection, and so there is no way to ever be 100% sure. 

This is a great issue to discuss with your primary care doctor. He or she can answer your questions about this issue and about the specific type of exposure you had. Please set up an appointment soon."
Am I anorexic or anemic?,"You certainly could be both anemic and anorexic based on the symptoms you are describing, and it is important to speak with your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> soon to ensure that you are healthy. It is common for vegetarians to have low blood levels due to the fact that meat is one of the best sources of the iron that is needed to make hemoglobin. There are other vitamins and minerals that are often not present in vegetarians as well, and so the appropriate diet must be carefully monitored. Anorexia is common in those who have had significant <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> and yet continue to feel that they have more weight they need to lose. The changes in your period are an indication that your body may not be appropriately supplied with fuel, as the body protects itself by disabling reproduction when the fat levels are at unhealthy lows. Your symptoms of passing out and dizziness can also signify that there is something that is not quite right. The key at this point is that you need help, and part of that help will come from speaking with a doctor about what is important to remain healthy. Please speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> immediately and describe your concerns in more detail to him or her. "
Do I have a blood clot in my nose?,"Nose bleeds are a very common medical problem, and they can occur in pretty much anyone, generally not indicating a major underlying medical condition. However, if they are very persistent or severe, then you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about them to see if any additional workup is needed. 

Most of the time, nose bleeds occur from drying out and irritation of the nose from cold, dry air (such as frequently occurs during the winter months). Your nasal passages may be dried out and irritated even if your nose does not ""feel dry"", as the dryness may occur higher up in the nasal passages than you can appreciate. 

Another common cause of nose bleeds are nasal allergies or sinus congestion, both of which contribute to inflamed and friable nasal mucosa. 

In a small percentage of cases, recurrent nose bleeds may be a sign of a previously undiagnosed problem with your blood's ability to clot effectively. For these reason, sometimes your primary care doctor might want to start a workup for clotting problems in the most persistent cases of nose bleeds, which typically means just some basic blood work and, if that is positive, referral to a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematology specialist</a>. Talk to your doctor soon!"
Could low iron levels be making me dizzy?,"Low iron levels are an important finding. Iron is an essential nutrient that is used in manufacturing hemoglobin, which is the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen. When hemoglobin levels are low, which they can be if you do not have sufficient iron available, this is called <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>. 

Anemia can have many potential symptoms, depending on how severe it is. Some of these symptoms can include dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, pale skin, and shortness of breath, especially with exercise. 

If your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> has performed a full examination (which it sounds like they have) and hasn't come up with anything else, then it could potentially be worthwhile treating the anemia (generally, this is done just by taking iron supplements). If the symptoms improve as your iron levels rise, then you will known that this was the cause!

Of course, it will be important to stay in close contact with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> over the next few months. In particular, if the symptoms of dizziness do not improve with iron supplementation, then it may be necessary to perform more testing to try to figure out what else might be going on. 

I hope you start to feel better soon!"
Can just scratching cause a bruise to form?,"A <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> is medically known as an ecchymosis. There are multiple reasons to have a bruise, not the least of which is trauma to the region. If you feel that your bruises are out of proportion to the degree of trauma, I would recommend you have this evaluated by your primary car physician. At the very least I would suggest that you see your primary <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> to evaluate your dry skin which is known as xerosis. 

A bruise represent damage to small blood vessels that allow blood to ""leak"" into the soft tissue and skin. Therefore it is a natural process to have a bruise with any trauma that damages blood vessels. 

However there are some conditions that cause people to bleed very or too easily. The major cause of this condition is if the blood is ""too thin."" bleeding disorders such as low platelets (the blood cell that helps clot form) of low blood levels of clotting proteins can cause this. Another common condition that can cause this is if the blood vessels are weak... As can be caused by inflammation. This is known as a <a href=""/procedure/vasculitis-1026"">vasculitis</a>. 

If you feel that the bruises are out of proportion to the physical trauma, you should see your doctor s there are medical conditions that can cause this. Good luck!"
Why would an 18-year-old male have a low white blood cell count?,"There are many potential causes for a low white blood cell count. If you, or someone you know well, has this problem, then the first step would be to seek a full evaluation from a <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a>. It is best to start with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> although, if the low white blood cell count persists, it may be necessary to involve a specialist, such as a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a>. 

By far the most common cause of a low white blood cell count is a transient decrease in the production of white blood cells by the bone marrow. This most commonly occurs in the setting of a viral infection. Most of the time, there is no need to do much in these cases except check serial blood counts to make sure the issue resolves. 

Low white blood cells counts are also often associated with various medications which can induce suppression of the bone marrow. It is therefore important to review with the doctor closely all medications that have been or have recently been taken. 

Most doctors will also work up low white blood cell count with basic tests for other common causes, most notably an HIV test and also a blood smear to look for abnormal cells (which might be concerning for a blood cancer). "
What does it mean if you have a low platelet count?,"The platelets, as you probably know, are one of the components of your blood that is involved in blood clotting. The exact level of platelets does tend to fluctuate up and down, depending on what else is going on with your health. For example, platelet counts may commonly fall with some viral infections that suppress their production transiently. Most of the time, this is no big deal, as the platelet count tends to recover. Since your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> did not seem to worried about the issue, I bet this is what they think is going on. It would be important to check your platelet count later on just to make sure that it has recovered, and you should talk with your primary care doctor to figure out when this repeat testing should occur. 

If your platelet counts remain low and do not recover, then this could be a sign of a more serious medical problem and it may need to be worked up more thoroughly. Your doctor will want to investigate for other obvious causes of low platelets (for example there are several prescription medications that can lower the platelet counts) and they may want to refer you to a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a>. "
Why did my doctor ask for a CBC and what is it?,"A CBC is a laboratory blood test. CBC stands for Complete Blood Count. It checks your blood for multiple things, including you white blood cell count (a marker of inflammation and/or infection), Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (levels of your red blood cells), platelets (clotting components), etc. 

Your lack of energy may be due to low red blood cells, which is also known as <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>. Red blood cells carry oxygen in your blood to all of your organs. Since oxygen is required for production of energy in your body, it is important that enough red blood cells are available to carry enough oxygen to produce a sufficent amount of energy. Anemia can be caused by many things, including increased degradation, occult loss, decreased production, or anemia of chronic disease. Sometimes the causes is reversible. For example, sometimes anemias can be related to low intake of certain vitamins and foods. 

A CBC is a good starting point in workup of lack of energy. It can show whether or not you are anemic and if so, which type of anemia you have. This may then further lead into more tests to work up the cause of the anemia and subsequently help to institute the appropriate treatment. Speak to your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> regarding the results and any further testing that he or she may want to perform."
Where did these bruises come from?,"Sometimes it is possible to accidentally bump into something or otherwise damage your skin and collect a few bruises without really remembering how! On the other hand, it sounds like you have multiple bruises all over your body, which makes this less likely. Therefore, I would go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible; they will be able to help you figure out what could be causing you to <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> so easily. 

The first thing your doctor will probably do is ask you about any medications you might be taking. This is because there are several types of medications which can thin the blood and lead to easy bruising; some of the most common medications that do this include warfarin and aspirin. 

Furthermore, they will probably ask about any family history of <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> disorders as well as ask you if you remember any other symptoms of easy bleeding or bruising (for example, heavy menstrual periods, nose bleeds), as these will help them narrow down the possibilities. 

Finally, they will probably want to get some basic bloodwork to look at your blood counts and your blood clotting times. 

Based on all of this information, they may be able to diagnose what is going on!"
What does it mean if I bruise easily?,"I would suggest that you discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who will be able to help you get to the bottom of this. 

One of the most common causes of easy bruising and <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> is taking medications that inhibit bleeding. For example, if you take aspirin or some other common anti inflammatory medications this could be enough to cause bruising. 

If this is not the result of medications, then you will need a workup to make sure you do not have a medical condition that is causing you to <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> easily. When you go to see your doctor, make sure to let them know if this is a recent development or if you have been having easy bruising your whole life. Also let them know if there are any other members of your family who have had bleeding problems. Also mention if you have had other signs of easy bleeding, such as frequent nose bleeds, heavy periods, blood in your bowel movements, etc. 

Your doctor will probably begin with some basic laboratory tests to look at your clotting and platelet function. Based on those results, they may decide to make a referral to a specialist in hematology. Again, please see your doctor soon. "
Is there a way to make bruises heal faster?,"Bruises in conspicuous places can be very frustrating!  Unfortunately, there is no specific way to accelerate the healing of a bruise, although strategically worn clothing or makeup can help make them less visible. A bruise represents bleeding under the skin, and the discoloration is from blood (almost like a  'scab' underneath your skin).  Your body will slowly breakdown and remove the trapped blood--and as the chemical component of blood break down the color changes from the initial dark blue/purple to greenish/bellow--but time is the only thing that results in a bruise going away.

However, as you note, the more significant question in your case is not how to make a bruise go away but why you seem to bruise so easily in the first place.  As mentioned above, bruising happens when there is bleeding under the skin.  This can occur because of expected trauma (you bump your knee on the side of the couch) or it can be the result of a problem with either the connective tissue forming blood vessels (i.e. they rupture too easily with only minor trauma) or the blood clotting system (when injury occurs the platelets and blood clotting factors in the blood don't work quickly enough to prevent significant blood loss and thus a large bruise).  

In your case, the best thing to do is make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care physician to discuss your concerns. He or she can take a more thorough history and physical exam to try and determine whether you are simply unlucky when it comes to injuries or whether more detailed testing is required to identify an underlying disorder of blood vessels or the clotting system that might explain your propensity to bruise.  Depending upon your doctor's findings, you may also be referred to a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> (blood cell specialist)."
Are there dangers involved with a blood transfusion?,"First of all, I have to remark that blood transfusions are safely received by millions of people every year without any problem at all. Doctors and blood banks work really hard to make sure that blood transfusions are safe, and most of the time they are. 

There are, however, some risks associated with blood transfusions. Most people have heard of the risk of infections like AIDS or hepatitis from blood transfusions. These days, blood is extensively tested for infections, so the chance of getting an infection from a blood transfusion is very, very small. 

More likely is what is called a transfusion reaction. This occurs when your body reacts to the foreign blood cells in the transfusion. Virtually all transfusion reactions are minor, causes just a rash or small <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. However, rarely, transfusions reactions can be very serious, even life-threatening. 

Because of these risks, which are overall quite small, your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> will always weigh the risks and benefits of a blood transfusion before giving you one. You will always have the opportunity to talk to your doctor about the transfusion beforehand, and you will always have the opportunity to refuse the transfusion if you wish or to ask any questions you might have. "
Is it safe to donate bone marrow?,"First of all, thank you for considering being a bone marrow donor! Bone marrow donations are life saving for many critically ill patients with cancers and other blood disorders, but access to this treatment is sometimes limited by a lack of willing donors like yourself!

Generally speaking, bone marrow donation is safe. It is a surgical procedure, which requires withdrawing bone marrow from a bone in your body with a large needle under sterile condition. This procedure would be painful if performed without medications, therefore the bone marrow donation is usually performed with anesthesia. 

Therefore, the main risks from donation are related to side effects from the anesthesia medications. The <a href=""/hematologists"">doctors</a> who run the bone marrow donation program work very hard to ensure your safety, and they perform a thorough physical examination prior to allowing you to donate, which is designed to detect any medical problems (such as a heart condition) that might make anesthesia dangerous. Therefore, if you have been medically cleared by these doctors to donate, then the risks are very low, as they would not allow you to proceed with the donation if they had any concerns. 

Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or to your local bone marrow transplant program if you have more questions!"
How would I know if my iron levels are too low?,"It is true that 'low iron levels' can cause fatigue. The medical term for this is <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>. It occurs because iron is required for making hemoglobin, which is the main oxygen carrying substance in the blood. If you don't have enough hemoglobin, you don't deliver enough oxygen to your body, which leads to symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, trouble exercising, etc. 

If you think you might be anemic then you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a check up. Anemia is most common in women who have heavy menstrual <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. It is less common in men, but it can occur. In addition to blood loss with menstruation, anemia can occur if you do not take in much iron in your diet, if you have certain genetic variants in your hemoglobin molecules, or for other reasons as well. The purpose of the checkup is to, first, confirm that you have anemia (which can be done with simple blood tests), figure out why you have anemia (so that a treatment can be prescribed), and, if you don't have anemia, investigate the other potential medical causes of feeling tired all of the time. 

As I said, the first step is seeing your primary care doctor!"
Is my white cell count too low?,"It sounds like you may have a problem with low white blood counts (WBC) as well as low platelets. White blood cells are your immune cells which are responsible for defending your body from microbes, allergens, cancers, and defective body cells. On the other hand, platelets are responsible for initiating blood clots and forming a ""seal"" when the skin/blood vessels have been injured.  A person can have conditions affecting one or both of these players. For example, people who are on immune suppressive medications like <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> may have very suppressed levels of WBC.  Patients with certain immune system disorders can have very low platelets to the point of being at risk for bleeding. Platelet counts are normally above 150,000. However, patients usually don't see problems with hemostasis until this level drops down to the low 10-20,000. Those with this low levels of platelets will often be given platelet transfer.  If this is so, you are certainly at risk with this low count.  A low white blood cell count is typically considered to be in the range lower than 3,500 white blood cells per microliter of blood and it makes you vulnerable to other diseases.  The normal range for white blood cell count is 4500 to 10,000 cells per microliter of blood.  Although not always, it can sometimes be a sign of an underlying medical problem.  Some of diseases associated with a low white blood cell count are viruses infecting bone marrow, cancers of the bone marrow, allergies, drugs, and autoimmune diseases that attack white blood cells or bone marrow.  Since white blood cells are your body's natural weapons to fight off infections and diseases, I suggest that you see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a referral to a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> to be evaluated and have your condition treated.  The doctor may treat you with medications to boost your count so that you will feel more energy and your immune system will be stronger.    "
How can I increase my endurance when I'm an anemic?,"One of the first things that you can do to improve your endurance is to correct your <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>, if you are able. Anemia is the medical name for having too few red blood cells in your body. Red blood cells carry oxygen, and so having too few of them causes your body to have a lack of oxygen and fatigue more quickly. 

In order to correct anemia appropriately, it is important to know why you are anemic. Many young women are anemic because of heavy menstrual cycles. These women can have some improvement in their blood levels if they increase their iron intake (an important building block of red blood cells), and occasionally through the use of oral contraceptives or other methods that help to closely regulate their periods. 

If you have a different cause of your anemia, the treatment will likely be different, but will be similar in that it will focus on addressing the primary cause as well as supplying the materials that your body needs to replace the blood cells that are lost, destroyed, or not created appropriately. 

Please speak with your <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> about the cause of your anemia, and which physical activities are appropriate for you to engage in. "
Why does anemia affect so many women?,"First let me describe what anemia is and then I’ll explain how it relates to women and why it is so common.  Generally speaking anemia is a low red blood cell count as defined by the hemoglobin level.  Red blood cells are the cells in the blood that are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.  The definition and diagnosis of anemia depends on the sex, age, and pregnancy status of a person.  Children and pregnant women can have lower levels of hemoglobin than men and non-pregnant women and still be classified as normal.  There are a number of causes of anemia ranging from genetic causes such as a condition called <a href=""/procedure/thalassemia-1230"">thalassemia</a> to vitamin and mineral deficiencies to simply <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>.  This last cause is usually associated with what is termed iron-deficiency anemia and is by far the most common cause of anemia.

Though iron deficiency anemia can be caused by getting enough iron in the diet or not being able to absorb iron from food, the most common cause is bleeding.  Blood is the major store of iron in the body, and iron is essential to make the major oxygen carrying compound in the red blood cell.  When iron stores are low the body is unable to make enough red blood cells and the condition that results is anemia.  Young women are unique because they lose a significant amount of blood every month through their period (menses), which is obviously not something that affects men or children.  Usually the solution is to increase the amount of iron in the diet of menstruating women to help build iron stores up.  Pleas talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, who can best evaluate your symptoms and discuss your options.  Good luck!"
Do kids with thalessemia need blood transfusions?,"Thalessemia is a series of disorders that can cause <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>, also known as low numbers of red blood cells.  The diseases are inherited from the parents to the child.  There are thalessemia versions range from silent (where you never even know you have it) to mild which require no treatment, to severe requiring blood transfusions.  If your baby has a severe thalessemia such as thalessemia major, then he or she may need blood transfusions to keep the red blood cell counts high enough.

Unfortunately, at the present day, there is no cure for thalessemia.  The blood transfusions are designed to replace the red blood cells that the body should have made on its own.  If blood transfusions are required, then they may need to occur periodically for you child's entire life.  

A child with thalessemia should have regular visits with a specialist.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a pediatric <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a>.  This is a <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> that specializes in blood disorders.  This doctor will be able to tell you what type of thalessemia your child has and how it will need to be treated.  This will also give you insight into the whether or not additional children you have in the future can be affected.  Good luck.  "
Is thalessemia a genetic disease?,"<a href=""/procedure/thalassemia-1230"">Thalassemia</a> is an inherited genetic condition and cannot be transmitted between two individuals, only parent to child. The genetic basis for thalassemia involves either a mutation or deletion in the DNA that is responsible for the production of different proteins (called globin chains) that make up hemoglobin, the molecule found in red blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen. 

A normal hemoglobin molecule is comprised of two alpha chains and two beta chains. Thalassemia can cause loss of either the alpha or beta chains, and the specific mutation correlates with the degree of anemia experienced by the patient. The level of anemia dictates the need for transfusions and other therapy. While some mild forms cause no significant anemia, very severe forms can be life-threatening. 

If you have any questions about thalassemia, you can talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, who can refer you to a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> for further questioning and investigation if needed. "
Is stereotactic radiation a type of surgical procedure?,"Stereotactic radiation is a procedure that utilizes radiation directed at a specific area of the body to kill or shrink of a tumor.  Sterotactic radiation does not use any surgical techniques and requires no cutting.  The best type of <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> for you to talk to about this technique is a radiation <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>.  

Radiation is often used in the treatment of cancer.  The advantages of providing radiation to a tumor is that the cancer cells can be killed without exposing the rest of the body to side effects.  However, since it only treats one part of the body at a time, radiation often does not result in a cure of the cancer if it is already metastatic.  

While surgical procedures are not involved in radiation therapy, often patients with cancer do require both techniques as a part of the whole cancer treatment.  Sometimes radiation is used prior to a <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to shrink a tumor and make it easier to take out.  Sometimes radiation is used after a surgery to increase the likelihood that all of the cancer was removed.

The type of doctor that you want to schedule an appointment with is a radiation oncologist.  This is the doctor who plans out and administers radiation when it is indicated.  Good luck.  "
What is the difference between a radiotherapy consultation and a radiology evaluation?,"Believe it or not, radiation oncology and radiology are two completely different fields of medicine that have very little in common.  A <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> is a <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> who performs medical imaging procedures to look at structures within the body.  They spend most of their time reading x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs.  They also spend there time performing biopsies under imaging guidance.  If your mother ever has an ultrasound, an x-ray, or a CAT scan, the radiologist is behind the scenes making sure that nothing in her body goes unnoticed.

On the other hand, a <a href=""/radiation-oncologists"">radiation oncologist</a> (or radiotherapist) is a doctor who uses beams of radiation to kill cancer cells in the body.  The doctor directs the beam of radiation directly at a tumor in order to kill the cancer cells and shrink the tumor.  Radiation therapy is used in some, but not all cancer treatments.  All cancer treatment plans involve imaging and thus, a radiology evaluation will definitely occur.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your mother's hematologist/oncologist.  He or she will be to explain what your mother's breast cancer treatment will consist of.  Most cancer treatment consists of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or some combination of all of them.  Good luck. "
Will I need a radiation oncology consultation if I've already had chemo?,"Radiation oncology is a special field of medicine that treats cancer patients in a different way than chemotherapy.  Some patients need radiotherapy, some need chemotherapy, and many need both.  The purpose of radiation therapy is to focus on killing cancer cells in a specific area of the body.  Radiation therapy often involves the patient sitting under a very focused beam of radiation that travels through the body and attacks cancer cells along with way.  The radiation often kills these cancer cells and makes the tumor smaller.  

Radiation therapy may be designed to cure a cancer and sometimes it is used to provide relief from symptoms that occur when a tumor becomes too big and presses on other structures in the body.  The advantage of radiation therapy is that is does not effect the rest of you body (like chemotherapy), just the area under the beam.  The disadvantages of it are that you have to come back every day for sometimes a month, and it only kills the cancer in one place.

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>, or <a href=""/radiation-oncologists"">radiation oncologist</a>, whoever you prefer.  This <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> will explain the benefits and side effects of radiation therapy in your particular situation with your type of cancer.  Good luck with your treatments.  "
Is radiation injury common in people who have cancer?,"Patients that have cancer are usually treated with one or a combination of therapies.  These therapies may include (but are not limited to), <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and biological therapy.  The last two are limited to certain situations.  Radiation therapy is designed to target and kill tumor cells in a specific area of the body.  It is done by using a beam of radiation that is aimed at a tumor.  The radiation damages the tumor cells and causes them to die.  This type of therapy is used to shrink a tumor that is causing someone unfavorable symptoms.  The side effects of the radiation are usually a sunburn like reaction on the skin, and an increase risk of other cancers down the road in the area that receives the radiation.  Usually these drawbacks are minor compared to the benefits.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment for your mother with her radiation <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>.  This <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> will be able to discuss all of the pros and cons, risks and benefits of having radiation therapy.  In almost every case, the benefits of this type of therapy far outweigh the risks.  It is still important to know about the side effects including the slight sunburn so that there are no surprises when they occur.  Good luck.  "
Is prostate cancer treatable?,"The answer to this question depends on many factors.  If you were diagnosed with prostate cancer, this means that you recently had a biopsy of your prostate that showed cancer cells.  While this would show that you do have prostate cancer, alone it does not tell what kind of treatment you will need, or what your overall prognosis is.  

If cancer cells are found on a prostate biopsy, the cancer is given a score called the Gleason score.  This scoring system is complicated, but is important to decide what treatment you will likely need, and what your overall prognosis is.  in most cases, prostate cancer is very treatable. The first question that will have to be answered is whether or not you will need your prostate removed.  The second step is whether or not you need hormonal therapy only, or hormonal therapy with chemotherapy.  There is even a class of prostate cancer in which no treatment (just watchful waiting) is required.  

Your first step should be to schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> / <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> that specializes in prostate cancer.  This <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> will be able to review your biopsy results with your and explain what the best treatment avenue would be best for you at this time.  "
How long does an iron pill prescription last?,"With any prescription, the <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> who wrote your prescription is responsible for assigning the dose of the medication as well as the number of pills and refills.  Iron deficiency <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a> is typically a chronic condition, and it is treated with iron therapy over long periods of time.  You should contact the physician who wrote the prescription to find out the anticipated duration of therapy, what tests or visits, if any, are needed prior to stopping the therapy, and how to obtain additional pills when you run out."
Are lung PET scans similar to breast PET scans?,"A PET (stands for positron emission tomography) scan is done as a part of a cancer work up when a cancer has already been found.  All PET scans are essentially similar in that they are designed to look for and find areas of the body where cancer is growing.  Pet scans usually encompass the whole body and thus, there is really no difference between a breast PET scan and a lung PET scan.  You should only have to go through the scanner one time to see any abnormalities in your breasts, lungs and abdomen.  

I should note that a PET scan is not something that is typically ordered by a primary <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> out in the community.  PET scans are not used as screening tests to look for cancer.  They are usually done when a cancer has been found already, and there is a desire to see if it has metastasized.  

I think the type of doctor qualified to discuss your PET scan result would be a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> / <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>.  This is a specialist that treats people for cancer and would be the best equipped to evaluate a PET scan and be able to interpret its results.  Good luck. "
How can I explain a pediatric oncology consultation to my child?,"Unfortunately, there is no perfect way to go about this.  When a child develops cancer, both the him or her and the parents are in such a tough spot, talking about it plainly so that the child can understand is very difficult.  The best thing to be is both honest and hopeful all the time.  Your child will need a lot of encouragement and feedback about how brave he is.  The fact that your child has a PCP that he trusts is a very positive thing.  In addition, I would encourage his PCP to assist in explaining what will happen as the treatment of his cancer unfolds.  The only problem that will occur with this is that the PCP may not know exactly what is going to happen, and may not be comfortable talking about it without the full knowledge of the treatment plan.  

Most pediatric oncologists are very skilled at interacting with and explaining to both children and parents about what cancer treatment entails.  They have to be in order to do their job effectively.  Thus, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your son's <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> so that you can get a rundown of the plan for his treatment.  After 1-2 visits with this <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a>, you will know whether are you comfortable with him or her explaining things to your son.  I hope that answer helped.  "
Will I find out how to reduce the number of nose bleeds my son has after a pediatric hematology follow up?,"The answer to your question depends on what workup has already been done for your son's nose bleeds and what is already known.  When a child presents to his or her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> with the complaint of very frequent nose bleeds, the common causes must be ruled out.  The common causes of nose bleeds in kids includes mechanical trauma (often from picking), or irritation from an upper respiratory track infection.  

Other more rare causes of frequent nose bleeds include a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.  If nose bleeds run in the family, then this is a possibility.  If your son also gets bruised easily, then he may have a blood clotting problem that makes his nose bleed at the smallest amount of trauma.  If this is the case, then a <a href=""/hematologists"">hematologist</a> will be very helpful.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with the hematologist.  This doctor will want to know details about your son's nose bleeds and will likely want details on your family's medical history.  Your son will need to have his blood drawn because the hematologist will want to make sure that he does not have a blood clotting problem.  If nothing is found, or if the hematologist cannot fine the cause of the nose bleeds, you need to schedule an appointment with an ear nose and <a href=""/ear-nose-throat-doctors"">throat doctor</a>.  An ENT doc will be able to examine his nose more closely and find the source, and possibly the cause of the bleeding.  "
What causes Osteoscarcoma in adolescents?,"I agree - this is so unfair.  This is a diagnosis that is heartbreaking no matter how many times I see it.  Unfortunately, the cause of osteosarcoma is unknown.  The cancer comes from cells that normally make bone.  At some point in their lives, they acquire mutations in their DNA which cause them to become cancerous.  Most likely there is a component of inherited genes that makes certain people more susceptible than others.  

The prognosis of osteosarcoma and overall survival depends on its stage.  Basically the stage of the cancer is determined by the size of the tumor and the presence or absence of metastasis.  No matter what stage the disease presents itself, the tumor must be cut out surgically.  This sometimes means amputation of the effected limb (though not always).  Stage 1 disease has an excellent overall prognosis with most people surviving the cancer.  Stage 3 disease is more advanced, and the likelihood of long term survival (more than 10 years) is much less.  

The type of <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> that your friend's daughter must see is an <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>.  The oncologist will be responsible for the staging of the cancer, and the administration of chemotherapy.  An <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> specially trained in bone cancers will also be involved in the resection of the tumor.  I wish her the best of luck.  "
How can I manage the stress of an oncology consultation?,"Oncology consultations are <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> provoking. However it is important to know that the advances in therapeutics in oncology is changing everyday with new promising medications. In addition, one type of cancer does not equal all types of cancer, so your experience with treatment and outcome may be very different that someone else with the same cancer and someone else with a different type of cancer. 

How to manage with an <a href=""/procedure/oncology-consultation-383"">oncology consultation</a> depends in part on what your coping mechanisms are. Do you find comfort in confiding with family members or having a family member or close friend accompany you? Do you find relaxation in mind/body centered activities such as meditation or yoga? Can you identify what gives you peace (music, reading books, art) or what activities can serve as a distraction (reading, movies, taking extracurricular classes)? Avoiding the internet prior to your consultation will help with the anxiety. 

As mentioned above, every case is different. Ask your <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> what sites he/she recommends as a trustworthy source of information. In addition, there are various support groups that might be helpful in coping with the anxiety and with the experience. Your nails may take a hit as you search for what can help give you peace, but with time and support you will be able to manage your anxiety."
Is Lymphoma likely to cause night sweats?,"I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Lymphoma is a cancer in which the immune system cells (lymphocytes) have a genetic mutation causing them to multiply abnormally.  These abnormal cells form aggregations in the lymph nodes, which are sites along the body where normal lymphocytes typically reside. There are many variants of lymphoma, which differ based on the specific type of lymphocyte and the genetic material (DNA) in the cancerous cells.  A hematologist/<a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> is the type of <a href=""/hematologists"">doctor</a> that specializes in lymphoma, and can tell you more about the symptoms and treatment of lymphoma.  

Lymphoma, like other cancers, tends to cause ""constitutional symptoms,"" also called ""B symptoms,"" meaning symptoms that affect the entire body.  These symptoms occur in up to 40% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  They include fevers, chills, and night sweats.  The reason for these symptoms is small chemicals called ""cytokines,"" which the cancerous lymphocytes produce, or which may be produced by normal immune system cells that are trying to fight off the cancerous ones.  These cytokines are inflammatory and cause the generalized symptoms, including night sweats.

Other conditions can also cause night sweats, such as infections, thyroid disease, and certain medications including some antidepressants. You should speak with your oncologist or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> regarding these other conditions."
How long does it take to get the results from a leg venous doppler?,"Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which some of the larger veins in your body can develop a blood clot. This is most commonly seen in the legs, but can occur in any vein including arms, intestinal veins (e.g. portal vein), etc. There are many reasons for why thrombosis occurs, but primarily there are three events (""Virchow's triad"") that can precipitate the event. 1. Venous stasis (meaning decreased blood flow through a vein - for example from sitting on a long trans-atlantic flight causing decreased blood flow in the leg veins). 2. Endothelial damage (any sort of trauma to the leg). 3. Hypercoagulable condition (e.g. <a href=""/procedure/clotting-disorders-1124"">clotting disorders</a>, pregnancy, cancer, etc).  

Since your questions asks about a leg blood clot, that is what I'll focus on from here on out. When a clot forms in the leg, it may cause swelling, redness, increased warmth and pain in the leg (most commonly in the calf). More worrisome is the chance of the clot breaking off and propagating to the central venous circulation and embolizing to the lungs. That is why DVTs are treated with anti-coagulation from 3-6 months (first episode) to lifetime (multiple episodes, or prior history of pulmonary embolism). 

Diagnosis is achieved by performing a Doppler <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the legs. The test itself takes 15-30 minutes to perform. The timing of the result depends on who interprets the findings (radiology technician, <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a>, vascular medicine physician, etc). Generally speaking the result should be available within several hours but can take up to a day. 

It is highly recommended you follow up with your physician regarding the results of this test and possibly need to treat a DVT if one is found. Failure to treat a newly discovered DVT can cause significant complications."
Do hemorrhoids cause loose stools?,"Typically hemorrhoids do not cause symptoms of <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a> or loose stool. Hemorrhoids are normal structures found in the anal canal that are made of small blood vessels and connective tissue. They are helpful in their usual state because they act like cushions to help the passage of stool. They cause symptoms when they become inflamed, swollen or irritated. These symptoms usually consist of <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>, itching, and pain. Hemorrhoids located within the rectum do not cause pain and usually cause painless bright red bleeding seen on the toilet paper or covering the stool. External hemorrhoids (those protruding outside of the rectum) on the other hand can be a significant source of pain in addition to bleeding, and this pain may be exacerbated with bowel movements. 

Simple and cost-effective options for the prevention and treatment of hemorrhoids include softening the stool with a combination of medication (eg docusate sodium), increasing dietary fiber intake, and maintaining appropriate fluid intake. For further symptomatic relief, sitz baths, anti-inflammatory medications, and topical creams may help. If the hemorrhoids are a persistent source of pain and conservative measures fail to bring relief, then referral to a colorectal <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> may be needed, where procedures such as rubber band ligation can be performed."
Can one get rid of hemorrhoids?,"There are a number of options to treat <a href=""/procedure/hemorrhoids-1072"">hemorrhoids</a> in addition to the treatments found over the counter.  First, it's important to know that there are two types of hemorrhoids: internal and external.  Internal hemorrhoids can cause bleeding and discomfort, but are typically not as painful, whereas external steroids are supplied by a different part of the nervous system and can be quite painful.

First, and perhaps the most important treatment is to change your bowel habits to help prevent hemorrhoids from continuing to occur.  Hemorrhoids occur because of an increase in pressure inside your abdomen which is transmitted to the blood vessels around the anus and can occur from a number of reasons including straining while having a bowel movement.  To prevent straining you should eat a diet that is rich in fiber and also stay well hydrated.  These measures alone may significantly reduce your symptoms.  The next simple treatment is topical steroids which can decrease symptoms of itching and discomfort.  A primary care <a href=""/colorectal-surgeons"">doctor</a> can prescribe either topical steroids for external hemorrhoids or steroid suppositories for internal steroids.  However, it is important to know that steroids should only be used for occasional and short-term treatment.  

If the hemorrhoids are more significant there are other procedures to treat them.  The first option is banding of the hemorrhoids, which is frequently the most successful.  A band is placed around the hemorrhoids which will cut off the blood supply and cause the hemorrhoid tissue to die and be shed.  If this therapy is not successful two other options are sclerotherapy where a chemical agent is injected into the hemorrhoid tissue and causes the tissue to slough off and scar.  Another option is called infrared photocoagulation which uses radiation to achieve the same results.  However, with all of these options it is important to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> who can evaluate your hemorrhoids and help direct you to the appropriate therapy.

What is to be expected (normal and abnormal) after having sex for the first time with a condom?,"After intercourse, there are many things that can happen. First of all, it is important to consider your overall well-being. This can be a time of many emotions, and having someone close that you can talk this through with, like a parent or a <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>, may be important. Second, it is important to know if there was a rupture in the condom or if there is a reason to expect that there may have been. Condoms are not perfect at preventing either pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, and so there is always a risk of failure and you should discuss this with a doctor. If you are concerned that you may have become pregnant, there are early pregnancy tests that are quite effective at diagnosing a pregnancy, even very early. For most women, however, the first sign of a pregnancy is a missed period. This may be more obvious if you are quite regular, and less so if you are not. Breast tenderness is another common early sign, and generally precedes the symptoms of nausea and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> that we commonly think about. If you have any thoughts that you may be pregnant, please take a prenatal vitamin and avoid alcohol and tobacco, as these will all help your potential baby to be healthy. Again, please speak to your doctor. "
Can implantation bleeding last as long as a period?,"If you had unprotected sex within the last several weeks, it is possible that you are pregnant and you should see your physician or gynecologist.  
As you know, in general your period will not change drastically from month to month without other underlying changes in your health.  If your period now is different than what it normally is and you are otherwise feeling well and have not had any significant changes in your life, then it is possible that the spotting you are experiencing is related to embryo <a href=""/procedure/implantation-of-fertilized-egg-s-1287"">implantation</a> early during a pregnancy.  The best way to determine whether you are or are not pregnant and to make sure that you are not putting your health at risk from unprotected sexual contact is to make an appointment to see your physician or gynecologist for a pregnancy test and exam.  Your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> can do a blood test which will identify the hCG hormone produced during pregnancy.  This blood test is more accurate than the home urine tests one can buy over the counter.  In addition, your doctor can also test you for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted infections.  Some STDs can cause significant harm over time if left untreated, and a woman may not always have symptoms of infection. Take care, and best of luck."
Did natural progesterone cream mess up my cycle?,"Overall there are many different reasons why you might not have had your period yet or be experiencing some mood changes.  If you are sexually active, pregnancy is always a possibility, and a home pregnancy test is not definitive  as there is a short window in which a urine pregnancy test will be negative even when a woman is in fact pregnant.  In addition, taking hormones of any kind, whether natural or synthetic, has the potential to affect a woman's reproductive cycle or overall health.  In this situation, the best thing for you to do is see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss your concerns.  In particular, he or she might be able to suggest some more effective methods of treating or managing your PMS symptoms in a way that is safe for the rest of your health.  Taking estrogen or progesterone that is not prescribed or monitored by a physician can have some adverse effects on your health and you want to be sure to discuss any of these medications or supplements with a physician.  Depending upon your age and other health issues, your primary care physician may also refer you to a gynecologist to discuss further.  Finally, if pregnancy is a concern for you, you can also have a blood test with your physician to be completely sure."
Why does my cervix feel like a donut? ,"It sounds like the last few days have been very stressful for you.  The best thing for you to do right now would be to see your OB/GYN in clinic as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and your concerns.  Your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> can also examine you, including a pelvic exam to help determine if there are any problems.  Lab testing, including a blood test for the hCG hormone produced when a woman is pregnant, can also help say with certainty whether you are pregnant or not.  It will be helpful for your doctor to hear about the symptoms you state you have been having, as you could certainly be pregnant if you have been having unprotected intercourse, but depending upon your symptoms, there could definitely be other explanations for these changes in your health and it will be important for your doctor to make sure that you don't need any other kinds of evaluation.  

In addition, it is likely not a good idea to check your own cervix at home.  You can speak with your OB/GYN more about this, but if there is a concerning change in your health, the best thing to do is seek medical attention right away."
Is it possible to get pregnant if I have sex one day after my period?,"The most likely time to become pregnant during the menstrual cycle is near ovulation, the time when an egg is released from the ovaries and travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus.  If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus degenerates and sloughs off in a menstrual period.  In a typical 28-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs on day 14, with the time just before and after ovulation being the most fertile time in a woman's cycle.  However, it is absolutely possible for a woman to become pregnant on any day of her cycle.  Although the timing of a period is often used as a surrogate to count backwards and determine when ovulation occurred, in some women it is not uncommon for the biology of the oocyte not to match perfectly with the biology of the uterine lining.  And, it is the oocyte that determines pregnancy, not the status of menstrual <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>.  Since sperm can be viable for several days after ejaculation, it is possible for intercourse several days before or after ovulation to result in pregnancy.  Overall, if you are concerned about pregnancy, the best thing to do is make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss pregnancy testing as well as your interest in either becoming pregnant (pre-partum health counseling) or preventing pregnancy (<a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">contraception</a> options)."
Am I pregnant?,"Urine pregnancy tests such as the ones you can buy over the counter work by detecting a hormone called hCG which is released into the urine by pregnant women.  Blood tests, which can be performed at a doctor's office, test for hCG in the blood and are thus more sensitive and able to pick up a pregnancy earlier than the urine-based home tests.  It is certainly possible that you are pregnant at this time given that you had unprotected intercourse.  A home pregnancy test is most likely to be accurate when used after the date of a missed period.  If you have a 28 day cycle and your last period was February 28th, then a home test is most likely to be accurate when used after a missed period on or around March 28th.  However, a blood test at a physician's office can show that you are pregnant approximately one week after ovulation.  If you ovulated halfway through your cycle (March 14th), then blood tests may be be able to show a pregnancy as early as March 20th.  If you had sex more than once this cycle, then it is impossible to say when your actual conception date was.  The best way to determine if you are pregnant and protect your health is to make an appointment with your physician for a pregnancy test."
Why does my uterus feels like it's bloated or is stretching?,"If you have recently had unprotected intercourse, the first important thing to do is determine whether or not you are pregnant.  Some women may have mild <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> or cramping at the time of embryo <a href=""/procedure/implantation-of-fertilized-egg-s-1287"">implantation</a>, but this is not something that would typically cause the type of symptoms you are describing.  It is important for you to see your physician right away to consider whether or not taking medication to prevent pregnancy, the so-called morning after pill, is something that you would want to take.  You will also need regular follow-up to ensure that you find out whether you are pregnant right away.

Next, it seems that you are also having some other unexpected and unpleasant symptoms, including your dizzy spells and what you describe as bloating of your uterus.  In a non-pregnant woman, the uterus is not palpable or visible in the abdomen (it is small enough to remain in the pelvis and would not extend up into the abdomen) which means something else must be causing your abdominal bloating.  There are many different possibilities, and determining the cause of your symptoms will require a more thorough history including your past health history as well as a physical exam.  Hopefully you and your physician can determine what is causing these new symptoms so you can get back to your regular state of good health. Book an appointment today."
Do these symptoms mean I'm pregnant?,"The symptoms that you are describing are not specific for any one condition and can be due to a variety of underlying problems, so I recommend an examination from a <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> right away. To answer your direct question, these symptoms could certainly be due to pregnancy. Many women experience spotting or light bleeding early in pregnancy, which can occur as early as the time of conception (when the egg is fertilized) in the middle of your usual menstrual cycle. Abdominal cramping can accompany this bleeding and can be benign in nature. Alternatively, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> can be a sign of a dangerous underlying process such as an ectopic pregnancy, when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus. 

Abdominal pain and vaginal discharge/bleeding can also be a sign of an infection, such as in pelvic inflammatory disease. In this condition, infection can involve the uterus and the fallopian tubes and lead to complications such as infertility and abscess formation. Pelvic inflammatory disease is often the result of a sexually-transmitted disease such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, and is treated with antibiotics. 

The dizziness and fatigue are also non-specific symptoms and can be a signal that you are dehydrated, pregnant or suffering from an underlying infection, among other conditions. As the cause of your various symptoms is unclear and there are dangerous consequences of leaving conditions such as infection or ectopic pregnancy untreated, it is advised that you seek out immediate care from the local emegency room, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or ob/gyn provider. Book an appointment today!"
How do I figure out the date of conception?,"Determining the date of conception is typically done in one of two different ways, either through counting backwards from the last menstrual period or through <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> dating based on specific features of the fetus associated with a specific stage of development.

Going by the date of your last menstrual period, your estimated due date would be August 29, 2013 with a date of conception of December 6, 2012.  

Going by your ultrasound date, the date of conception would be December 8, 2012.

Both the last menstrual period and ultrasound dating are both estimates, not iron-clad guarantees of certainty, so it is impossible to say with 100% certainty exactly when conception occurred.  However, given that both methods are placing a date of conception in early December, it seems statistically most likely that you conceived on December 5th.

It sounds like you are already taking steps to help with medical management of your pregnancy in getting an ultrasound.  It is important to make sure that you have regular visits with your obstetrician during pregnancy to make sure you stay in good health during your pregnancy and have the best possible outcome.  Your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> can also answer any other questions you may have about pregnancy."
Noticed a slight ovarian pressure after sex....am I pregnant?,"While it sounds like you are doing an excellent job with taking the <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">birth control</a> pills, no form of hormonal (ie birth control pills) or barrier (ie condoms) is 100% effective at preventing pregnancy. It's a good idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB/GYN for a definitive pregnancy test.  Even with perfect use, birth control pills are still only 91-98% effective at preventing pregnancy with unprotected sex.  While that seems pretty good, it means that on average if you have unprotected sex 10-20 times, even with using the pill perfectly (as it seems you have been) you will become pregnant.  Said in another way, there is about a 5-10% chance you will get pregnant if you have unprotected sex on the pill.  In addition, the pill does not provide any protection against sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV/ AIDS, chlamydia, gonorrhea, etc.) whereas a condom affords some protection (still not perfect, but certainly much better than nothing) against these infections. A combination of the pill and a condom not only is safer in terms of sexually transmitted infections, but is also more effective at preventing pregnancy.  All of that being said, it will be important for you to see a physician in the near future to be tested for sexually transmitted infections as well as a pregnancy test.  "
"What can cause dyspnea (air hunger), bloating in the upper digestive track, and weight gain?","This is certainly an uncomfortable constellation of symptoms, as well as potentially concerning for an underlying medical condition.  While it is not possible to make a diagnosis without having an actual office visit, taking a more thorough history and performing a physical exam, there are several possible causes for your bothersome symptoms and would urge you to further discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.
1) Congestive heart failure: it is possible that the your symptoms are due to mild or moderate heart failure.  When the heart is in failure, it is less efficient at pumping blood forward, so blood becomes 'congested' in your body's blood vessels.  This can cause dyspnea from pulmonary edema (fluid backing up into the lungs), bloating or increased abdominal distention from blood/fluid backing up into the gut wall, liver and other abdominal organs, and weight gain from backing up of fluid into the skin, causing swelling or edema (most commonly in the ankles and legs).
2) Diabetes: there is a strong association between PCOS and diabetes.  potentially the bloating is due to gastroparesis (delayed emptying of the stomach) in the setting of uncontrolled diabetes,  the bloating/distention itself could be causing the shortness of breath if your abdomen is becoming distended enough to exert pressure on your diaphragm, thus making it hard to get in a good, deep breath.
3) Dietary intolerance: it is possible that even though you are cutting out common 'gas-inducing' foods, you still may have an intolerance to a type of food or a food group (eg: dairy) that is causing your symptoms.  A food journal may be helpful in sorting this out.
I hope you find this information helpful, but please continue to work with your primary care doctor on these issues."
What can cause lower abdominal pain and pressure?,"There are a variety of possibilities as to the cause of the lower abdominal cramping and pressure you are experiencing. It's a good idea to discuss this issue with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> to determine which could be the case.

If your menstrual cycle is late and you are sexually active, there is always a possibility of pregnancy. While the over-the-counter tests are very accurate, they are not perfect and an early pregnancy may not be detected. In the event of pregnancy, an ectopic location of the embryo within the Fallopian tube can lead to severe pain and cramping and can be a serious condition that needs emergent medical/surgical attention. Alternatively, your symptoms may be due to an impending menstrual cycle. Some women experience increasing cramping and pain prior to bleeding and you may find that your menstrual cycle begins shortly. Lower abdominal cramping can also signify a <a href=""/procedure/urinary-tract-infection-1005"">urinary tract infection</a> (UTI) involving inflammation of the bladder. Supporting a UTI as the cause would be symptoms of burning or pain with urination, cloudy urine, or foul-smelling urine. As the exact cause of your symptoms is not evident, it is advised that you seek out the care of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> immediately so that he/she can conduct a more thorough medical interview and physical exam and order the relevant tests to exclude the above diagnoses.

Can you get your period for a 2nd time in the same month?,"If you ever have a concern about whether or not you should speak with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>, the safest bet is to speak with your doctor. Even if all they do is reassure you, sometimes that confirmation can be priceless. Please speak with your OB/GYN. If you are unable to make an appointment to see them shortly, your family care doctor would also likely be able to help you to make sure that everything is OK. Now, to address your current concerns, it would certainly make the most sense to think that this has something to do with the emergency contraceptive pill. You don't mention the date that you had unprotected intercourse, and that could explain quite a bit of your current situation. If you had been in the early stages of pregnancy, the cramping and the passing of the thicker than normal <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> could be some of the early gestational products, although that is not certain. There are many other things that can cause cramping and vaginal bleeding outside of your regular cycle, but the best thing for you to do at this time would be to see your doctor and be evaluated to make sure that you are well. Please book an appointment and speak to your doctor. "
What affect does Klacid have on an embryo?,"First of all, congratulations on being pregnant! This question about which medications are safe to take during pregnancy is a very important one, and is something that you should definitely follow up with your obstetrician about for more information. 

Amoxicillin and Nexium are both classified as category ""B"" pregnancy drugs, which means there is no evidence that they cause any harm during pregnancy. Klacid (clarithromycin), on the other hand, is classified as a category ""C"" drug, which means that either there is some evidence that the medication may be harmful or that there is no available data to know whether or not the medication is harmful. At the same time, the absolute risk to the growing baby from most category C drugs is really generally very low.  

Most likely, what your obstetrician will want to do is perform a thorough examination and then proceed with the usual ultrasounds and growth monitoring that is part of standard prenatal care. These interventions are likely to pick up any problems or concerns with the pregnancy and, if any concerns emerge, your obstetrician will be able to help you decide what, if anything, needs to be done when they emerge. Book an appointment to discuss the with your doctor!

Good luck!"
Will a gynecologist call CPS for a positive drug test taken at a 6 week postpartum check-up?,"This is a difficult question, as there is more to the question than just a simple yes or no answer. Many drugs that are medically prescribed can show up as a positive value on a drug toxin screening, and so more information would be necessary before I could definitively answer in either direction. The most important thing is that your friend's gynecologist will be worried about both the health of her patient and the health of her new baby. If the <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> ordered a drug test, it is likely because she was worried about something unusual. If she feels that the drug use is potentially a threat to the child--as it almost undoubtedly will be in one form or another--she or he may feel that it is his or her duty to call child protective services or another agency that will be able to help all parties involved. 
You, however, can be proactive and make sure that both the baby and the mother are well. At this difficult postpartum time, please provide support and make sure that there are always others available to help both mom and baby. Please speak to your friend and determine if she is getting the medical care that she needs and has the resources she needs to be safe. Please encourage her to speak about this in detail to her doctor. "
I am 7 weeks pregnant with a hernia &amp; menstrual type cramping. How serious are these symptoms?,"I would strongly recommend that you go to see your OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> about these symptoms right away. If the pain is severe or worsening, or accompanied by nausea, <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>, or fevers, then I would not wait to see your OB GYN doctor but would, instead, go to an emergency room for more immediate treatment. 

The concern here is that your hernia may have incarcerated. As you probably know, a hernia occurs when a defect in the abdominal wall allows contents of the abdomen (intestines and fat) to protrude outwards through the defect. Usually, this does not cause an immediate problem, but sometimes the muscles in the abdominal wall can contract around the protruding hernia, cutting off blood flow. This is called incarceration, and it is an emergency, because it requires immediate medical intervention, usually <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, to restore blood flow to the contents of the hernia. 

Your doctor will be able to tell quickly whether or not there is evidence that your hernia is incarcerating and, if so, arrange expeditious surgical intervention to correct the problem. If there is no evidence of incarceration of the hernia, they will also be able to help you figure out where else the pain may be coming from.

"Why do I have a brownish, yellowish discharge after my C-section?","This is something you should definitely discuss with you OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>.

After being pregnant, it takes some time for the uterus to return to to its normal pre-pregnancy size. Part of this process, known as uterine involution, includes the shedding of some excess tissue and fluid from the uterus out the vagina. This process can take several weeks to conclude, and it occurs to some extent in both vaginal birth as well as cesarean section births. 

This is one of the issues that your OB GYN doctor will take a look at when you go to your six week post partum checkup, which should be coming up in the next week or two! In addition to making sure that the discharge you are describing is of normal volume and consistency for how far out from the birth you are (i.e., that there is no evidence of infection or delayed healing), they will also see how you are doing on other fronts. 

For example, they may check for signs of <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a> and make sure that your blood counts are coming up normally after the blood loss from the cesarean. They will also ask about your mood, to make sure there is no evidence of postpartum <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>, and make sure you are not having any issues with breastfeeding, infant care, etc.

If you haven't already done so, book a follow-up appointment with your OB GYN doctor today!"
Is there something wrong if your threads of Mirena are outside of the body? ,"The threads on the end of the Mirena intra uterine device are there to help you make sure that the device is in the proper place. Therefore, any major change in position of the strings (either not feeling them any more at all or feeling them extend a lot farther than they used to) should prompt a visit to your gynecologist to make sure that the device is still in the right place.

I'm afraid that the combination of spotting over the past few days together with feeling the strings now protruding from the vagina suggests that the Mirena device may have become dislodged downward from the uterus - for example in may be stuck partially in the cervix. Your gynecologist will be able to tell what is going on most likely with a simple pelvic examination, using a speculum to get a better look at the strings and the position of the device.

If the device is dislodged, it will probably need to be removed and replaced. On the other hand, if it has just shifted downwards a bit inside the uterus, the strings may just need to be trimmed a bit. 

Make an appointment with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> today!"
What can cause vaginal spotting for almost three weeks?,"I would definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor about this issue. Three weeks of unexplained spotting is a long time, and it is worth getting some helping figuring out what might be going on. 

The first thing your doctor will want to to do is perform a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. This will help them rule out some of the causes of spotting, such as a <a href=""/procedure/vaginal-discharge-infection-481"">vaginal infection</a>, or an infection or ulcer on the cervix. Based on what they find with this initial examination, they may also want to get additional studies, such as basic blood work to look at things like the levels of thyroid hormone (which can cause irregular periods) as well as an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> to look at the anatomy of the uterus and ovaries. 

If you continue to have this problem, then another cause that your doctor will want to consider is something called polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is one of the most common causes of irregular periods and spotting and which is more common in women who are overweight. 

Start by making an appointment to be seen at your earliest convenience. "
Why was my period 20 days late?,"There are several different possible explanations for why your period may have been late. If this continues to be a problem, then it would be a great idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor for additional workup. 

One possibility is that your period may have been late because of stress, fatigue, an acute <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>, or a change in your sleep patterns, and all of these can affect the hormone signals from the brain to the ovaries that regulate the period. 

Another possibility is that you may have been pregnant, but that you subsequently had a miscarriage of the pregnancy. Very early miscarriages are extremely common, and they may have no overt symptoms (like heavy <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> or cramping) other than causing the period to be delayed. A very early pregnancy may be too small to cause the pregnancy test to be positive. 

There are numerous other hormonal causes of delayed periods, such as problems with the thyroid gland or polycystic ovarian syndrome; however, these don't typically need to be looked for unless the irregular periods are occurring frequently, at which point you should see your doctor. 

It's a good idea to book an appointment your physician!"
What would an ovarian cyst be pressing on to cause back pain and upset stomach?,"I'd recommend discussing this with your OB GYN immediately and letting them know that your symptoms have not improved and, in fact, or getting worse. I suspect that, with this information in hand, they will probably want to proceed with the <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> and visit sooner, to see if the cyst on your ovary is getting worse or if you have developed any new findings. The initial approach of ""watchful waiting"" was definitely appropriate, as many ovarian cysts are transient, but it is worth taking another look now that you are continuing to have persistent, severe symptoms. 

At the same time, many of your symptoms are not totally consistent with those that would be caused by a large ovarian cyst. In particular, this doesn't explain the pain in your back with radiation down your leg. Given the rest of your medical history, which includes spinal fusion surgery, I wonder if your symptoms might be a complication of your surgery or even the reemergence of nerve pinching symptoms. I'd recommend, therefore, also talking with your back <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue to see what workup might be needed to see how things are healing in your back."
What are the risks of salmonella during pregnancy?,"If your wife is pregnant and there is a concern of exposure to salmonella, then the first step would be to go see your regular OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> who is overseeing the pregnancy. They will be able to check everything out and make sure that there are no signs of a problem. 

Salmonella is a type of bacteria which is commonly transmitted in certain food types, such as undercooked poultry or eggs. It is often also carried by certain pets, especially reptiles like turtles. The infection can cause <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, fever, and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>. It also, in rare cases, can be passed through the placenta to the baby and cause a serious infection. Also, if the salmonella is active during the birthing process, it may be passed to the baby from the mother as it exits the birth canal. 

Your wife's OB GYN doctor will be able to determine if there are any active signs of an infection or if there is any need to check the baby for any complications. They'll also be able to give you advice on how to avoid potential exposures to more salmonella during the remainder of the pregnancy. 

Please make an appointment today."
What could be the cause of redness and itching of the clitoris?,"Since this has been going on for a few weeks without getting better, it would definitely be a good idea to see either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor for an opinion about what is going on. 

One possibility is that this could be a yeast infection. Yeast infections of the vagina and the surrounding structures are very common, and they tend to cause the sort of redness and itching that you are describing. Other symptoms might include vaginal discharge, which is usually white. 

Another possibility is that this is an allergic or contact reaction. For example, many individuals might have this reaction to new soaps or other personal care products that they are sensitive to. It would be a good idea to think about whether there are any new products that you are using, as these might have triggered the problem. 

Your doctor will be able to take a look and help figure out exactly what is going on. If this turns out to be a yeast infection, it should clear up nicely with a topical anti-fungal medication. On the other hand, if this is a contact or allergic reaction, it may require a steroid cream to clear up, or it may just require identifying and removing the offending agent.

What can causes urinating from the vagina?,"It would be best to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor so that you can get to the bottom of this! They will be able to perform a vaginal exam and help you figure out where this liquid you are noticing might be coming from. 

By far the most likely possibility is that you've had an increase in vaginal discharge, which might feel like urination but probably is not. There are several different types of vaginal infections that can lead to an increase in discharge. These include several sexually transmitted infections (like chlamydia or gonorrhea) as well as non-sexually transmitted infections (like bacterial vaginosis). 

It is also possible to notice increases in vaginal mucus discharge at different stages in your menstrual cycle, and this can be normal. 

Your doctor will be able to examine any discharge that you might have and potentially perform some laboratory testing for various possible infections. If the examination or the testing turns up anything, they will be able to recommend the appropriate treatment, which might include a prescription for antibiotics. 

Make an appointment with your primary care doctor or OB GYN at your earliest convenience."
What is a bicornuate uterus?,"Bicornuate uterus is an uncommon splitting of the upper parts of the uterus which then fuse lower down so that the lower parts of the cervix and external genitalia are one. This occurs due to some failure of fusion of the parts that ultimately create the uterus during gestation. In and of itself, it will not usually affect your life significantly. It can, however, make pregnancy more difficult. People with a bicornuate uterus who wish to become pregnant should speak with a high risk obstetrician before doing so to see what they can do to decrease risks to themselves and their baby. Some women will also have difficulty becoming pregnant, and those who do become pregnant may have more difficulty carrying the baby to full term. If you are not at a point where you are considering becoming pregnant, speaking directly with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> who diagnosed you should also be able to provide some further details that can benefit you and help you to realize that you are not alone and are not somehow defective. If you are not getting the answers that you need from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, please consider speaking to a specialist who can help you more fully."
What can cause periods to stop?,"First, it sounds like you already thought of the most obvious answer: pregnancy. While pregnancy tests are very accurate, it is possible that these can be mistaken, and so it may be worth being tested with the more accurate diagnostic tests available through your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>. In any rate, you should speak with your doctor because it is not normal to have amenorrhea (or cessation of menstruation).

Another common cause in young women is poor nutritional status. Menstruation is a sign that your body is able to become pregnant, and when the nutritional status is poor the body will protect itself by stopping menses so that it can focus all of its abilities and energy on just keeping you healthy. This can be common among high performing female athletes.

If you have had a cessation of your menses for a long period of time, it is important that you speak to your doctor to determine why that may be and what can or should be done. With proper discussion and a physical exam, the answer is usually straight forward and can lead to improved health on your part going forward. Please speak to your doctor in the very near future."
Is there treatment available for pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"I strongly recommend that you discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor. Premenstrual syndrome, and its more severe form premenstrual dysphoric disorder, are very common. Fortunately, there are effective treatments, and you shouldn't have to deal with this all on your own! Your doctor will be able to help. 

For many women with premenstrual syndrome, simple life style changes will be all that are needed to control the mood swings and other symptoms. For example, some women find that watching to make sure they get sufficient sleep can be helpful. For others, regular exercise can be very beneficial. For others, avoiding caffeine or alcohol can make a big difference. 

When simple life style modifications fail to treat the problem, there are also medication therapies. For example, medications that are used to treat depressions - especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class of medications - can be very helpful. For some women, just taking these medications for a short duration during their cycle will do the trick, whereas for others taking them on a daily basis for a prolong period (especially in those with previously undiagnosed <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> or mood problems) may be necessary. 

Please make an appointment to discuss this issue with your doctor. "
When can I have an abortion?,"I would definitely recommend going to see your OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>, if they provide abortion services as soon as possible. If your OB GYN doctor does not provide abortion services directly, then they should be able to refer you to a community clinic, such as a Planned Parenthood clinic, that does. 

It is best to be seen quickly because the range of options that you have available to you changes later in pregnancy. For example, ""medical abortions"" using oral medications to induce termination of the pregnancy are an attractive and safe option, but they typically can only be used if you are less than about 8 weeks into the pregnancy. 

After 8 weeks, most pregnancy terminations are performed surgically, dilating the cervix and extracting the contents of the uterus manually. These surgical procedures are routinely performed up to about 14 weeks of pregnancy, more or less. 

After 14 weeks, you have fewer options, because many providers may not have the skills to perform the procedures. Also, depending on the state you live in, abortion may be prohibited after about 20 weeks or so of the pregnancy. 

In other words, the sooner you go to see your doctor to figure out your options the better. Book an appointment with you OB GYN today."
Will a bipartite placenta necessitate an hysterectomy?,"A bipartite placenta is a relatively rare phenomenon that can occur during pregnancy and can be noted on pre-natal <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>. When it is present, there are several complications that can arise before labor, at labor, and even after delivery of the baby. For this reason, it is important that your friend work closely with her <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> and consider seeing a high-risk obstetrician for further help in the pregnancy. While it is uncommon, it is certainly something that can be managed with the proper help. The reason that there may be a risk of a hysterectomy needing to happen is if the entire placenta (the interface between the mother and the baby that supplies nutrition to the growing child) is not delivered after the baby itself is delivered. When this happens, there can be either severe <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> or the retained placenta can become infected and turn into a serious medical condition. Either one of these can be managed, but if early steps at intervention are unsuccessful, the ultimate treatment may need to be removal of the entire uterus, or a hysterectomy. Please speak with your friend and encourage her to work closely with her obstetrician to ensure a healthy pregnancy and delivery."
Can I eat yoghurt during my pregnancy?,"The topic of what foods to eat during pregnancy is a great one, and you are definitely right that there are a lot of old wives' tales around this issue. For this reason, it is always best to run everything by your regular OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> whenever you have a question. They are definitely used to fielding these questions, and they will be able to take the time to answer whatever questions you might have. 

Generally speaking, there are no specific foods that are particularly dangerous during pregnancy, with the exception of foods that contain stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. It goes without saying, however, that any food that you might have an allergy or strong reaction to should be avoided. 

Additionally, there may be certain types of food that might be more indicated during pregnancy than at other times. For example, pregnant women often suffer from <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>, and eating foods high in iron might be important to stave this off. 

Your OB GYN doctor will know best what any specific nutritional needs you might have during your particular pregnancy. Also, may OB GYN practices will have a <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> on staff who can give you additional advice. Congratulations on your pregnancy. "
Are there risks associated with contact with birds during pregnancy?,"The question of household pets and pregnancy is an important one which comes up a lot early in pregnancy. In general, your wife's OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> is going to be her best resources, and she should always feel that she can call with questions whenever necessary. 

The major concern with pets is that they can sometimes pass an infection to the pregnant woman that can adversely affect the pregnancy. Fortunately, in the case of <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a> birds, this risk is pretty low. There are a few infections that birds can carry, but they tend to be sick at that the time and it is usually pretty obvious. Therefore, as long as the pet bird is up to date with their veterinarian checkups, there should be no problem. Wild birds, on the other hand, can be an issue - for example, pigeons and similar birds frequently transmit a fungal infection, called histoplasmosis, in their feces. Avoiding contained environments where there are a lot of bird feces is therefore a good idea. 

Your wife should also talk with her OB GYN doctor about other pet issues. For example, cats are known to transmit toxoplasmosis, which is which pregnant women should stay away from cat fecal material."
How does the pill work?,"I recommend that you discuss your various options with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB GYN. Put in the simplest terms, the <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">birth control</a> pill (oral contraceptives) works by convincing your body to behave as if it is in some form of pregnancy. The female menstrual cycle and reproductive systems are amazingly regulated systems that provide for regular periods of fertility and allow the female body to create and host a new baby. The amount and subtleties of the hormonal regulation that make that possible are impressive, and birth control pills help to adjust these systems. In a usual menstrual cycle, there are periods of preparing an egg for fertilization, periods for fertilizing the egg, and the periods of possible <a href=""/procedure/implantation-of-fertilized-egg-s-1287"">implantation</a> of the fertilized egg, if there is one. At the end of the cycle, the lining of the uterus will slough off (the bleeding that comes at the end of a cycle) and the whole thing will begin again.

In order to prevent pregnancy, the different pills work on either the lining of the uterus, the release of the egg, the thickening of the cervical mucus, or other factors. All of these are natural changes that your body would undergo during a part of your cycle or pregnancy, but the pill tries to maintain them at different times than would usually occur. You should definitely speak to your doctor to see if this is right for you, and what kinds of other options may be available. Book an appointment today!"
What does it mean to have sugar in your urine during pregnancy?,"Sugar in the urine is not a normal finding, and can be suggestive of gestational diabetes. I recommend you speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB GYN immediately! Gestational diabetes can lead to many consequences, which you should be aware of so that you can take the necessary steps to keep both you and your baby healthy.

Sugar in the urine will usually come when the normal urinary filtering functions (that help to keep the blood clean and the body's wastes disposed of) are overwhelmed and the sugar starts to spill into the urine. When this happens, the sugar will draw the water out of the blood and the total volume of urine will increase. That is why people with early diabetes will often feel dry, thirsty, and that they have to urinate quite frequently. 

The extra sugar that can be in your blood (and likely is if some of it is spilling into your urine) can cause your baby to grow faster than it should. Mothers who have gestational diabetes will often have larger than normal babies. Additionally, the strain of the extra sugar can be hard on the pancreas of a little newborn as well. While there are many other potential problems, they can all be treated with appropriate prenatal care and nutrition. Please book an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can!"
How successful is reversal of female sterilisation?,"Sterilization through tubal ligation is a common procedure. This is a minor surgical procedure in which the fallopian tubes that run from the ovaries to the uterus are tied or cut so that the eggs can no longer travel down the fallopian tubes and enter the uterus. 

For all intents and purposes, sterilization through tubal ligation should be considered a permanent procedure. In other words, if you are potentially interested in getting pregnant again later in life, then this is not a good option for you, and you should talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor about alternative methods for preventing pregnancy. 

There certainly are cases in which tubal ligations are reversed, using techniques similar to those used to treat infertility in women with scarring in their fallopian tubes. However, these techniques are complex and are variably successful. The success of the reversal does depend somewhat on the exact technique that was used to perform the ligation in the first place, but in any case success is never guaranteed. 

Your doctor will be able to discuss at length with you the other options for <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">contraception</a> other than tubal ligation that are available to you, many of which are excellent! Book an appointment today!"
Is it possible to be pregnant with a negative pregnancy test?,"Yes, it is possible to be pregnant even though you have had a negative pregnancy test, so you should definitely consult your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB GYN to be sure! Pregnancy tests will often cite a 99% prediction ratio (meaning at least 1% are wrong, right?), but those numbers are based on some assumptions. First, if your test is taken before you would normally have had your menstrual cycle, it is possible that the hormone levels are not high enough. Also, if your cycle is irregular, that can make it difficult to predict at what point you did get pregnant, and can thus throw off a pregnancy test. For most people, however, who are following the instructions on the box or are at the time of their next period, these tests are highly accurate. 

The test that your doctor can do in his or her office is much more accurate at determining if you are pregnant, and if you have concerns, you should speak with your doctor to determine if you should be tested in a more accurate matter. Regardless, if you are a female of child bearing age, you should use proper <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">contraception</a> (and protection!) or consider appropriate prenatal care, such as a multivitamin or other healthy steps such as avoiding alcohol or tobacco smoke. Please book an appointment with your doctor immediately!"
Does spina bifida affect your ability to have a child?,"This is a discussion that you should definitely have with your OB GYN <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> before deciding to proceed. Many women with a personal history of spinal bifida are able to successfully conceive and have children. 

The first thing that you will have to discuss with your doctor is the fact that you will be at somewhat higher risk of having a baby with spinal bifida itself than a woman without your medical history. However, some of this risk can be mitigated by taking high doses of folic acid before conception and during the pregnancy, and your doctor can discuss with you how this is done. 

The second thing you will have to discuss is any residual medical problems or physical limitations you might have yourself from your own spinal bifida. Sometimes, these problems can require special care or accommodations during the pregnancy, and your doctor will be able to outline these details for you. 

The bottom line is that many women with a history of spinal bifida go on to have perfectly healthy babies themselves, but that the pregnancy requires more planning, coordination, and close medical care than would normally be necessary in a pregnancy. 

Talk with your OB GYN doctor at your earliest convenience."
Can I get the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy?,"The question of which vaccines are safe during pregnancy is a very important one, and you should discuss it with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a>. Pregnant women are at high risk of becoming very sick with certain infections if they contract them during pregnancy, especially influenza. Also, unimmunized women may pass certain infections either to the developing baby or to the newborn after delivery. 

However, at the same time, some vaccinations are not safe during pregnancy because they may cause harm to the developing baby. Therefore, it is always important to discuss the safety and necessity of each vaccine with your regular OB GYN doctor before proceeding. 

Tdap is a vaccine which boosts immunity to three infections, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. This vaccine is ""inactivated"" in that it doesn't contain any living organisms that cause the three types of infections. As such, it is safe during pregnancy and, in fact, it is recommended that all pregnant women receive this vaccines after the 20th week of pregnancy. Inactivated influenza is another vaccine that is strongly recommended in pregnant women. 

On the other hand ""live"" vaccines should typically be given before or after pregnancy, but not during the pregnancy, because of the risks the may cause to the developing baby. 

Talk to your OB GYN doctor for more information about this issue. "
What could cause lower abdominal pain and pressure?,"There are many different things that can cause abdominal discomfort, and the best way to help figure out what might be causing your symptoms is to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can get more details about your discomfort and medical history and then examine you to help get you feeling better.  

Overall, it is often helpful to think about the causes of abdominal pain relative to its location.  In a young woman, the ovaries or uterus can sometimes cause abdominal pain (ovarian cysts, menstrual cramping, sexually transmitted infections including pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and pregnancy).  Your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> will likely want to ask about your menstrual history and whether or not you are sexually active.  Bladder or kidney problems (cystitis, infections, and stones) can also cause pain in the abdomen, with symptoms often being aggravated by urination.  Finally, conditions affecting the intestines (infections, irritable bowel disease, <a href=""/procedure/irritable-bowel-syndrome-1294"">irritable bowel syndrome</a>, celiac disease, diverticulitis, and constipation) can also cause pain or pressure in the lower abdomen.  It will be helpful for your doctor to hear more about any other associated symptom such as fevers, travel, association of the pain with eating or certain foods, or any changes in bowel habits.

Hopefully meeting with your doctor will help suggest a more specific diagnosis for your symptoms so you can be back to your normal self soon! Book an appointment today!"
Can Zithromax/Azithromycin affect my birth control?,"This is an important question, because it is definitely the case that many antibiotics interact with <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">birth control</a> pills. Most of the time, they do this by increasing the rate at which the birth control hormones are metabolized in the blood stream, which can make the birth control pills less effective at preventing pregnancy. For this reason, many doctors will recommend using a back up form of birth control (such as condoms) while you are taking birth control pills. Azithromycin is not one of the antibiotics that is most likely to cause this interaction, but you should still check with your <a href=""/obgyns"">doctor</a> nevertheless to get their opinion. 

For the same reason, some women may notice slight changes in their menstrual cycles (such as number of days,  or heaviness of flow) after they have taken antibiotics. This is, again, due to small interactions between the birth control pill and the antibiotic. 

Again, please check in with your doctor for his or her opinion. You should also definitely touch base with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if your period does start normally like it should now that you are taking your placebo pills in your birth control pack. "
I am a pregnant woman; why am I having problems moving my arms?,"Given the fact that you are young and it sounds relatively healthy, the likelihood that this is something serious is pretty low. Nevertheless, you are right to want to get it checked out and I would recommend that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor as soon as the weekend is over. 

The most likely scenario is that you over-exercised, and in that setting are experiencing some muscle soreness and fatigue, which is being amplified by the fact that you are also pregnant. While you are waiting to see your doctor, make sure to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. 

If you develop any worsening symptoms, such as worsening fatigue or <a href=""/procedure/muscle-pain-1024"">muscle pain</a>, then you could go to an emergency room for a more immediate evaluation. You should definitely go to an emergency room if you develop any shortness of great, chest pain, palpitations, or trouble breathing, as these could be signs of a more serious problem. 

On the other hand, if this remains just as feeling tired and sore, then you will probably be ok getting in to see your doctor as soon as you can next week. "
What causes Pulmonary Embolism/Atrial Thrombus?,"I'm very sorry to hear of the loss of your father.  I hope that your family and friends can support one another during this very difficult time.  From the information you provided and with the report of the medical examiner, it sounds like your father likely developed what is called atrial fibrillation in the week before he passed away.  What he describes as his heart ""beating weird"" was likely the irregular rhythm of atrial fibrillation, which many patients can feel and describe as some sort of unusual sensation or ""funny"" heartbeat.  When the heart does not beat regularly, blood does not move smoothly through heart and it is possible for a blood clot to form on the leaflets of the heart valves.  If one of those clots breaks off of the heart valves, it will travel out of the heart where it can cause life-threatening emboli outside of the heart.  The most common complication of thromboemboli (clots that travel) from atrial fibrillation is actually a stroke when the clots travel out of the heart up the carotid artery and into the brain.  In your father's case, it sounds like the medical examiner believes that a clot may have formed on the right side of the heart and subsequently traveled into the lungs where it caused a fatal pulmonary embolism.  Unfortunately, both a pulmonary embolism and atrial fibrillation can happen to people who are otherwise healthy.  If you have any other questions about the medical examiner's report, you should be able to speak with him or her.  Your father's physician or your physician can also be a resource should you need additional information."
Why do I have a sharp pain right under my sternum which increases when I lean forward?,"If this is a new change in your health, it will be very important for you to have this evaluated right away.  There are many things that can cause chest pain and specifically chest pain that is positional.  Pericarditis or an inflammation in the lining around the heart classically worsens when a patient leans forward.  Sometimes pleuritis, or inflammation of the lining around the lungs, can cause a similar sharp pain, but this is more typically associated with taking a deep breath.  A blood clot which travels to the lungs (known as a pulmonary embolism) is also a very worrisome condition that can cause sharp chest pain.  Patients who smoke can be at increased risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.  Pain under the sternum can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease.  

In order to determine what is causing your symptoms, whether one of those more concerning findings or something more benign, a physician will want to talk with you about the onset of your symptoms; your overall medical history and medications; and perform a physical examination.  In cases of chest pain, an <a href=""/procedure/ecg-ekg-197"">EKG</a> is also a very important diagnostic tool.  If you don't have a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, it may be most appropriate for you to seek evaluation in an urgent care or emergency room."
What is it if someone has a knot on or around their heart?,"I am sorry to hear that your grandmother is having some health problems.  Given her age and medical history it is a very good thing that she is in the Emergency Room for further evaluation.  One of the most concerning causes of chest pain is a heart attack, and older patients as well as those with diabetes are known to have elevated rates of the coronary artery disease that can lead to a heart attack or anginal chest pain.  In order to determine whether this is a problem for your grandmother, the physicians in the ED will want to take a careful look at your grandmother's EKGs as well as check some bloodwork that is associated with heart disease.  In addition, there are many other causes of chest pain that should be excluded in a patient presenting with chest pain.  Other causes of chest pain include musculoskeletal strain, heartburn, inflammation of the lining surrounding the heart or lungs (pleuritis or pericarditis), pulmonary infection such as <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a> or <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a>, valvular heart disease, pulmonary embolism, or a vascular problem such as a dissecting artery.  Some of these things are very serious and others are quite minor.  In order to determine what is going on with your grandmother, she will need to be evaluated further."
Why am I having unexplained chest pain?,"Sorry to hear that you have been struggling with issues relating to <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, and chest pains. It sounds like there is a lot going on, and you definitely will need to talk to a physician to help sort through your symptoms (you are correct in first starting with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> which I think is appropriate in this case). You yourself seem to suggest a couple times in describing your symptoms that anxiety may be playing a role in your problems. This could very well be true. In fact, there are definitely situations in which anxiety can be the root cause of ALL of a patient's symptoms, and can mimic the symptoms of a myocardial infarction (aka 'heart attack'). The problem is that many of the symptoms that you describe are non-specific, meaning that they could be the manifestation of a heart problem, but could be from numerous other things, including anxiety, or reflux. You mention that you have a family history of heart problems, but you are also very young still which typically puts you at a much lower risk of serious heart problems. Part of what your physician will do, is take a more detailed cardiac history which will help better determine cardiac risk factors. For instance, it is important to determine if you had any childhood heart problems, heart surgeries, arrhythmias, etc. Also how old were your family members when they had heart problems? These are all things that a primary care physician can usually work up. It is not unreasonable however to ask your primary care physician to refer you to a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> to be evaluated. Even if they evaluate you and tell you your heart is fine, they can give you lifestyle modifications that will decrease your cardiovascular risk factors over your lifetime. Book an appointment today!"
Is a low protein cardiac diet recommended for a person on coumadin? ,"I recommend your sister speak with her doctor about these diet concerns. A cardiac diet is a type of diet that is prescribed to patients who either have heart disease or have a high risk of developing heart disease. The diet is meant to help control the buildup of cholesterol blockages in the arteries and to moderate the blood pressure. As such, the two main components that are regulated in the cardiac diet are salt content and fat and cholesterol content. The cardiac diet doesn't specifically restrict protein, although of course high-fat proteins would be limited. 

This cardiac diet issue is separate from the coumadin diet. Coumadin is a blood thinner that works by inhibiting the action of vitamin K in the body. Therefore, if a person ingests large amounts of vitamin K, this will make the coumadin less effective. Persons who are taking coumadin, therefore, have to watch their intake of foods high in vitamin K. There are many of these foods, but some of the most common include liver as well as numerous ""leafy green vegetables"" like lettuce, spinach, broccoli, and cabbage. 

Your sister should talk with her <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>, <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a> if she has any specific questions about how to make sure that she is following her diet as prescribed."
What is open heart surgery? ,"These are all excellent questions.  The best thing for you and your family and grandfather to do to make sure that he is prepared for surgery and all that it involves is make sure you have a chance to go over all of your questions with your grandfather's surgeon prior to surgery.  Surgeons will typically have a pre-op visit to go over all of these things and perform an exam to make sure a patient is medically safe to undergo major surgery.  In addition, for open heart surgery, he will also have a pre-op appointment with an <a href=""/anesthesiologists"">anesthesiologist</a> and likely his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>/<a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> for clearance as well.  Each of these physicians can help give you additional information about aspects of his surgery and recovery.

As you indicate, open heart surgery is a relatively major procedure as it involves making a large incision in the center the chest, sawing through the sternum (or breastbone) and 'opening' the rib cage to provide the surgeon access to the heart.  This sounds rather involved--and it is!--and your grandfather will spend several days in the hospital, including the post-surgical intensive care unit for a few days.  He will likely also need to spend time in a rehabilitation facility in between the surgery and going home.  However, the good news is that these kinds of surgeries are routinely done on patients of his age with very good results.  Make sure to consult with the primary care physician or cardiologist if you have any further concerns."
What is an atrial septal aneurysm? ,"This is a question for your husband to discuss with his <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>. An atrial septal aneurysm is a very common abnormality in which part of the wall separating the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria) bulges outward in an unusual way. You are definitely correct that this abnormality is often found in people who have had strokes. However, it is also very commonly found in people who have never had strokes and in fact never go on to have strokes either. Often times, it is found ""incidentally"" when an <a href=""/procedure/echocardiogram-196"">echocardiogram</a> (ultrasound) of the heart is performed for another reason. 

Many people with an atrial septal aneurysm will also have a small communication (blood flow) between the two atria. For this reason, sometimes an additional study, referred to as a ""bubble study"", which is a special type of echocardiogram, may be performed to rule this out. 

The exact treatment of an atrial septal defect depends a lot on the opinion of your husband's cardiologist and his overall health. 

For example, if your husband has already had a stroke, then <a href=""/procedure/blood-thinning-therapy-anticoagulation-1122"">anticoagulation</a> with blood thinners may be indicated to prevent another stroke. Alternatively, if there is a small communication of blood flow found between the two atria, then sometimes this will be closed with a small device. 

On the other hand, if your husband is entirely well, his cardiologist may just choose to watch this closely. 

Again, he should talk with his cardiologist. Best of luck."
What is thickening of the heart?,"I can't say exactly with certainty what this means without more information, but it sounds to me like your father most likely had either an electrocardiogram (electrical tracing of the heart) or echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) which showed left ventricular hypertrophy. 

Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common condition in which the muscle that forms the wall of the left ventricle (the biggest chamber in the heart) becomes thickened. This is usually due to chronic high blood pressure. Just like any other muscle, when made to work hard, the heart will get bigger, and having blood pressure elevated over the years will lead to a larger heart muscle than if the blood pressure was not elevated. 

Your father will have to work with either his <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or his <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> to help figure out what additional treatments or workup are needed at this point. In the setting of chest pains, for example, it is pretty common to get a stress test to rule out more serious heart disease, and his doctors may want to do this if they have not done so already. Similarly, they will definitely want to work on controlling his blood pressure if that is an unresolved issue. Good luck."
What causes Atherosclerosis?,"First of all, it sounds like you are making excellent decisions for your health after your recent heart attack. Hopefully this will help you remain healthy for years to come.  Your question is an excellent one, and you are very much correct that there is a connection. You should definitely discuss your concerns with your <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>.

A heart attack is the most dreaded complication of atherosclerosis, and for the vast majority of patients, especially those at your age, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the underlying cause of heart attacks.  In simple terms, atherosclerosis is a buildup of plaque on the inside walls of any artery, including the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart.  When one of these plaques accumulates to the point that it blocks blood flow, the heart muscle downstream of the blockage does not get enough blood or oxygen, sometimes causing a heart attack. In addition, sometimes plaques that don't completely block an artery can rupture, spilling their contents into the blood vessel space and causing a blockage. Finally, a partially obstructing plaque can also serve as the foundation for a blood clot that can also cause a blockage. Cholesterol is a principle component of the atherosclerotic plaques, so even though you have been watching your diet and exercise in the last year, atherosclerosis is a condition that builds up over years and years, including the decades prior to your heart attack.

Any further questions you have can undoubtedly be answered by your cardiologist.  It is very important to follow his or her recommendations to help preserve your heart function now that you have recovered so well and are motivated to improve your health habits!"
how long does a pacemaker with defibrillator batteries last?,"Pacemaker devices alone have much longer battery life than devices that also include a defibrillator component. This is because the defibrillator uses a lot more energy than the pacemaker component. This is especially the case if you have ever been ""shocked"" by your defibrillator, as the shock uses quite a bit of energy. Equipment malfunction, such as cracking in the electrical leads that feed into the device, can also drain the battery energy more rapidly than expected. Taken all together, therefore, it is possible that you need to replace your battery after just three years. This is part of the reason that your <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> has been regularly monitoring your device, so that they can let you know when it is time to set up a replacement. 

I would recommend setting up a visit with the cardiologist who implanted the device to talk about your options. They will be able to describe in more detail what replacing the battery of your device entails and answer any specific questions you might have, such as what restrictions you will have on activity after getting the device replaced, how long you will have to be in the hospital, and so on. Book an appointment your cardiologist today!"
Is it generally safe to take Clonidine?,"This is a very difficult question to answer, as there are many details that need to be considered. First of all, how do you have access to so many medications? In general, the correct answer would be to take the medication as prescribed by your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a>, and discuss any concerns you have with him or her.

All of those medications could be completely appropriate, or any single one of them could be a horrible choice. It all depends on why your heart can't go over that rate, what the test is, what allergies you have, what medical history you have, and what all of these are about. Clonidine will have to reduce your heart rate and make you feel more relaxed in many instances. Calcium channel blockers like nifedipine can also help with your heart rate, although neither is as commonly prescribed for rate control as are other medications such as beta blockers (a common example of a beta blocker would be Lopressor, or metoprolol). Amlodipine would be less likely to control your heart rate than the others. Please, speak with your doctor to determine what is best med for you to take. Book an appointment today."
16 yr old female collapsed after cross country race - why?,"There are so many different possible causes of what happened to your daughter. However, the bottom line is that she needs to be evaluated by her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> as soon as possible. Also, she shouldn't run again until this evaluation is complete. 

I know that sounds quite harsh, but it is absolutely critical to rule out a heart problem as the cause of her symptoms. Extreme physical exercise often unmasks heart problems in young athletes, some of which can be fatal if they are not detected. Fortunately, these problems are rare, but they must be ruled out. Your daughter's <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> will start by asking detailed questions about the accident. They will also perform a careful cardiac examination, and they will probably want to get an electrocardiogram (electrical tracing of the heart). If these turn up anything concerning, then your daughter may need an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the heart (echocardiogram) or Holter monitor/event monitor (portable electrocardiogram that she wears around the clock for a few days). 

If this evaluation is normal, then your daughter's doctor will be able to counsel you on other possible causes, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances. 

Make an appointment with your pediatrician right away!"
Chest pains - why?,"There is a broad list of conditions which can case chest pain, some of which are related to the heart itself and others of which are not.  From what you've described, it sounds like your physician had an idea as to what might have been causing your symptoms.  However, if you are still having chest pain it is important for you to let your physician know this right away.  He or she might want to see you again immediately in the office, or, depending on what your symptoms are, he might want you to be seen for immediate evaluation in an emergency room.  Chest pain is a symptom that should never be taken lightly.

The chest pain that you describe after eating could well be related to <a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">acid reflux</a>, or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).  This occurs when acidic contents from the stomach 'back-up' into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation in the center of the chest that can be very uncomfortable.  There are several things you can do to prevent these symptoms.  First, you should avoid eating before bed. Next, you should avoid spicy, acidic, or caffeinated foods and beverages. Finally, your physician may want to prescribe a medication that lowers acid production in the stomach.  Hopefully you will be feeing better soon.  However, in the short-term, it is very important that you contact your physician's office right away to discuss your symptoms of chest pain to make sure that more urgent intervention is not needed."
Am I experiencing panic attacks?,"I'm sorry that you are having these symptoms as they do sound pretty distressing. I think that you are going to need to find a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to provide you advice or go back to an emergency room or urgent care sent as soon as possible for additional evaluation. 

All of your symptoms still could be GERD, especially given that the symptom of discomfort tend to be at night (presumably when you are relaxing or laying down), which is classic for GERD symptoms. 

However, the sensation of rapid heart beat is concerning to me, as this could be a sign of a heart problem and not just GERD. Therefore, ruling out a heart problem, which a primary care doctor or the emergency room should be able to do, would be the first priority. 

Panic attacks or <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> are also a possibility. However, unfortunately, panic attacks are a diagnosis of exclusion. This means it is important first to rule out other, more immediately serious, causes, which will require input from a doctor. 

When you are seen,  the doctor will likely want to perform an electrocardiogram as well as, potentially, some basic blood work. Based on results, the doctor will be able to advise you about what to do next. "
I fainted for no reason - why?,"There are many different causes of <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a>. The fact that you felt cold and clammy and hot spots in front of your eyes suggest that the most likely cause of the fainting in your case was a vaso vagal reaction, which occurs when the blood suddenly pools in the feet. This can occur with prolonged standing (not sure how long you were standing in line, for example), with stress, and with dehydration. 

However, it is impossible to rule out a more serious cause of fainting based solely on this history. Other more serious causes of fainting would include a problem with your heart rhythm or other types of heart disease. Therefore, it is generally advisable to schedule a follow up with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> after any episode like this. They can examine you from head to toe and determine whether any additional testing is needed. If the exam is totally normal, then they might concur that this was just a vaso vagal episode and that no additional testing is needed. 

In the meantime, if you experience any palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, or recurrent fainting, go right to the emergency room for evaluation, and don't wait to get in to see your doctor for an office visit. "
Heart spasms - what causes them?,"These symptoms are very concerning. Your father has a very significant history of heart disease, and we know that he already has very bad narrowing of his coronary arteries. Therefore, any heart related symptoms, such as pain or spasms could be a sign that that narrowing is getting worse and that he is not having good blood flow to his heart muscle. 

Therefore, I think it is very critical that he gets in to see his <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> immediately for an evaluation. If he cannot get in right away to see his cardiologist, then it would be appropriate to go to an emergency room for a more rapid evaluation. 

His cardiologist will want to run some tests, including an electrocardiogram and some bloodwork, looking for any evidence of a heart attack. Even if those tests are negative, he may need a repeat <a href=""/procedure/cardiac-catheterization-1303"">cardiac catheterization</a> to look at the flow of blood in his coronary arteries and determine whether or not he needs another intervention (like a stent) to open them back up. 

The important message is that it is critical for him not to wait and see what happens, but rather to seek medical evaluation as soon as is humanly possible. "
I'm 20 years old and the left side of my chest hurts when I work out?,"Please go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It is generally recommended to go see your primary care doctor at least once a year anyway, especially if you are having symptoms such as the ones you describe. 

In an otherwise healthy 20 year old, it is pretty unlikely that the chest pain you are experiencing represents a serious problem. However, it is important nevertheless to rule out a heart problem, and your doctor will be able to do this with a physical examination. If they turn anything up on the examination they may also want to perform some additional testing. 

Assuming that this is not a heart related problem, then there are a few other possibilities. The most likely is that you are experiencing <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a> or fatigue from the type of exercise you are performing. This can usually be fixed by reducing the intensity of the exercise or changing the type of the exercise. 

Side splints are another possibility, as these can sometimes cause significant enough pain that they feel like chest pain. Again, side splints don't require specific treatment, other than reducing the intensity of your workouts. 

Make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as you can!"
Could Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome skip a generation?,"Wolf Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome, as you know most likely, is a condition in which a rhythm problem can develop in the heart that can lead to palpitations and, occasionally, death as occurred in your grandfather's case. 

WPW is a relatively common heart condition, affecting approximately 1 in 1000 people. However, almost all cases of WPW are not genetically inherited. A small subset of cases of WPW are inherited; however, these cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that they occur in every generation and do not skip generations. 

Nevertheless, I do suggest that you talk with both your own <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> and also with your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about your personal heart history and also your family history of WPW. They will be able to help you figure out whether or not this is something that you need to worry about in your son's future. For example, they can help you decide whether your son requires any special testing at this time, or whether he might in the future. They can also help you make decisions about whether he should be allowed to participate in sports as he grows up. 

Again, please talk to your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctors</a>, who will be able to answer your questions."
Why do I get heart palpitations even though the cardiologist saw nothing wrong?,"This is a discussion you should have with your doctors. On the whole I think that the results of all of the diagnostic tests that you have done are probably great news. Generally speaking, when a heart test and stress test are normal, the likelihood that palpitations are related to a real heart problem is quite low. However, it is possible to have an intermittent rhythm problem with the heart that may not be picked up on the stress test but that might still be occurring at random times throughout your day. For this reason, some <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologists</a> may want to send you home with a home heart monitor to try to capture these events. This monitor is called either a ""Holter monitor"" or an ""event monitor."" 

Assuming that all of these studies turn out normal, then you will need to follow up with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>, because anxiety or panic attacks can also be a common cause of palpitations. If this is what is contributing to your palpitations, then treating your anxiety symptoms more aggressively will be helpful. Again, please continue to discuss this issue with your doctors."
Why am I having palpitations?,"There are a variety of different causes of palpitations, some of which are benign and some of which can be more serious. If you have been on medications for your palpitations for 15 years, then your doctors have most likely diagnosed you with a benign type of irregular rhythm (ie, arrythmia) causing your palpitations. Unfortunately, even these ""benign"" types of arrhythmia can be bothersome to a patient, prompting escalation in therapy. 

Arrythmias can be triggered by different situations, such as stress, ischemia (lack of oxygen in the heart), alcohol, excess thyroid hormone, drugs and medications, and surges in adrenaline. This last scenario may include something like <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, in which the body up-regulates its stress hormones to accommodate the procedure.

If you have been experiencing palpitations and a racing heart since the surgery, then you should consult with your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> immediately. An electrocardiogram (<a href=""/procedure/ecg-ekg-197"">ECG</a>) can be performed to document the rhythm that you are experiencing, which can help determine the best way to treat you. If your heart ""jumped"" into this rhythm as a result of the surgery, then you may need another form of treatment to break the irregular rhythm. This may include intravenous or new oral medication, or even an electrical cardioversion to ""shock"" the heart back into a normal rhythm. See a doctor as soon as possible!"
What does it mean if my heart skips a beat sometimes?,"Feeling like your heart is skipping a beat is a very common medical problem. Most of the time, this is due to something known as a 'premature beat' which, as long as it does not occur too often, is not usually a serious medical problem. In most otherwise healthy people, premature beats are associated with stress, fatigue, and caffeine intake and smoking, so working on those things might help to reduce the symptoms. 

Also, you should definitely mention the issue to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, as sometimes skipped beats can be a sign of a more serious heart problem, especially if you are older or if you have other risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes, <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, or a strong family history. They will be able to examine you closely and make sure there is nothing serious going on. 

Also, if you experience any other more concerning symptoms, which would include things like shortness of breath, <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, fainting, palpitations, or swelling in your legs, those are all more likely to be associated with a serious heart problem, and they would be reasons for you to get in to see your doctor immediately. 

Talk to your doctor right away!"
Should I be careful about medications if I have mitral valve prolapse?,"The mitral valve is a valve that separates the two chambers in the left side of the heart. Sometimes the valve is a bit ""floppy"" and bulges upwards when the heart contracts. This bulging can sometimes be heard with a stethoscope, and it is called ""mitral valve prolapse."" 

Mitral valve prolapse is very common and, in most people, it is not really a medical problem at all and does not require any treatment. In some cases, mitral valve prolapse may progress to mitral valve regurgitation, which may require treatment if it is severe. 

What you should do discuss this issue with your <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. Your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> can listen to your heart and make sure you have not developed this more significant problem. And as always, it is a good idea to ask your doctor's advice any time you are about to start any new medication. Please talk to your doctor soon!"
Is stress giving me chest pains?,"Chest pain can be caused by many different things, many of which are not serious but some of which are. Therefore, any recurrent chest pain needs to be evaluated by a <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> to make sure it is not serious. I suggest that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for help with this. 

Stress and fatigue can cause a number of physical symptoms. In some people this include occasional twinges of chest pain (potentially related to heart burn). However, I wouldn't assume that the chest pains are from stress until other things have been ruled out. 

When you go to see your doctor, at the top of their list will be making sure your chest pains are not from a heart condition, which is the most serious possibility. Make sure to mention to them if the chest pains are associated with exercise and whether or not there are any other symptoms like sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> or fainting, or palpitations. Also mention any family history of heart conditions. 

These data will help your doctor determine if you need further testing, which might include basic blood work and an electrocardiogram or stress test, depending on how concerned they are. "
Is a small blockage in your heart a cause for concern?,"A blockage in the blood vessels that serve the heart (which is what I think you mean by a blockage in your hear) is something that is common, but serious and should be taken very seriously.  If they get large and serious, these blockages are the source of heart attacks, heart failure, and chest pain.  In order to make the statement that you have a blockage in your heart, you would have had to undergo either a <a href=""/procedure/nuclear-stress-test-199"">nuclear stress test</a> or a <a href=""/procedure/cardiac-catheterization-1303"">cardiac catheterization</a>.  If you have not undergone either of these tests, then it cannot be determined that you have a blockage.  Assuming you have had one or both of these tests, then you will need to pay close attention to your life style, and take certain medications for most of your life.  The life style issues are that you need to eat more vegetables, eat less meat, eat less salt, and exercise more.  The medications that you will need to be on include most importantly a statin (examples include atorvastatin and rosuvastatin).  If you are on this medication, and you are doing your best at improving your life style, then you stand a good chance to avoid heart issues in the future.  In addition, if you do have a blockage, you should schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> for further workup and instructions.  Good luck.  "
Why do I get random chest pains?,"You definitely need to get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. Although there are many benign causes of chest pain, in someone your age, heart disease starts being a big possibility, so it is really important to get that evaluated right away!

When you go to see your doctor, they will listen to your heart to see if they can detect anything obvious. You should also tell them what brings the pain on (for example, do the pains occur at rest or only with exercise) and what makes them better, as well as any other associated symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, nausea). 

After this, your doctor will probably want to obtain an electrocardiogram, or electrical tracing of the heart, which is a simple office procedure. They may also want to get some basic bloodwork. If they have any concern that this might be heart disease, then they will probably want you to have a stress test to further evaluate for heart-related causes of your chest pain. 

Assuming all of those tests check out ok, then your doctor will also consider other potential causes of your chest pain that are less serious, such as chronic heartburn. 

Go see your doctor right away!"
Is it dangerous if your heart sort of flutters?,"The likelihood that this is a serious problem depends a lot on your risk factors. For example, in otherwise healthy young people, this is most likely just premature contractions of the heart, that can be brought out by stress, fatigue, or caffeine but that are not usually very serious. However, in an older person, someone with multiple medical problems, or someone with a history of heart disease in the family, there is a stronger likelihood that this could be a more serious rhythm problem in the heart. 

My suggestion is always that every person who experience fluttering of the heart should be evaluated by their <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. They can examine you for signs of heart disease and perform an electrocardiogram to see if there is evidence of a rhythm disturbance. 

Make sure to mention to your doctor if you have any other concerning symptoms, such as history of <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a> or <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, shortness of breath, or chest pain, as these are important warning signs. 

Based on what your primary care doctor finds, they can help you decide if this is a benign problem or if it is something more serious that requires further workup and treatment. 

Good luck!"
If I have tightness in my chest could it mean that I have a heart problem?,"Yes, it certainly could mean that you have a heart problem, but it does not necessarily mean that. Without knowing more information about you, including your risk factors, family history, and even your social history, it is very difficult to say. If you are young, healthy, and have no significant family history, it is quite possible that your pain is from some involvement of the chest walls. From the symptoms that you are describing, however, I am concerned about your heart and suggest that you see a <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> very soon to make sure you are not at an elevated risk of a heart attack. If you experience chest pain while exercising, please call 911 and take an aspirin. You should see your doctor before you exercise or exert yourself in light of what you have described to determine if you need further testing. There are many options available to determine how healthy your heart is, and any of these will make you feel more comfortable in knowing that you are able to either continue exercising or stop when you feel these pains. While your symptoms could be from something entirely unrelated, without more information, please stop exercising until you speak with your doctor, and speak with your doctor very soon to make sure that you are cleared to continue. "
Can taking aspirin damage your liver?,"Aspirin is a medication that has been shown to be cardioprotective and decreases the incidence of MI (or heart attack). In most cases, taking just a ""baby"" aspirin (81 mg dose) daily is sufficient to exert its cardioprotective effects. Aspirin at such a low dose is unlikely to damage any of your other organs. With respect to your liver, Aspirin does not generally have negative effects on the liver. There are other medications, such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) which can cause damage to your liver if you take more than the recommended amount. Taking 3000mg or more of Tylenol (acetaminophen) can cause liver damage. 

With respect to Aspirin and the liver. There is a warning that children shouldn't take aspirin as it may cause Reye's syndrome which can cause fatty liver. This is not a concern in the adult population. 

The key concern with aspirin is that if you have a condition that predisposes you to bleeding then you should speak to your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> (<a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>) before you start on aspirin, to make sure it is safe for you to take it. 

I highly recommend most adults especially over the age of 40 to take 81mg aspirin tablet daily as it has been shown to decrease the risk of stroke and heart attack. 

Talk to your primary care doctor or cardiologist about starting on Aspirin for your heart and to make sure it is safe for you to take Aspirin from the bleeding risk standpoint. It is unlikely to damage your liver or other organs. "
I'm having trouble breathing. What is wrong with me?,"Your problems sound like something that you should have looked into very soon.  I think that you may have a heart arrhythmia.  This is a type of heart problem where the heart beats abnormally fast.  Heart arrhythmias typically come and go, but some of them don't go away.  If your heart rate is too fast, your heart may not be able to pump blood as effectively.  This could be the reason why you feel short of breath and your finger nails turn a bit blue.  It is for these reasons that you should seek care from a <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> right away.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>.  He or she can listen to your symptoms, examine your heart, and get an electrocardiogram of your heart.  If this is abnormal, then your doctor may know what to do next.  If you are feeling fine at the time of your exam, then most likely your electrocardiogram will look fine.  In this case, you may have to wear a heart monitor known as a Holter monitor.  This is a type of device that can detect arrhythmias during times when your heart rate is fast.  In addition, your doctor may want to get an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of your heart to assess its function.  Good luck.  "
Would taking Verapamil cure my chest pains?,"The answer to your question depends on why you are having chest pains.  verapamil is a type of medication that decreases how much work the heart has to do.  By doing this it lowers blood pressure.  Since Verapamil decreases the work load of the heart, it also reduces the amount of oxygen the heart needs to function.  People that have chest pain because of blockages in their coronary arteries develop their pain because the heart tissue is not getting enough blood flow.  Verapamil is a medication that can decrease the amount of blood the heart needs, and increase some flow to the heart muscle through the coronary arteries.  Thus, verapamil may help your chest pain, but only if you have coronary artery disease.

If you do have coronary artery disease, you should consider some of the other more advanced options to help your chest pain.  Today there are stents and surgical options (such as bypass <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>) which are better long term options than verapamil.  These decisions on what is best for you should be made by a specialist.  Therefore, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a>.  The two of you can discuss your symptoms and make a plan to figure out what the best next step is for your chest pain and your overall heart health.  "
Is tachycardia the same thing as irregular heartbeat?,"Tachycardia means specifically a rapid heart rate. It doesn't sound at all like this is what you are dealing with. Rather, it sounds like you notice that sometimes your heart rate is irregular or that, potentially, it sometimes seems to skip a beat. 

In younger adults one common cause of these symptoms are what is called a sinus arrhythmia. Most of the time, this is a this is just a normal variation of the heart beat, and it is not something that needs to be worried about. 

A second common cause is premature beats, which cause the heart to 'skip' periodically. Most of the time premature beats are also not a sign of underlying heart problems, and they can be brought out by stress or by caffeine consumption. On the other hand, sometimes premature beats can be a sign of scarring in the heart or a more serious rhythm problem, although this is uncommon in the otherwise healthy heart. 

In older adults, another additional cause of irregular heart beat is something called atrial fibrillation, which is a chronic rhythm problem in the heart that needs medical treatment to avoid a risk for stroke from blood clot formation. 

Regardless of your age, you should have these symptoms evaluated by either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> to make sure that no additional workup or treatment is needed and to rule out a serious heart problem. "
Why do I feel like my heart stops sometimes?,"You should definitely go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this problem. Any persistent symptoms involving the heart need to be checked out by a doctor to make sure that there is no serious problem going on. 

The most common cause of feeling like your heart stops beating for a quick second are what are known as premature beats. Most healthy people will occasionally have premature beats, and these are often made worse with lots of caffeine consumption, for example coffee or soda or energy drinks. Therefore, if you notice an association between the symptoms and drinking caffeine, you may want to stop or cut down. 

However, there are other more serious heart conditions, especially problems with the electrical rhythm in the heart, that can give similar symptoms. Your doctor will be able to perform an examination of your heart to see if there are any concerning findings. They may also decide to perform an electrocardiogram, which is an electrical tracing of the heart, to see if anything shows up. 

When you go to see your doctor, make sure to mention if you have any other concerning symptoms, especially <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, or <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a>. Also make sure to mention any family history of heart problems. Good luck!"
What is causing my heartbeat to increase?,"The symptoms you are describing are usually referred to as palpitations--the sudden sensation of the heart speeding up or beating irregularly.  Palpitations are relatively common, but it is important to determine whether they are being caused by something benign or whether they are a marker of a more severe underlying heart condition.  For this reason it is best that you see your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> right away.  Depending upon your prior health problems, he or she might want to refer you to a cardiologist.

In particular, it will be important to know if there are any patterns with these changes in your heartbeat. Do you notice this when you are exercising?  When you are stressed?  With a lot of caffeine?  In addition, it is also important to know how long this sensation lasts for; whether it is accompanied by any other symptoms such as shortness of breath or lightheadedness; and then of course a physical exam with particular attention to the cardiac exam will also be a part of the evaluation. Your doctor will want to do an <a href=""/procedure/ecg-ekg-197"">EKG</a> as a preliminary evaluation of the electrical system of your heart.  In addition, depending upon your exam and history, you might be given a special monitor to wear at home to try and record your cardiac activity at home when you experience these palpitations.  "
Are there any ways to tell if someone is going to have heart trouble?,"The danger of heart attacks, is that they may not always have warning signs. Therefore, the most important first step for your mother will be preventing heart attacks and working to protect her health. You should encourage her to see her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who will be able to perform a complete checkup and give her advice. Typically, a primary care doctor will look for any risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol or <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, and they will work with your mother to address any of those problems if they are found. 

Furthermore, the fact that your mother does smoke puts her at much higher risk of heart trouble than if she did not smoke. This is also another issue that she can address with her doctor, who will be able to counsel her on resources and medications that can help her stop smoking. 

If your mother ever complains of trouble breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain, or trouble with exercise, these may all be signs of an impending heart attack. If she experiences these symptoms, she would need to go immediately to an emergency room for rapid evaluation and treatment in order to prevent a heart attack. "
Does fish oil help with cholesterol?,"Fish oil contains an active ingredient called omega 3 fatty acid. This is the key substance that is responsible for its health benefits. Several studies have shown that taking omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) at doses of greater than three grams can reduce elevated triglyceride levels by up to 50%. Omega 3 fatty acids in higher doses inhibit the synthesis of triglycerides. 

So if your triglycerides are indeed elevated, you may certainly benefit from fish oil (omega 3 fatty acid) supplementation. Why do triglycerides matter? Well multiple studies have linked high triglyceride levels to development of cardiovascular disease, meaning that people with high triglycerides are at higher risk for things such as heart attack than with people with normal levels of triglycerides. This is further supported by the observation that people with high fish oil content in their diet had less cardiovascular events than people who had a low intake of fish oil. 

You should discuss the appropriate dosage of fish oil to take with your physician. Things such as smoking cessation and aerobic exercise can also reduce risks of cardiac events. Speak to your <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> regarding your lipid profile and risk factors for heart disease and follow up his or her recommendations to minimize risk factors. "
Is there such thing as a normal heart rate or does it vary for each individual?,"There is not really such a thing as a normal heart rate, since the heart rate is determined by so many different physical factors. For example, elite athletes often have very slow heartrates, sometimes in the range of 30 or 40 beats per minute. On the other hand, normal, reasonably healthy young adults may have average heart rates of 60 to 80 beats per minute. In addition to fitness level, gender and age also factor in to what might be a normal heart rate for you. Many medications, such as common medications for blood pressure control, will also affect the heart rate. 

I would not be concerned by your slow heart rate alone, as it would lead me to think that you are probably more fit than others. However, if you do not exercise regularly and have a very slow heart rate that would be unusual. Also the combination of occasional <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> and slow heart rate might be an indication of a problem with your heart rhythm that might need to be investigated, depending on your age and whether you have any other serious medical problems. 

I recommend that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a good checkup!"
Should I go to the doctor if I fainted?,"It sounds like you had a typical episode of <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a>. This usually occurs when blood starts to pool in the veins of the legs, temporarily interrupting circulation of the blood to the head, and resulting in fainting or <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>. This is called a vasovagal reaction, and it commonly occurs in response to standing for long periods of time, being stressed, extreme heat, dehydration, and fatigue. 

The most important way to prevent vasovagal reactions in the future is to make sure you stay well hydrated and that you don't stand in one place for a long period of time. If you start to feel faint, sit or lay down until the feeling passes. 

One point of consideration would be that, if you have never fainted before, there is some association between the onset of fainting episodes and pregnancy, so if there is any chance of that you may want to perform a pregnancy test. 

Please discuss this episode with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. It is important to make sure this is not a more serious form of fainting, for example related to a heart problem."
Can a heart murmur be fatal?,"A heart murmur is a very common condition. Many people have these -- some of which are serious and require treatment, some of which are minor and even go away on their own. I would recommend that your nephew see his <a href=""/cardiologists"">doctor</a> for further evaluation.

A heart murmur occurs when blood flows in the heart in a turbulent fashion. Normally, blood flows smoothly and quietly, but if there is something that makes the blood turbulent -- a murmur can be heard. The most common cause of a murmur in young people is simply what we call a ""flow murmur."" This means that the heart is just working hard to pump blood that the blood sounds turbulent. This often goes away on its own. Another cause of the abnormal flow is if there is a problem with the valve -- either it is too small or too floppy. This can be a problem and this can require treatment. A third possibility (there are others but these three are the big one) is that there is a small hole in the heart and that blood is flowing in the wrong direction.

If there is a hole in the heart or a severely damaged valve -- this can lead to problems with the heart pumping and can (without treatment) be fatal. 

An <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the heart can often be done to see exactly what is causing the murmur. Again, please talk to his doctor for more information."
What causes mitral valve prolapse?,"Mitral valve prolapse is a relatively common problem with a heart valve. This happens in many people -- and rarely if ever calls problems. That being said -- this occasionally can cause problems that require significant medical intervention. I would recommend you further discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He can further evaluate this and explain what he has mentioned.

The mitral valve is the valve on the left side of the heart between where the blood enters the heart (the atrium) and where the blood is ejected from the heart (the ventricle). The left side of the heart is the important side that pumps blood from the lungs (where it gets oxygen) to the body. Mitral valve prolapse occurs when the valve doesn't close fully and actually bends back onto itself. People are born with this valve problem. This normally has no clinical signifcance -- although there can be some extra heart sounds heart when listening to your heart.

If the mitral valve worsens -- this can develop into mitral regurgitation -- which is when the valve not only bends back onto itself but also allows blood to go the wrong way. This is a problem that can cause irregular heart beats and other problems. If mitral regurgitation is severe, we give antibiotics during procedures as the hope is to not let bacteria ""stick"" to a bad valve.

Please talk to your doctor for more information."
Could my heart murmurs be caused by Wolff Parkinson White syndrome?,"Wolf-Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome is a type of cardiac arrhythmia in which an accessory conduction pathway exists in addition to the normal conduction pathway from the atria to the ventricles. This condition is extremely rare (0.3% in the general population). 

Patients are generally asymptomatic. 

Your feelings of palpitations and dizziness may be caused by an arrhythmia of some sort (there are many), however it could also be caused by anxiety and knowing that you have family members with WPW.  

Either way, I strongly recommend that you see at least your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if not a <a href=""/cardiologists"">cardiologist</a> and undergo some basic testing at the very least. This would include some blood work and an <a href=""/procedure/ecg-ekg-197"">ECG</a> to start. 

WPW is diagnosed easily with an ECG which would show a small, early bump at the beginning of the QRS wave. This is known as the delta wave and is a classic sign of WPW. Other arrhythmias can also be diagnosed using an ECG. If your ECG is normal, but your episodes of palpitations and dizziness come on at certain times throughout the day, you may need to wear a Holter monitor, which is a device that you would have to carry around with you for 24 hours or more that would record the entire day's heart rhythm and this would then be analyzed for any arrhythmias that you may have experienced. 

Please talk to your cardiologist regarding the workup of your palpitations and dizzy spells. This is not something that should be taken lightly and you should certainly have a work up sooner than later. "
Should multivitamin supplements be taken by infants and toddlers?,"Most pediatricians and <a href=""/dietitians-nutritionists"">doctors</a> agree that there is a place for multi-vitamins and food supplements, but that most children eating a healthy and well-rounded diet do not need them. I recommend you discuss this issue with your doctor, as children with special needs or concerns, or problems with eating a normal diet, may need some help.

Most immediately relevant to you, the best thing that you can do for your child's health is to be healthy yourself. You, as a pregnant soon-to-be mother, should be taking a multi-vitamin, however. One of the best things that you can do for your impending arrival is to make sure and take care of your own health. Regular pre-natal care, avoidance of alcohol or tobacco, and adequate nutrition are all a part of appropriate and excellent care, and should continue after birth. Even after your baby is born, taking care of these things will help your child to be well in the future, as a healthy mother is one of the best things a new baby can have. Then, please at least consider breast feeding, as there is a large amount of research demonstrating the value of this. Finally, work closely with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> to make sure that your child is receiving the nutrition that he or she needs as he or she continues to grow."
I suffered from eating disorders for a long time; can I ever have children?,"As with any medical questions, there are many details that need to be clarified before a simple yes or no answer can be given, so you’ll definitely want to discuss your concerns with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB/GYN.

In the vast majority of cases, the answer would be that eating disorders in the past should not prevent being able to have children in the future. The key factor that would determine the answer to that question is whether or not you have been able to change your health behaviors and improve your overall health. Malnutrition that is often caused by anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders can cause long term changes in health. They will often affect the menstrual cycle and other hormonal factors, as well as more long term issues such as bone density. Provided that the deficits and changes can be reversed, having children in the future should be possible.

If you are planning on having children in the future, meeting with your primary care doctor or an OB/GYN would be an important first step, to make sure that you are in optimal medical condition and to answer this question definitively. Please speak to your doctor. Family, psychiatric, or other support in making healthy changes can also be important to make sure that you maintain your health during pregnancy, which can also be a trying time for anyone. Start by booking an appointment today! Good luck!"
Can someone live on a liquid diet for life?,"Generally speaking, it is not recommended to live on liquids alone. Basically, this is because liquid, because it contains water, is not as dense with calories and solid food. As a result, it is often difficult to get enough calories, or the right profile of vitamins and micronutrients, from liquids. In severe cases, such as people who consume large volumes of carbonated beverages with little food, this may result in malnutrition or a vitamin deficiency. 

That being said, there are some people who suffer from a medical condition which requires them to get their nutrition from a liquid source. For example, incapacitated persons who need to be fed through a tube will get their nutrition this way. Also some intestinal or digestive conditions may require liquid nutrition. 

A medical liquid diet is something that requires close supervision by a <a href=""/dietitians-nutritionists"">doctor</a> and is usually managed by a trained <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionist</a>, to make sure the balance of calories, protein, fats, and micronutrients and vitamins is adequate. 

If this is an issue that you are facing, then you should make sure to talk closely with the team of doctors (such as a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a>) and nutritionists who are helping to manage your care. They will be able to answer all of your questions!"
Why am I always tired?,"Especially in your population, there can be many causes of fatigue. There are a few common causes that should be ruled out -- as they are serious and can be treated. I recommend you see your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a>.

The first thing to consider is functional fatigue. This refers to the fact that I am sure you are extremely busy and overworked given your new child. As obvious as it sounds, making sure you get an appropriate amount of rest (at least 8 hrs a day) and eating well is very important. While it is very difficult for new mothers to sleep that long at night, it is important that you sleep during the day as well. Eating well is also important. Keep in mind that if you are breast feeding, your body is using far more energy then normal.

Other medical causes of fatigue are important. One to consider is <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>, or  low blood count. This is common in young women. Have your blood level checked. Another common cause is low thyroid levels, which can occur after pregnancy. Low cortisol (steroid) levels can be caused by a complicated delivery. More rare causes include post partum heart problems. See your doctor.

Post partum <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> is also a very common cause. I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated, however post partum depression cannot be diagnosed without discussing the above causes. Good luck!"
Could my chest pain and shortness of breath be more then just a cold?,"Chest pain and shortness of breath are very concerning symptoms. There are many causes of these symptoms -- but in a young person it is normally is minor cold. That being said, the fact t hat your symptoms have lasted for so long is concerning. I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at once.

The most common cause is viral infection. These infections can cause inflammation of the airways which can cause a cough, runny nose or shortness of breath. Occasionally, these viral infection can spread and persist.

One cause to consider is pericarditis. This can be when the viral inflammation spreads to the lining of the heart. This can be serious if the inflammation is severe and involves the heart muscle itself. See your doctor who can diagnose and treat this.

A bacterial infection cause also cause these symptoms. These would not improve without antibiotics. This is a <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a>. A chest <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> can help diagnose this.

Other causes include a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot) or a heart problem. Heart problems such as abnormal valves are not uncommon in your age group. This requires attention.

I would strongly recommend you see your doctor. A cold should not last this long and the symptoms are concerning. Good luck!"
Why do I have a large bump on the side of my neck at the base of my head?,"In order to answer this question properly, it is important to know whether you are certain that the bump is new or, perhaps, that it has always been there and you have just not noticed it before. 

For example right at the base of the skull where the spine joins in, there is a prominent piece of bone called the external occipital protuberance. This is a normal bone outcropping, and it can be very noticeable if you feel it. However, most of us are not in the habit of closely examining the back of our necks, so when we find this bump it can seem like a new or worrying finding even though it is not. It is especially unlikely that you would have any displaced or broken bone in the next without a history of some accident or trauma and without any pain or discomfort. 

There are, of course, other bumps in the next that do need to be checked out. For example, swollen lymph nodes can occur at the base of the skull, although these tend to be soft and rubbery, not hard and bone-like. Of course if you have any <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> or other concerning symptoms following your recent travels, these should also be checked out. 

You should show the area to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> in order to ensure peace of mind. "
Why do I have pain and redness coming from my pinky (small finger) and adjacent finger on my left hand?,"Pain, redness, and swelling of joints that goes on for any extensive period of time should be investigated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. 

Although limited pain and swelling of a joint can be expected after a trauma to the joint, you do not mention any accident, and the involvement of both hands makes that less likely. Therefore, other possibilities should be investigated. 

Rheumatoid <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> and other inflammatory conditions of the joints would be a possibility. Rheumatoid arthritis often involves the first two joints of the fingers rather than the last one, which seems like what you are experiencing. It also tends to involve multiple joints in multiple sites, so it would be important also to mention to your doctor if you are having any stiffness or pain in other joints other than your hands, such as your knees or elbows, or if you notice any additional swelling. You should also be on the lookout for any <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, rash, or other unusual symptoms as these may be additional clues for your doctor. 

You should also be certain you do not have an infection of the joint, which would usually involve a bright red, warm, and very painful single joint. 

Start by talking to your primary care doctor, who can help you sort out what is going on. "
Why at 23 do I have severe arthritis in my knees?,"This is a tough question to answer.  It is unclear from your question what symptoms you are having.  For example a <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> will want to know if you are having pain, what type of pain, what time of day is it worse, anything make it better, and anything make it worse?  I imagine you are having pain in your knees, which you have equivocated to arthritis.  You are correct in that arthritis in the knees of a 23 year old is quite rare.  For this reason, I am suspicious that your symptoms are probably due to something other than arthritis.  The most common type of persistent knee arthritis in young people is rheumatoid arthritis.  Another cause that is temporary is viral synovitis, an infection of the knee which can cause pain.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can take a detailed history of your symptoms and perform a thorough musculoskeletal exam focusing on your knees.  From there you may get a imaging of your knees (such as an x-ray), and/or and anti-inflammatory drug which can help with the pain.  If anything is seen on the imaging, then you may warrant a referral to an orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>.  "
Why do I have a dull pain on my right side just under my rib cage after I drink alcohol?,"It is important to get this pain checked out. Alcohol when taken in moderation can have health benefits and is not harmful to the body. However, three drinks may be more than recommended for your body size and gender. 

Excessive intake of alcohol can cause inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), which can present with a dull pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen. Other symptoms to look out for would be yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or a light color to the bowel movements. Similarly, alcohol intake can worsen gall bladder sludge or stones, which can also give pain in this area. Other symptoms might be nausea and <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a> or greasy bowel movements with meals. 

Alcohol intake can also be associate with pancreatitis, which can present with severe or more chronic <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> located in the middle of the abdomen, sometimes going to the back. Finally, alcohol can cause gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, which can cause pain and heartburn symptoms. 

I recommended getting checked out as soon as possible by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to determine what might be going on and whether further workup of your pain might be needed. "
What should I do about these cold symptoms?,"Cold symptoms are common. There are many different causes of these symptoms. While most resolve on their own, there are some causes that require medical attention. I would recommend you see your primary <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> as the severity of your symptoms is troubling. In addition, if symptoms last longer than one week, you should see your doctor.

Colds are medically known as medically known as upper respiratory tract infections. There can be many manifestations of similar infections. In general, the throat, nose, upper airways, sinuses and ears are someway connected. Therefore, one process can cause many different. You sound like you are having throat pain and may also have some ear involvement. I would recommend you see your doctor to rule out an <a href=""/procedure/ear-infection-111"">ear infection</a> (otitis media).

There are two major causes -- viruses and bacteria. Viruses are the far more common cause. These often last 4-7 days. Unfortunately there is no treatment for this. Symptom management is the only way to make yourself  feel better. Tylenol for pain and fevers, benadryl for runny nose etc. Talk to your doctor.

The other major cause is bacteria. These require antibiotics. Specifically strep throat is a bacterial cause of throat pain that requires attention.

See your primary doctor."
Did I have an allergic reaction to Vicodin?,"It sounds like you and your stomach really did not agree with Vicodin.  This is not all that uncommon of a reaction to a narcotic pain killer, though your reaction does sound quite pronounced.  Vicodin is a combination medicine that contains the pain killer and <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> reducer acetaminophen (also known as Tylenol) and the narcotic pain killer hydrocodone.  The nausea and vomiting that you experienced does not technically mean that you had an allergy to hydrocodone.  To a <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a>, an allergy means that your immune system had a reaction to the drug which can result (in addition to nausea and vomiting), in <a href=""/procedure/hives-505"">hives</a>, lose blood pressure, and difficulty breathing.  It is likely that you will have similar reactions to other oral narcotic pain killers.  Nevertheless, you should if you are ever in a position that you need to receive IV pain killers, make sure that you let the doctor know that you had this reaction.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with the physician that prescribed you the Vicodin.  Explain the reaction to him or her.  There are other options for pain control that you may tolerate better.  Hopefully, your sinus an dear infection will clear up soon and you won't have to take any more pills.  "
Why do I have constant gastrointestinal problems?,"There are numerous medical causes of this complex of symptoms. Some of these causes are serious and some are not. You should definitely consult your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB GYN doctor as soon as possible to help you sort this out. 

Common causes of these symptoms associated with food would include an inflammation of or stones within your gallbladder. Another common cause of symptoms with food is an <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">ulcer</a> or inflammation of the stomach. If you are experiencing fever, chills, yellowing of the skin or eyes, darkening of the urine, or a dark black color or bright red color to the bowel movements then you should seek more urgent medical attention. 

Irritable bowel syndrome is a benign cause of nausea, bloating, <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, and constipation which is often worsened in times of stress. It is extremely common, especially in women, but it can often be controlled with a variety of lifestyle measures. 

In women your age, another concerning possibility would be ovarian cancer, which often presents with vague symptoms such as abdominal bloating and nausea. 

The best first step, obviously, would be to have a thorough physical examination by your primary care doctor to determine what further workup, if any, is needed. "
"Every morning that I wake up my throat feels swollen, why is this so?","There are several possibilities that could cause this symptom of sore throat/congestion in the mornings. 

One possibility, as you mention, is allergies. Two forms of allergy can cause this, allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies) and sinus trouble. Both cause mucus to drip down the back of the throat chronically. This is especially noticeable at night, and may cause you to have night time cough or to wake up with a sore, congested throat. Other symptoms would include stuffy nose or sinus pressure and <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>. 

Another possibility would be gastroesophageal reflux disease, or heartburn. With heartburn, acid from the stomach washes out of the stomach into the esophagus. When you lay flat, this acid may reach all the way up the the throat causing irritation of the lining of the throat. Other symptoms might include a burning sensation after eating certain foods and a sour taste in the mouth upon awakening. 

All three of these conditions are very common medical problems and they are not usually serious. However, it would be good to know which you have, and a physical examination by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should be able to sort it out. There are numerous excellent medications that your doctor can prescribe to help with these problems as well. "
How to get rid of a scalp infection?,"The treatments that you have been using for a recurrent scalp infection (folliculitis, or infection of the hair shafts) are pretty good. Therefore, I think it is especially important for you to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to figure out what is going on and what treatment is necessary. 

Folliculitis of the scalp can be difficult to treat sometimes, especially in chronic cases. There may be issues of antibiotic resistance of the bacteria causing the infection or a need for a longer course of antibiotics. Your doctor can help you with this decision. 

Furthermore, sometimes what is thought to be a bacterial infection of the scalp turns out to be instead tinea capitis, a fungal infection of the scalp. This is an important distinction, because fungal infections require antifungal medications and will not respond well to regular antibiotics. 

Similarly, sometimes an inflammatory condition of the scalp, known as seborrheic dermatitis, is mistaken for a scalp infection, Seborrheic dermatitis, unlike a scalp infection, is more itchy and scaly. It may respond to dandruff shampoos, steroid creams, and exfoliation. 

As you can see, the first step will be for you to set up an appointment with your doctor and get a definitive diagnosis of what is going on."
Why do I get dizzy and lose my vision when I crouch and then stand back up?,"Passing out or <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> or serious symptoms which should always be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Although the likelihood that what you are experiencing is in fact related to a serious medical condition is low, the possibility does exist. 

The most likely cause of your symptoms is something called vasovagal syncope. Basically this is a condition in which the nerves that control the tone in your blood vessels allow blood to pool excessively in your lower extremities. This means less blood coming back to your heart and brain, and it leads to dizziness and feeling faint. It is worsened by prolonged standing, changing positions quickly, and dehydration. This condition is benign and is just treated by staying hydrated and being careful when you change positions. 

However, whenever there is <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a> or dizziness it is important to rule out a heart condition. Other concerning symptoms would be chest pain, a feeling like your heart is racing, or dizziness or shortness of breath with exercise. Your primary care doctor will perform a thorough physical examination to make sure there are no signs of heart disease. They may also decide to perform other testing, such as an electrocardiogram or an ultrasound of the heart if they find anything suspicious on the physical examination. "
What would be the cause of an occasional dull pain in the right side of my crotch traveling down my thigh a little an up into my abdomen?,"There are a few possible causes of this type of pain. 

One would be an inguinal <a href=""/procedure/hernia-1065"">hernia</a>. A hernia occurs when abdominal contents (fat or intestines) bulge through a defect in the abdominal wall, usually in a downward direction toward the scrotum. If the hernia is large, you should notice a bulge in or above the right side of your scrotum when you are lifting heavy weights or bearing down. However, if the hernia is small you might not notice this, but you might nevertheless experience intermittent discomfort just like you describe, especially with activity. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> should be able to determine whether or not you have a hernia with a simple physical examination. 

Another possibility would simply be muscle sprain or strain, which can occur with physical activity. This should be a soreness closely associated with exercise and usually occurring more in the muscles of the thigh and less experienced as pain in the scrotum or pubic area. 

There are rare, serious causes of groin pain as well. For example, a testicular torsion, or twisting of the testicle, is very serious, but usually presents as severe, sudden pain and would not come and go in the mild fashion that you describe. 

You should see your primary care doctor to evaluate this symptom. "
Why are my eyes so dry and scratchy when I wake up in the morning?,"The most likely possibility in this setting, of red and dry and itching eyes that comes and goes over a long period of time, is something called allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the eyes that is provoked by an allergy to some substance in the environment. 

The fact that the symptoms seem worse in the morning strongly suggests that the thing you are allergic to is something found in that environment. Common allergies that would be encountered mostly while asleep or in bed include mites (which live in the mattress and in the carpet). 

Mattress covers can be very helpful in this setting, as they trap the allergens inside the mattress and don't allow them to get out and irritate your eyes. Also, if you have carpet or other possible sources of mites or mold in the bedroom these may need to be removed. 

You should also talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. In addition to preventive measure such as mattress covers, certain medications can be helpful. Sometimes, anti-allergic eye drops can do the trick, but other times an oral antihistamine (such as loratidine) can be helpful to prevent symptoms. Your doctor can help you make this decision. "
"I noticed that at night that my skin feels like its itching and things are crawling on me, can you tell me what this is?","Itching, or pruritis, is a common condition. I think there are a couple of common causes -- all of which require attention. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to further evaluate potential causes and treatments.

Firstly, it is possible to have a skin infestation that causes itching. Bed bugs are a popular cause of this recently, especially in New York City. These are small tics that can infect one's bedding and subsequently cause symptoms. This requires pesticides. Other skin infections like scabies are also possible. This is important to rule out (though unlikely if only at night). Dogs can also carry tics which can infect humans.

More specifically, the sensation of crawling insects (without actually there being insects) on your skin is called formication. There are a few causes but the one that is most common is alcohol withdrawal. This is important is means someone is close to <a href=""/procedure/seizures-epilepsy-229"">seizures</a> from alcohol withdrawal -- a deadly situation. 

There are other causes of skin itching that are important. Common ones include thyroid problems (specifically hypothyroid -- which also gives constipation, feeling cold, tired), liver problems (sometime with yellowing of the skin). Dry skin is the most common cause -- in which the skin is scaly and falls off.

Talk to your primary care doctor as soon as possible. This requires attention."
What are the chances of getting genital herpes from your partner during asymptomatic times?,"Herpes is a virus that is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Type 2 herpes virus is more commonly the cause of genital sores, but type 1 herpes (classically the cause of 'cold sores' around the mouth) can cause them also. 

The only way to contract a herpes infection is to come into contact with active blisters or sores that are shedding the herpes virus. This means that essentially there is no risk of contracting the virus when there are no active blisters. However, sometimes it is difficult to be sure that there are no active sores, so many people are infected with the herpes virus when they have unprotected sex because they have not noticed a small sore. 

Using a condom will greatly reduce your risk of contracting herpes. However, it does not reduce your risk to zero, because sometimes the herpes sores occur outside the actual genitalia and you may contract the virus if you come into contact with these sores in areas not covered by the condom. 

The other thing to remember is that herpes virus infections often recur, so just because the sores have healed now does not mean they could not return at a later date.

"My forearm has ached since it fell asleep while resting the other day, how long will this last?","I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> (your GP). If you need an urgent or scheduled appointment depends on a few things...see below.

In general, forearm pain can be caused by a few conditions. Nerve problems are very common. Nerve problems can occur from compression of a nerve. For example, sleeping on the nerve (known as Saturday night <a href=""/procedure/weakness-palsy-227"">palsy</a>) can cause arm numbness and weakness. This normally resolves over 12-24 hours. However, if there is any weakness or clumsiness associated with the arm, then this is more worrisome and warrants urgent evaluation.

Other causes of forearm pain are possible. Muscle sprain or strains are possible. These normally are worse with movement and should improve with ibuprofen. Rarely, a tiny bone fracture can occur that causes similar pain. Another cause is a blood clot in the veins of the arm. This is normally associated with swelling. 

You should certainly see your doctor. The arm pain requires evaluation as, as I am sure you are aware, the arm is an important and complex tool. Any derangement can lead to long term malfunctioning.

If you have any associated weakness, clumsiness, <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, fevers, shortness of breath or chest pain you should see your doctor immediately. Good luck."
I noticed a lentil-sized firm lump under my skin underneath my right ear. ,"This is most likely a lymph node. There are multiple lymph nodes in this region of the body (called the postauricular - behind the ear - lymph nodes). Lymph nodes are involved in the body's immune system, serving as sites where infections are trapped and fought off by the body's immune cells (white blood cells). Each set of lymph nodes protects a particular region of the body. The postauricular nodes are mostly involved in protecting from infection of the scalp and ear, but may also be involved in infections of the throat. 

The most likely scenario is that you had an infection of one of these areas that led to swelling of the lymph node, the normal response, which caused you to notice the node. Nodes can stay swollen for some time after the infection goes away. 

Occasionally, a swollen lymph node can be a sign of a serious medical problem, such as a blood cancer. However, these lymph nodes are usually quite a bit larger than 'lentil-sized.' Therefore, I think the chances of this are very low. 

However, I do agree with your decision to have the spot checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who will be able to tell you if further workup is needed. "
"""Does smoking hookah affect how long I take to recover from a cold?""","Hookah is an inhaled smoked substance that differs from other smoking products as it is filtered through water. I would strongly recommend you see your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> to discuss your medical situation. 

To answer your question -- yes, smoking hookah will prolong your recovery from a cold. A cold, or medically known as an upper respiratory tract infection is caused by inflammation of the upper airways and nasal passages. This inflammation is mostly caused by virus that infect this upper airway, although bacteria can do this as well. Normally, it take 5-7 days for your body to clear the infection and decrease the inflammation in the airways.

Anything that prolongs the inflammation will cause an worsened cold. Smoke inhalation, even if filtered through water, will cause inflammation of the airways. Therefore I would strongly recommend stopping hookah.

Keep in mind that smoking alone can cause inflammation and cold symptoms. You may no have a cold but simply a <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a> from smoking. 

Also keep in mind that any smoke inhalation increases one's risk for lung disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) is increased in smokers, as is lung cancer. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>."
Why am I always tired?,"Fatigue is a common symptom. There are many causes of such, some of which can be medically treated. I would encourage you do discuss this with your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a>. I recommend seeing your doctor as soon as possible.

In general, a few causes of fatigue should be evaluated. The first is low thyroid levels, known as hypothyroidism. The thyroid hormone is the energy hormone, so low levels cause fatigue, cold feeling, constipation and skin changes. A simple blood test can evaluate this.

Another common cause of fatigue in women is low blood levels, known as anemia. This can be from excessive menstrual <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. If you have bleeding in excess from any location, including during your period, this could be the cause. Some patients develop iron deficiency from this which worsens the anemia. A blood test can rule this out.

Another major cause of fatigue is <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> -- it is actually very common. Depression is associated with decreased energy, change in appetite, changes in sleep, feeling sad or guilty and a decreased concentration. This is more common in people who have gone through traumatic experiences such as war. IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF HURTING YOURSELF OR OTHERS, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

I would strongly encourage you to talk to your doctor."
What's the best types of food to eat when ill?,"I am not sure if you are asking about what to eat when you have a common <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> (such as a cold) or if you mean that the fact that you frequently do not eat because you are on the go gives you an unpleasant feeling in the stomach. 

In the case of the former, the best rule while suffering with a common illness is to drink plenty of fluids. The body needs fluids more than food when it is sick. It is also best to avoid dehydrating beverages (such as alcohol and caffeine) while ill, focusing instead on water, juice, and the like. Simple, bland foods such as crackers, fruits, and thin soups are often easier to digest, especially if you have nausea. Stay away from spicy or greasy foods. 

On the other hand, in the case of being constantly on the go, forgetting to eat will lead to a sour tasting stomach and perhaps nausea. You might be able to avoid this by making sure to pack your bag when you leave in the morning with small snacks. This way, even if you do not have time to stop and eat a full meal, you will at least have some nutrition throughout the day. 

Feel free to talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at any point about how to keep your nutrition up and how to deal with the stress of being a college student. "
why is my uvula swollen?,"A swelling of the uvula is known as uvulitis. The most common causes of uvulitis are the same as the causes of swelling of the tonsils (tonsillitis) and the back of the throat (pharyngitis) - in other words, viral and bacterial infections of the throat. Sometimes the uvulitis is more prominent than the tonsillitis or pharyngitis, but the process is the same. Generally, these cases are self limiting and can be treated with rest, fluids, and over the counter anti inflammatory medications. 

Less commonly, uvulitis can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. This may occur even if you do not have a prior history of allergy. If your have tongue or lip swelling, or if you have any wheezing or trouble breathing, these could be signs of a serious allergy, and you should see your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> or go to the emergency room as soon as possible. 

Occasionally, swelling of the uvula, even from just a common viral infection, can be significant enough to make it difficult to swallow. In these cases you should see your doctor or go to the emergency room as soon as possible, to make sure the swelling is not in any danger of closing off the passage of air in your throat. "
My legs and ankles swell very badly after I have been sitting at my computer for 2-3 hours.  Is there something can do to eliminate this swelling?,"What you are describing sounds like dependent edema.  In your case I think it is caused by venous insufficiency, which causes blood to pool in your legs and fluid to seep out into your tissue.  When you are sitting, the blood coming from your lower legs has a hard time getting back to the heart.  As a result, some of the fluid must leave the veins in the lowest part of the legs.  While lowering your salt intake is almost always a good idea, it is only likely to have a small effect on your leg edema (but a good thought).  Perhaps the best first step for you to take is to spend less time in your chair in front of the computer.  You could start by standing up periodically and walking around the room to get your blood flowing.  Another measure you can take is to wear compressive stockings, or T.E.D. hose.  The compression around your lower legs will prevent this fluid from leaving your veins and causing the edema.

I should say that since lower limb edema can be a sign of other diseases such as heart disease, liver disease, and kidney disease, you should be evaluated by a physician before starting any therapy yourself.  The best type of physician for you to see for this problem is a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> such as an <a href=""/internists"">internist</a>.  "
What causes the pain in the arch of my foot?,"The arch of the foot is a very complex structure, consisting of multiple bones and ligaments. Most causes of arch pain are related to the anatomy of the arch and the types of physical activity that you perform. For example, a classic set up for arch pain is people who engage in lots of high impact exercise (such as running) while wearing a type of athletic shoe that does not properly support their type of foot arch. If you notice that the twinges of pain you have are most commonly associated with or immediately after exercise, you might want to visit a good athletic shoe store to make sure you are wearing the right kind of shoe. 

Another cause of arch pain is plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia is a tough tissue structure that holds the bottom part of the arch in place. The fascia often becomes inflamed and sore, usually as a result of repetitive motion (for example, very common in those who stand on their feet for work). The pain is often noticeable first thing in the morning and worse with activity. In addition to wearing good arch supports and taking anti-inflammatory medications, stretching exercises are often a part of the treatment. 

You should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to determine what is the best treatment for you. "
Why do I have chronic chills?,"Chills are a symptom that can mean many different things.  It sounds like your chills are more than just the sensation of being cold.  I would first want to know if you are having any fevers during these times.  This will be important for your doctor to know.  If these chills are associated with fever, then they likely represent activation of your immune system.  Chronic infections that the immune system is having trouble fighting off can cause this type of presentation.  In addition, some immune system cancers such as lymphoma have been known to cause fever, chills, and sweats.  If this is not the case for you, then your doctor would have to look into other causes of feeling cold.  the first thing I would check is your thyroid gland function.  Low thyroid hormone can be a cause of low body temperature.  In addition, adrenal gland dysfunction, if severe enough can cause body temperature to drop.

i suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> (<a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a> or <a href=""/internists"">internal medicine doctor</a>).  After a detailed history of your symptoms and a thorough physical exam, I think many of those causes can be ruled.  Your doctor will likely want to order a couple of blood tests to measure your thyroid and adrenal function (if this is suspected).  I hope you get to the bottom of it.  "
Why do I have dried blood occasionally coming out of my nose when I blow it clean?,"Sinus congestion is a very common medical problem which, unfortunately, has no quick cure. The congestion occurs when the passages that drain out the sinuses into the nose become inflamed and plugged with mucus, leading to <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, pressure, drainage, cough, and occasionally (as you write here) blood with blowing the nose clean. 

The best approach to treating sinusitis involved discipline and continued application of treatments even when you are feeling well. This is because it is easier to prevent a flare of sinus congestion than to treat it once it is fully developed. 

Flonase and other nasal steroids are one of the backbones of treating sinus congestion. They are extremely effective, however in order to work they must be taken every day for long periods of time. In addition to nasal steroid sprays, I also recommend nasal irrigation with a saline spray or, better yet, the Nettypot system. This is a little uncomfortable at first but one quickly gets used to it, and it is also very effective. Using these two methods together, most cases of congestion will clear up. 

Rarely, sinus congestion requires antibiotics but these are not usually helpful. 

You should start by addresses your concerns with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and coming up with a good treatment plan together. "
How do I get rid of a large size boil on my upper leg?,"A boil (or furuncle) is a type of skin infection in which bacteria get into the base of the hair shaft and set up an infection. Often this causes redness, swelling, and a collection of pus under the skin. Many boils can be treated conservatively, meaning you can just apply warm compresses and take some over the counter pain or anti inflammatory medications. 

However, sometimes the amount of pus that builds up inside the boil is so much that the area must be opened up by a <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> to allow the pus to drain and the boil to heal. Similarly, sometimes the infection begins to spread into the skin surrounding the boil (this is called cellulitis). Based on the fact that you say the area is very swollen and quite painful, I think it is best for you to see a doctor to make sure neither of these two things are going on. 

If you have severe pain, <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, or if there is a large area of redness spreading around the boil you should not wait to see your doctor but should instead go to the emergency room for evaluation. 

After seeing a doctor, they may decide to drain the area and they may prescribed oral antibiotics. "
Why does my neck hurt so much?,"Neck pain is a common symptom. I would strongly encourage you to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to have this evaluated and potentially treated.

Neck pain is concerning, mainly because of the important structures that are located in the neck -- the air pipe (trachea), food pipe (esophagus), blood vessels (carotid arteries and jugular veins) and spine. That being said, the most common cause of neck pain is muscular pain or bone pain.

Muscular pain is often because of a sprain or strain. This causes inflammation in the neck muscle which can be exacerbated by any movement. Normally this will go away over time but occasionally the inflammation is severe and requires medicines (such as ibuprofen). In addition, physical therapy can be helpful to strengthen the muscles around the area to better support the inflamed muscle. Bone back, such as a narrowing of the spinal canal, can also cause this, although is more common in elderly people.

Fibromyalgia can cause pain in any location, although the base of the neck is a common location. While this disease is not well understood, there are treatment for this type of pain. Medicines such as elavil or prozac can be helpful. 

Massage therapy may be of benefit.

Talk to your doctor. Good luck!"
"I have frequent nosebleeds, should I be concerned?","Frequent nosebleeds can be a concerning symptom. There are some minor causes, but also some major causes that should be evaluated. I would strongly recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. In addition, an Ear - Nose - Throat (or ENT) doctor can be of help as the specialist in this area.

Nosebleeds have a few common causes. There is often an anatomic problem that can cause this. Inflammation of the nasal mucosa (lining of the nose) by an infection is common. This inflammation can effect the many tiny blood vessels and cause <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. Pressure that builds up in a sinus infection can also disrupt the nasal mucosa and cause bleeds. Sinus infections are mostly viral, but can be caused by a bacteria. 

Trauma is a common cause of infection, this most commonly comes from nose picking. This is more common in the setting of an infection, where there is increased nasal mucus. If you are, I would recommend you limit your nasal cleaning.

Another consideration, is that there is an abnormal thinness to your blood. Medicines such as aspirin and ibuprofen thin your blood. There are also other blood conditions that cause this.

I would recommend having this evaluated. You sound like you have a sinus infection -- which should be addressed by your doctor."
Why are my ankles and legs swollen?,"Ankle swelling is a common problem. This can represent both very minor conditions, as well as very serious medical problems that require further attention.

For your people, the most common cause of leg swelling is <a href=""/procedure/varicose-vein-s-1108"">varicose veins</a>. This is a condition where the veins in the legs -- the blood vessels that return blood from the foot to the heart -- become weakened over time and therefore cannot bring the fluid back. The fluid then remains in the legs. Often the skin will have bluish spider looking veins on it. Often this can be treated by a small dose of a water pill, but occasionally this requires <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> or injections.

There are other serious causes of swelling that require evaluation. There are three big causes (1) heart failure -- the heart muscle can't pump blood so it pools in the legs (2) Liver failure -- the liver can't make the appropriate proteins so fluid leaks out to the legs and (3) Kidney failure -- the kidneys lose protein and can't get rid of fluid so it builds up. There are some other rare causes, but these big three require evaluation.

Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This requires evaluation and possible treatment. Good luck! "
Why is my stool red?,"There are multiple reports of ""Code Red"" causing a reddish brown color to the stools. In fact, multiple foods that are intensely red in color (such as beets) can have the same effect. The important thing is to ensure that the color goes back to normal if you stop drinking the ""Code Red.""

Obviously the concern here would be for any sort of gastrointestinal <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. Bleeding can give the bowel movements either a bright red color (if the bleeding is lower down) or a dark black color (if the bleeding is higher up). Often there is a bad odor, and the stools may be sticky or tarry. Things that can cause this sort of bleeding include a stomach ulcer, an inflammation of the stomach lining, or <a href=""/procedure/hemorrhoids-1072"">hemorrhoids</a>. 

In someone your age with no active medical problems, these causes of gastrointestinal bleeding would be rare. However, if the stool color is persistently dark and red after stopping the ""Code Red"" or if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as fatigue, palpitations, shortness of breath, or if you begin <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> reddish liquid, then these are all signs that you are likely bleeding and that you should go to the emergency room for treatment immediately. "
I had a cough for almost one month and my cough is not getting better even though I am taking a cough syrups. Why is my cough not getting better?,"There are a number of different causes for a cough that goes on as long as this, but you should definitely see a <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> to help you sort it out. 

Allergic rhinitis, or nasal allergies, involve inflammation and swelling of the nasal passages, leading to stuffiness, mucus, and chronic cough. 

Sinusitis is an inflammation of the cavities in the skull brought about by plugging with mucus of the normal passages by which the sinuses drain into the nose, leading to congestion, headache, a sensation of fullness, and cough. 

Heartburn, or reflux disease, can also provoke a chronic cough as the acid from the stomach washes up into the mouth and irritates the back of the throat. 

Finally, in someone taking care of small children, I would also worry about the possibility of pertussis infection, or 'whooping cough', which causes a very strong cough that lasts for weeks and is often severe enough to cause soreness in the chest and ribs and may lead to gagging, retching, or <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>. 

I suggest you start by calling your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and setting up an appointment. They will most likely be able to tell which is the cause of your cough and will help you decide on a plan for treating the problem. "
"I have Hepatitus C and I am concerned it is affecting my energy, what can I do that is healthy for my liver to increase my energy?","Fatigue is a common symptom. I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as there are many medical causes of this which should be ruled out. In addition, I would recommend that you see a hepatologist (a liver specialist) to further investigate your hepatitis C.

In general, fatigue is very common. Hepatitis C can cause fatigue in a few ways: (1) The treatment for hepatitis C -- known as interferon, often causes horrible fatigue. If you are being treated, talk to your doctor. (2) If you hepatitis C is progressing and causing severe liver inflammation, this can cause fatigue. Signs of this would include leg swelling, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a> and possibly yellowing of the skin or eyes. You should have your liver numbers checked. (3) Rarely, hepatitis C can cause liver cancer. This often causes one to be fatigued. People with hepatitis C should get regular imaging of the liver and blood tests to look for cancer.

As an aside, there are many other causes of fatigue. Low blood counts, low thyroid levels, other medicines are all causes that should be discussed. In addition, <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> is a fairly common cause.

Keep in mind caffeine will worsen fatigue long term.

Talk to your doctor immediately. "
Why does my right knee hurt all the time?,"There are a couple of common causes of knee pain in runners. 

The first is called patellofemoral pain syndrome (runner's knee). This is basically a degeneration of the cartilage in the knee cap (patella) due to misalignment of the knee cap with repetitive motion. The pain is usually under the knee cap or on the inside edge. Treatment for patellofemoral pain syndrome involves cutting back on high impact exercise, stretching exercises to loosen the calf and hamstring muscles, and straight leg raises (avoid anything that puts pressure on a bent knee). Shoes to correct pronation may also be needed. 

The second is called iliotibial band syndrome. This is an overuse <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> of the band of tissue running down the outside edge of the thigh and knee. The pain is usually on the outside edge of the knee cap. In addition to cutting down on running, especially running on inclines, stretching exercises to loosen the iliotibial band are important (you can talk to your personal trainer or gym coach to help you with these exercises). 

I recommend talking to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> to obtain a definitive diagnosis and for more help deciding how best to treat the problem. "
Why does my right heel hurt when I get up in the morning?,"Heel pain is common. The heel is actually a fairly complex structure, with many bones, muscles and ligaments involved. I would recommend seeing your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a> to have this evaluated.

The most common cause of heel pain is known as plantar fasciitis. This is normally pain at the bottom of the foot. It is often worse with putting weight on the foot, and certainly can be worse first thing in the morning. Plantar fascitis is caused by inflammation in the fascia (sheet of connective tissue) on the bottom of the foot. It is thought that this is caused by an abnormal foot arch. There are many ways to treat this. The best treatment is a supportive shoe inset (a shoe orthotic). Talk to your doctor as he or  she can provide a prescription for a specific one. There are also splints that can be worn at night to make sure the foot arch is in the correct location at night. In terms of pain control, anti - inflammatories such as ibuprofen are often helpful. Talk to your doctor before starting any medicine. For severe cases steroid injections and <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> can be helpful. Other causes of heel pain include Achilles <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> or bone problems.

See your doctor. Good luck!"
What kind of blood filter is implanted in the inner thigh?,"Blood filters ar not commonly placed in the inner thigh. While it may be possible that this is required for a specific situation, it may be that you misunderstood your <a href=""/internists"">doctor</a>. I would strongly recommend that you talk to your doctor regarding this.

That being said, there are blood filters. These are placed in the inferior vena cava (IVC) which is the blood vessel that drains blood from both legs and then returns it to the heart. The way the filters are placed are by entering a smaller vessel in the inner thigh named the femoral vein. The operator will then thread the filter up into the inferior vena cava. This may be where the confusion is coming from.

Indications for blood filters are mostly for people who develop blood clots in their legs. Blood clots can be caused because of <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the vessels, or if someone has ""thicker"" blood for some reason. Blood clots in the legs have a potential to break off and go to the heart and lungs. This can be fatal. Therefore, in rare cases <a href=""/internists"">doctors</a> place a filter to catch the clots before it gets to the heart and lungs.

Talk to your doctor if the ""IVC filter"" is required for your case."
"I am a 57 year old transcriptionist and experience grabbing, painful stabbing sensations on either side of my neck. It doesn't happen a lot, but when it does it is breathtaking and only lasts for a couple of seconds. Sometimes the area is sore and tender afterwards. What could this be a symptom of?","Neck pain is a common condition. It is also a fairly worrisome condition. I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> at once to have this evaluated.

The neck contains many vital structures. As such, any problem in the neck (even a minor one) can cause significant problems. The airpipe (trachea), blood vessels to the brain (carotid arteries), spinal cord, food pipe (esophagus) are all structures that can be harmed. Therefore any neck pain should be evaluated.

Fortunately, it sounds (although full examination is required) that you are suffering from musculoskeletal pain. The neck actually contains many muscles that must move in many directions. Inflammation of these muscles can cause this type of pain. 

Thyroid problems can also cause this. The thyroid, when inflamed, can cause this pain -- known as thyroiditis. This again requires evaluation. 

In addition, there are many lymph nodes in the neck. Any inflammation of these (from infection or from cancer) can cause neck pain. Note the lymph nodes of the neck drain the neck, face and mouth. Therefore dental problems can also cause this.

I would recommend seeing your primary care doctor first. If further assistance is needed, your primary care doctor may refer you to an ENT (ear nose throat) doctor who specialize in neck problems. Good luck!"
How can I prevent knee soreness?,"The symptoms you are experiencing, especially the fact that the pain is most severe after sitting for extended periods of time, is most consistent with something called patellofemoral pain syndrome (also known as ""runner's knee""). This is an extremely common cause of knee pain, especially in young athletes. The condition is caused when cartilage in the patella (knee cap) degenerates under the repeated stress of high impact physical activity. 

The mainstay of treatment is to reduce your level of physical activity, especially of high impact activities, to give the cartilage a chance to regenerate. You should also avoid all weight lifting and other exercises that involve bending the knee, as bending the knee puts more stress on the patella. Strengthening exercises of the quadriceps are helpful, however these should be straight leg lifts to avoiding stressing the patella. If you have tight hamstrings or calf muscles, stretching exercises to loosen these should also be performed. 

Finally, you should have an athletic trainer determine if you overpronate your feet, because if you do then shoes to correct the pronation will be of some use. 

Treating patellofemoral pain syndrome can require patience and time. It is best to work on this condition in collaboration with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a>.  "
What can cause pain in your right lower side?,"Right lower pain is a concern. There are many important structures in this area which can cause pain. I would strongly recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> in order to better evaluate this situation and subsequently treat it if required.

The right side of the abdomen, below the ribs, is classified medically as the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The right upper quadrant contains many important structures. Most often, in otherwise your healthy people, it is actually not the insides that are causing the pain, but a part of the musculoskeletal system. Muscle or rib joint inflammation can cause this pain because of a sprain or strain.

However, there are many other important structures that can cause pain. The lungs (lower part of the right lung) can cause this is they are inflamed. A <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a> or a blood clot can cause this type of ""pleurtic"" pain (pain with deep breath. Other important structures are the stomach, liver or pancreas in the area. Inflammation of any of these can cause it. Most importantly, the gallbladder is here. What you describe would be consistent with gallstones.

This requires evaluation. Many of the above structures are vital and require attention. See your doctor."
Why does the bottom of my tongue hurt when I go running?,"The good news is that if this is a problem that you have lived with for the last 6 years and if it has not gotten worse and only occurs with vigorous exercise, then it is unlikely to be a serious medical problem.

Nevertheless, I can think of two possible explanations. The first is that the pain is related to muscle strain or fatigue in the muscles of the jaw and floor of the mouth. Sometimes, people clench the muscles of their jaws when they are exercising intensely. If you are doing this, you may find that these muscles ache after you get done with a long period of exercise. 

Another possibility is that you are getting dehydrated. With vigorous exercises, the body loses a lot of salt and water. When these losses become extreme, they can produce various sensations, including weakness, <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, visual changes, and <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> or other strange sensations in the mouth. You may want to try keeping yourself better hydrated will exercising, especially during hot weather, and see if this makes a difference. 

To better understand these symptoms, you should discuss them with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. "
What should I do if I keep having stye in my eye?,"As you well know, a stye can be very bothersome as it is not only painful, but also cosmetically problematic.  In general, a stye is not caused by any kind of nutritional deficiency. Instead, a stye results from an infection in one of the sebaceous glands at the base of the eyelashes.  If you are having recurrent styes, it is possible that your skin may be colonized with a type of bacteria that is causing a troublesome infection.  It is also possible that the stye you have is not fully resolving and is instead flaring up over and over.  If you have not yet seen an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a>, this would be the best place to start.  An ophthalmologist specializes in the care of the eye, and he or she can do a thorough eye exam to identify if you have any specific anatomic issues with your eyelashes or eyelids that might predispose you to developing these kinds of infections.  An ophthalmologist may also be able to suggest some precautionary measures that you can take to prevent these kinds of infections from developing.  Hopefully this can help address the reasons why you keep developing a recurrent stye and prevent this from continuing to occur!"
Can an eye become permanently blind from a poke?,"I would definitely recommend that your father go to see his <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> about this issue. It is possible that whatever is going on with his eye might be related to his previous eye <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>. It is also, however, possible that this could be caused by a number of other eye conditions. 

For example, if the white color is right in the center of the pupil, then this might represent a <a href=""/procedure/cataract-1307"">cataract</a>, which is a condition in which the lens in the eye degenerates over time, mostly due to aging. This definitely can lead to trouble seeing. 

On the other hand, if the white discoloration is more in a circle around the colored part of the eye, then this might be arcus senilis, which is a benign change in the eye that occurs with aging and does not affect vision. 

Finally, if the white discoloration is more ""on top"" of the eye and irregular, then this might represent corneal scarring, which would be more likely to have been caused by previous trauma to the eye. 

Regardless, the most important step is for him to see his eye doctor, who can figure out what is going on and what can be done about it."
How can I get rid of this bump on my eyelid?,"It sounds like this probably was a stye (also known as a hordeolum) which is a localized infection which typically develops at the base of one of the eyelashes or within one of the small glands that line the edge of the eyelid. Generally a stye will evolve to the point where it develops a white head and then pops and drains. At this point, most styes will go away completely. 

However, since your bump is still there, this suggests that it may have evolved into a chalazion, which is a more chronic inflammatory condition that can persist for a long while. Sometimes, chalazions will respond to continued compresses as you are doing. However, sometimes they can require additional treatment. 

For this reason, I would recommend making an appointment to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. They can help you decide whether something needs to be done right now. For example, sometimes a chalazion needs to be opened up and removed surgically. Other times, a local injection of a steroid medication may help the bump resolve. 

Either way, start by calling and making an appointment with your eye doctor for an evaluation, and good luck!"
Does a stye ever go away?,"Styes are very common problems which occur when one of the glands at the edge of the eyelid becomes clogged. They can be very stubborn and take a while to clear up, from weeks to months. Most of the time, no specific medical treatment other than warm compresses are needed, which should be applied multiple times through out the day to help the stye come to a head and drain out. 

However, if you have had this stye for quite a while and it is not getting any better, it would be worth seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about it. Sometimes the stye can become infected or very inflamed, in which case antibiotics are occasionally needed to help clear things up. 

Very rarely, a stye will be resistant both to treatment with warm compresses or with antibiotics. In these cases, a referral to an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> if often needed. There numbing medication will be applied to the stye, and a minor surgical procedure will be used to open up the stye and help it to drain out completely. 

Start by contacting your primary care doctor for advice, and they will help you decide if additional treatments are needed right now or not. "
What to do if a child has pink eye?,"This is an important question to discuss with your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. The vast majority of pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is due to viruses. The conjunctivitis in this case typically leads to itching and redness of the eye, associated with a thin watery discharge and sticking of the eyelashes, especially in the morning. One or both eyes may be infected, and the infection can spread from one to the other. Often, an exposure to another person who has recently had pink eye, or the recent development of other viral symptoms is apparent (such as cough, <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, etc). The treatment in this case is targeted towards the symptoms, and can involve warm compresses and artificial tears to keep the eyes moist. Typically the symptoms resolve in a few days, and no systemic symptoms (such as fevers or rash) are apparent.

Again, these are questions to discuss with your son's pediatrician. You should also be sure to call your son's <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a> if his symptoms do not resolve after 3 to 4 days, or if there are any other worrisome symptoms that develop, such as eye pain or fever or thick purulent discharge from the eyes, which can be a sign of bacterial infection. In this latter case, antibiotic ointment may be prescribed. "
Why is my wife told never to lie on her back after torn retina treatment?,"What is likely going on is that, during the retina repair <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, her <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> probably injected a gas bubble into the eye. This bubble is supposed to act like a ""splint"", helping to reinforce the retina and keep it in place at the back of the eye while it heals and reattaches. 

However, since gas bubbles are subject to the forces of gravity and will tend to rise upwards through the liquid inside the eye, it is important to avoid any position that would cause the bubble to float away from the retina. Specifically, this means no lying on your back, because this would cause to the bubble to move towards the front of the eye where the pupil is. If this occurred, the bubble would no longer be in contact with the retina and eye healing could be interrupted or slowed down. 

Your wife should pay close attention to the instructions about what positions she can have her head in for the length of time recommended by her eye doctor. Over time, the retina will heal and the gas bubble will dissipate, at which point she will be able to go back to her normal activities and positions. I recommend that your wife discuss this issue with her doctor to make sure that you have understood these instructions correctly."
What would make my under-eye swell?,"You should go see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a> right away. There is at least one very serious cause of eye swelling, called cellulitis, which needs to be ruled out. Cellulitis is a generic medical term for bacterial infection of the skin, but cellulitis around the eye needs particularly close attention and aggressive treatment, because the infection can spread backwards towards the eye and, even, in rare cases, through they eye socket towards the brain. 

Your doctor should be able to tell quickly whether or not this is a cellulitis and, if so, they can help you decide which antibiotics are needed to treat the infection. In some serious cases, it may be necessary to be hospitalized for intravenous antibiotics until the infection gets under control. 

If your doctor feels that this is not cellulitis, then they will be able to consider alternative possibilities, which could include a simple viral infection of the eye, such as conjunctivitis, as well as allergic exposures. These conditions can generally be treated with simple measures, such as topical medications and warm compresses, as well as good hygiene to prevent spread of infection (in the case of conjunctivitis). 

Please contact your doctor's office as soon as you can. "
Is lasik safe for people with very bad vision?,"LASIK <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, as you know, is an increasingly popular procedure for permanent correction of vision problems. The procedure has been around quite a while now and, for most patients, it is a safe and excellent option for definitive vision correction. 

However, there are several factors that impact the success of the LASIK procedure. The procedure works best for patients who have relatively minimal nearsightedness (myopia). Good outcomes from the procedure are much less easy to predict for people who have severe myopia and also for those who have astigmatism. The combination of bad myopia and astigmatism in the same eye is a set up for the least predictable outcomes. 

Therefore, the answer to your question is that it depends largely on how bad your myopia and astigmatism is. What I would suggest is that you have a formal evaluation by your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> or by an eye <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. They will be able to measure your degree of myopia and astigmatism. Based on these numbers, they will be able to provide you with a more formal estimate of whether or not the procedure is likely to be successful for you. Make an appointment with your eye doctor at your earliest convenience, and good luck!"
Why is my right eye is swollen when I wake up in the morning?,"Trabeculectomy is a common surgical procedure that is usually used to treat glaucoma, which is a condition in which the pressure inside the eye builds up over time. If glaucoma is left untreated, it can lead to permanent loss of vision. After a trebeculectomy procedure, it is important to have regular follow up eye examinations with your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. 

The swelling of your eye may or may not be related to your history of glaucoma. If the swelling is in the tissue around your eye (for example, the eyelids), then it may be caused by an infection or by common things like eye allergies. These are conditions that are usually treated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, and you could see them for evaluation and for a decision on which medications to use to relieve the symptoms. On the other hand, if the swelling is in the eye itself, especially if there is any pain or redness (it doesn't sound like there is), then this could be concerning for recurring glaucoma and you would need to seek emergency evaluation by your eye doctor. In either case, please speak to your doctor soon."
Why do I always view the TV at an angle?,"While this is certainly an interesting habit that you and your daughter share, it is likely more of a coincidence than a real medical issue, provided that you have no other symptoms. One possible cause that should be examined, however, is whether or not your daughter (and you as well) have normal vision in both eyes and that both eyes are contributing to the information that your brain processes. While most people prefer one eye over the other (just as most people are either right or left handed), such an extreme as you are describing could indicate that the other eye is not being used at all. A simple vision test with your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> or <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a> should be able to clarify that point. Another possible cause could be with regards to the strength and positioning of your neck, or even something as simple as how you have the TV set up in the room. If the habit is present regardless of which side of the TV you are sitting on, then it is less likely to be clinically relevant in this latter case. Please speak to your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a>, however, to make sure that there is nothing bigger contributing to this interesting habit. "
My eye gets stuck and waters. Why?,"Epiphora is the name that <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctors</a> use to describe watery eyes with tears that are constantly building up in your eyes and can intermittently run down your face. While there are many causes, bacteria that can be treated with drops are only one of the causes. The fact that your symptoms have gone on for 3 years now indicates that you need to see a specialist to be able to fully identify what is causing your problem. In the absence of any vision changes or constant irritation, it is possible that you could have a problem with the tear duct itself. Sometimes, infections can lead to scarring that will make it impossible for tears to drain from the eye in the normal fashion. Another common cause of epiphora is constant irritation, as when the lashes of the eye rub against the sclera (the white part) of your eye constantly. If this is happening, it can lead to problems with your eye over the long term, and is a reason to be seen by your doctor sooner rather than later. Again, a specialist would best be able to help you. Please speak with an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> about your problem for more help and solutions. "
How do you prevent dry eyes?,"This would be a good issue to raise with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, especially if it is persistent and if you find that the eye drops from the drug store are not working. 

Sometimes, dry eyes during the winter are just due to irritation of the eyes by the cold and wind and dry air. In these cases, there is no real magic solution to the problem, although protecting your face when you go outside (for example using wrap around sunglasses to shield your eyes) is probably the most important step. Additionally, one of several types of artificial tears or rewetting drops might be of use. You should, however, avoid long and protracted use of ""anti redness"" drops, as these can, over time, actually lead to worsening of the problem. 

Some people find that their dry eyes during the winter are actually the result of indoor allergies, such as mold, dust, mites, or <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a> dander. In these cases, a medication to help counter the symptoms of the allergies might be the most effective thing. 

Your primary care doctor can examine you for any evidence of allergy and, if those symptoms are present, help you decide which medications might be right for you. "
Did my head injury give me a black eye?,"The tissue around the eyeball is very delicate and it is full of slender veins which very easily burst, causing blood to leak out and creating the 'black eye.' It is pretty common with any blow to the forehead, cheeks, and the like to accidentally rupture some of these blood vessels, causing a black eye, even when the eye was not directly struck. Therefore, I think that it was indeed the elbow to the forehead that caused your black eye!

Most of the time a black eye is not a big deal, except of course cosmetically. Generally, the body does a good job healing itself up and the black discoloration will go away slowly over a period of days to weeks. 

However, I always recommend that anyone who has had a black eye get checked out by their <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. The purpose of this visit it to make sure that no other damage was done to the eye or to any of the other bones of the face. At this visit, your doctor can also give you some advice on medications you might take to reduce any pain or swelling associated with the <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>. 

I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Why is my left eye swelling?,"Since these symptoms have been going on for quite a while, I would strongly recommend that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for an evaluation. Any persistent symptoms like this need to be looked at, to help figure out what might be going on and what treatments might be available to you. 

One likely cause of your symptoms would be eye allergies, also known as allergic conjunctivitis. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include redness, itching, and increased production of tears. The common causes of allergic conjunctivitis include exposure to indoor allergens like mold and mites. They are also common in the spring and fall pollen seasons. 

Your doctor can examine you for any signs of eye allergies. If they confirm this diagnosis there are, fortunately, multiple medications that can be prescribed to help to alleviate the symptoms! These medications include standard anti histamine oral medications as well as a number of different anti allergy eye drops. 

Your doctor can also look for other alternative causes of your eye symptoms, which could include an <a href=""/procedure/eye-infection-100"">eye infection</a> or a scratch in the surface of the eye. 

Make an appointment with your primary care doctor at your earliest convenience, and good luck!"
How do you fix your eye if you think that it is scratched?,"From the description of your <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, it does sound like you could indeed have scratched your cornea, the outer surface of the eyeball.  Corneal abrasions are common injuries after some sort of trauma to the face/eye, and symptoms include pain in the eye, tearing of the eye, redness, and the sensation of something ""gritty"" or ""stuck"" in the eye.  Corneal abrasions typically do not cause significant changes in vision.  However, it is also possible that you have sustained a more serious injury to the eye or could be developing an infection, particularly since you were hit in the eye with a tree branch.  The best thing for you to do now is make sure you have a prompt examination of your eye.  Testing for a corneal abrasion can be done in the emergency department, and if abnormalities are noted, an eye specialist can be called to come see you.  However, the same testing can also be done in a clinic visit with an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a>.  If you can get an appointment with an eye specialist right away that is fine, but if you can't get a prompt appointment, the best thing to do is go the emergency department to expedite the exam. Hopefully your eye will be feeling better soon, and you won't have any further run-ins with tree branches."
What happened to my vision today?,"Any acute changes in your vision are something that should be addressed with a health care provider in person. Most often, a complete eye examination is necessary to make sure that there is nothing serious going on. There are many important additional questions that need to be answered due to the fact that it could either be something serious, or, more likely, something that is normal. Depending on the other medical conditions that you have, your vision history, and your family history, your brief symptoms could take on an entirely different meaning. Because of the huge variability in the possible explanations of your symptoms (spanning everything from headaches to things that are much more serious and could be vision or even life threatening), it is important to speak with a <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a> soon about your symptoms, especially if you have never had them before (or alternatively, if you are having them more frequently. In the context of things that are potentially very severe, it is important to actually speak with a doctor in person rather than just obtain information via the internet. Please speak to your doctor or an opthalmologist as soon as possible. "
Is vitreous detachment always accompanied by floaters?,"You could be suffering from a few different problems after your trauma to the head.  Vitreous detachment occurs when the vitreous humor detaches from the retina at that back of the eye.  This causes certain retinal nerves to fire inappropriately which can cause flashes of light.  In addition, there are retinal cells that become dislodged which can then be seen within the eye.  These cells are what make up the so called floaters that we all see.  When you have trauma to the eye and vitreous detachment, there is an increase in these cells which does increase the number of floaters.  Retinal detachment is a related condition in which the retina tears away from the back of the eye usually in response to head trauma.  Flashes of light and an increase in the number of floaters is accompanied by retinal detachment.  You could have either of these problems.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist.  This is a specialist of the eye that is most qualified to examine and diagnose the types of problems that you most likely have.  In addition, <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologists</a> are trained to perform any necessary surgical operations that may help restore or save your vision, if it is currently at risk.  Good luck.  "
Why do I see little flashes of light?,"These flashes of light could be due to a variety of different causes.  When anyone reports flashes of light, I always want to make sure that they are not suffering from retinal detachment.  This is where the retina brakes off from the back of the eye usually due to some sort of head trauma.  This does not sound like you.  Glaucoma is caused by high pressure within the eye and can cause flashes of light, eye pain, and sometimes vision loss.  It also causes an increase in the cup to disc ratio, which is what you may be referring to with ""cupping"" in the back of both eyes.  <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">Migraine</a> headaches have also been known to cause various different ""auras"" which can be flashes of light similar to what you are experiencing.  If you are having accompanying headaches, this should be considered as a possibility.

Please schedule an appointment with an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a>.  He or she can listen to your description of the flashing lights, test your vision, and examine the back of your eyes very carefully.  Your ophthalmologist will be able to distinguish between all the different possible conditions that you could have and initiate the appropriate treatment.  Good luck.  "
Why do my eyes hurt?,"Eye pain can indicate many different things.  Injuring the cornea, as can occur with any kind of trauma or irritation (as when any kind of irritant is trapped under the eye) can be extremely painful and give the sensation of something being ""stuck"" in the eye.  However, it would be rather unusual to have this happen at the same time in both eyes, without some sore of preceding trauma.  Infections such as conjunctivitis (so-called 'pink eye') can also cause eye pain, but this would be accompanied by a noticeably red eye as well as discharge.  Other conditions involving inflammation inside the eye can cause bilateral eye pain, particularly with movement.

In general, the best thing for you to do is talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> about getting a referral to an eye specialist.  <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">Eye doctors</a> have several specialized pieces of equipment in their office that can help them examine the eye, including retina and posterior chambers.  It will also be important to check your visual acuity to make sure that your vision is not being affected as well as perform a complete neurological exam.  Together, the results of a detailed eye exam and your history will likely suggest a cause for your symptoms and help your doctor give you more information about any further treatments that might be needed."
Why does my eye hurt when I blink?,"There are several different causes of eye pain like what you are describing. It is very important to have any new eye symptom, such as pain, evaluated immediately by a <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a>. I would suggest that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> as soon as possible. If the pain is very severe or worsening and you cannot get in to see your doctor right away, you can also go to an emergency room for more rapid evaluation. 

One of the most common causes of pain with blinking the eye like you describe would be a scratch on the cornea, which is the clear surface part of the eye. Scratches on the cornea can occur for many different reasons, most commonly due to minor trauma or from irritation from wearing contacts. 

Similarly, another cause of the type of pain you describe would be conjunctivitis, which is an infection of the surface of the eye, which can be caused by either viruses  or bacteria. 

Your doctor can examine your eyes and help figure out what is going on and, if medications are needed, they can prescribe those also. While waiting to see your doctor, do not wear any contact lenses and refrain from rubbing the eye. "
What is the best way to get rid of pink eye?,"Pink eye, as you probably know, is a form of <a href=""/procedure/eye-infection-100"">eye infection</a> (it is also called infectious conjunctivitis). Symptoms include a painful ""gritty"" feeling in the eye, eye drainage, blurry vision, and redness of the white part of the eye. 

In adults most cases of pink eye are caused by various viral infections. These tend to be self resolving and do not need any specific medication to speed up healing. Generally, they are treated with warm compresses to the eye and good hand hygiene (the drainage from the involved eye is full of virus and can easily spread the infection to your other eye or to another person). 

However, there are some cases of conjunctivitis that are caused by bacteria, and these should be treated with an antibiotic, usually just  a topical antibiotic eye drop or eye ointment. Typically the conjunctivitis that is caused by a bacteria infection results in larger amounts of thick eye drainage and increased redness and pain. 

You should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. They will be able to examine your eye and help determine whether or not your infection would benefit from a prescription for antibiotics. 

Good luck, and I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Why are my eyes always so watery?,"The most common cause of watery eyes is chronic irritation of the eyes, typically from exposure to irritating substances in the air (such as dust particles) or from eye allergies, for which the medical term is allergic conjunctivitis. The chronic irritation to the surface of the eyes caused by these conditions stimulates tear production as a defense mechanism, which leads to the watery eyes. 

Other symptoms that are associated with chronic irritation of the eyes would include eye redness and eye itching. If you have these symptoms, you should definitely see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible, as there are very effective medications that can be used to treat these symptoms, including oral anti histamine medications (like loratidine/Claritin and cetirizine/Zyrtec) as well as various types of anti allergy eye drops. 

Another, much rarer, cause of excessive tearing is obstruction or partial blockage of the tear duct that is supposed to drain the tears away from the corner of the eye into the nasal passages. When you go to see your primary care doctor, in addition to evaluating you for chronic eye irritation as the cause of your excessive tearing, they will also be able to assess if you might have any duct blockage. "
Why am I seeing flashes of light?,"It sounds like you have already had this problem fairly well worked up by your team of doctors.  As you are probably aware, the most common cause of persistent flashes of light to the one side of one eye is a detached retina.  It sounds like your doctors were worried about this as well because you've already had three eye exams and a <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a> to look for it.  Most likely, you have injured your retina, but in a way that is not picked up on the CT scan.  Since it is not detached, this injury should heal on its own and the flashes of light should go away.  The normal imaging is very reassuring.  In terms of your sinus infection, this type of thing is fairly common to see on a CT scan.  You should be treated with antibiotics if you have symptoms such as a headache with a very runny nose.  

I suggest that you continue to follow with an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a>.  This is the best type of <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a> to follow and treat any issues with your vision going forward.  It is also the type of doctor most qualified to examine your retina on a regular basis to makes sure that it appears normal.  Hopefully, your vision will return to normal on its own soon.  Good luck.  "
Can you get a pimple on your eye lid?,"Changes around or near your eye can be very unsettling.  However, your description of a white pimple on the upper eye lid sounds like it could something called a stye, or infection of the small sebaceous glands at the base of the eyelashes.  Styes usually appear suddenly and can be very painful.  They usually resolve on their own, and the preferred treatment is application of warm compresses to try and naturally ""open"" the pocket of infection.  Manual rupture of a stye is not recommended because of the risk of serious infection in/near the eye.  If a stye does not go away on it's own, an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye specialist</a> can do a small incision and drainage in an office setting.

In your case, the best thing to do is make an appointment with an eye specialist for an exam and any recommended treatment.  You may well have a stye and the physician will recommend that you use warm compresses and wait for it to resolve, but it is also good to make sure that there isn't anything else going on with your eye or with your vision.  If you wear contacts, it may also be a good idea to switch to glasses until this resolves.  An eye specialist can go over all of your questions and help make sure that this issue resolves with no lasting effects on your vision."
Are there any eye exercises that can cure a lazy eye?,"I am sorry to hear that this has been such a persistent problem for you. The medical name for lazy eye is amblyopia, which refers to a basically normal internal eye structure which does not function normally for one of several different reasons. Unfortunately, amblyopia can be a very difficult thing to correct once you reach adulthood, as the brain and the eyes are much less adaptable than they are during childhood. However, I suggest that you start by going to see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for a full evaluation. 

The first thing that your eye doctor will try to do is figure out what the underlying cause for the lazy eye is. A very common cause is <a href=""/procedure/eye-misalignment-strabismus-453"">strabismus</a>, or 'crossed eyes,' which occurs when the eye muscles do not allow the eyes to line up properly. Most cases of strabismus are treated with a combination of special eyewear, eye patches, and eye drop medications. There are other, less common, causes of lazy eye, which can include cataracts or other defects that obstruct light entry into the eye; these are also things that your eye doctor will be looking out for. 

Based on what your eye doctor finds, they will be able to help you decide what the next steps towards treatment are. "
Does being anemic make your eyes red?,"Anemia, or low levels of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood, actually has the tendency to make parts of your body more pale, not more red. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that your red and bloodshot eyes have anything to do with underlying anemia. 

However, you should still go see your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> about your symptoms, as there are several medical conditions that can cause red or bloodshot eyes, and these are generally easy to treat. 

For example at the top of the list would be allergic conjunctivitis, or eye allergies. In addition to eye redness, there is often itching or watering of the eyes. Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated by identifying and avoiding the provoking allergen, and also by taking either anti allergy eye drops or oral anti histamine medications as directed by your doctor. 

Red eyes might also be a sign of infectious conjunctivitis, or an eye infection. In adults these are usually caused by common viruses and tend to run their course, but it is worth getting your doctor's opinion because sometimes they do require antibiotics to clear up. 

Make an appointment to see your doctor at your earliest convenience!"
Why is my eyelid swelling?,"Since this is something that has been going on for quite some time, you should definitely seek medical evaluation from your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a>. I would probably start by setting up an visit with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who can help figure out what is going on, as there are several possibilities. 

One possibility is that you have a condition called blepharitis, which is an inflammation of the edge of the eyelid right where the eyelashes grow out. Often there is redness and crusting drainage from the eyelid, in addition to swelling. Similarly, you could have a stye, which is essentially a blocked gland at the edge of the eyelid. Both blepharitis and styes are generally easy to treat, often just with warm compresses and perhaps a topical antibiotic ointment, depending on what your doctor recommends. 

Another condition which is often confused with eyelid swelling is something called ptosis, which is actually not swelling at all but rather eyelid lag. This can occur for several reasons, but most commonly involves some damage to or swelling of the nerve that controls the eyelid. Most of the time, this is a benign condition that doesn't need much treatment, but occasionally it can be an early sign of a serious problem, such as a tumor pressing on the nerve, so you need to have it checked out by your doctor. "
What does it mean if I have double vision?,"You definitely need to have this symptom checked out by your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a>. I would recommend that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> as soon as possible. 

Many times, in otherwise healthy people, occasional double vision that goes away right away can just be a sign of eye strain or eye fatigue, most often from working intensely at a computer screen or other similar work. However, even in cases of simple eye strain, it turns out that may people who com pain of eye strain are actually nearsighted and need to have their eyes examined and beginning wearing glasses or contacts for corrective vision. 

Also there are many other more serious problems that can cause double vision. These include serious neurological problems, like brain tumors, seizures, or multiple sclerosis, and more common neurological problems, like migraine. There are also various eye conditions that might cause double vision, including a buildup of pressure inside the eye, called glaucoma. 

Start by getting in to see your doctor right away. They will perform a thorough physical examination and, if there is any evidence of a serious problem, they will recommend what additional testing you will need to reach a diagnosis. "
Did I not take my antibiotics long enough?,"One of the basic principals of taking antibiotics is that you really have to complete the entire prescription of  the antibiotics, even after the symptoms are getting better and you are feeling better. Antibiotics work by slowly killing off the bacteria that are causing the infection. After a few days, most of the bacteria will be killed off, so the symptoms will be much better. However, this does not mean that all of the bacteria are gone, which is why usually the antibiotics need to be taking for seven or ten days, sometimes longer, even if the symptoms are most gone in the first two or three days. 

Stopping the antibiotics early in your case probably means that the infection has come back. Therefore, I strongly recommend that you go back to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>, whichever originally prescribed the antibiotics for you. They will take a look again at your eyes and help you determine whether the infection is coming back. I think it is likely that they will want to put you back on antibiotics. This time, however, make sure that you take the antibiotics exactly as prescribed and for the full duration that your doctor requests. "
Why do I have blood in my eye?,"It sounds like you probably have a subconjunctival hemorrhage. This is a condition in which small blood vessels under the white part of the eye rupture. The result is a bright red collection of blood in the white part of the eye. Usually subconjunctival hemorrhages are painless, but they may be uncomfortable if they are large. 

The most common reason for getting a subconjuctival hemorrhage is either an injury to the eye (which can be quite minor at times) or bursting a blood vessel from straining (coughing, laughing, sneezing, blowing your nose). 

There is no specific treatment for a subconjunctival hemorrhage. However, you should have it checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or by your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. They will be able to make sure there is no other more serious injury to the eye. Also, since the red spot seems to be getting larger in your case, they will be able to help evaluate why it seems that the <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> is continuing and if something needs to be done about that. 

When you go to see your doctor, make sure to describe exactly what happened to cause the bleeding, and also mention all of your medical problems and any medications you might be taking (especially potentially blood thinning medications like ibuprofen, aspirin, or warfarin. "
Why is my vision so blurry?,"You absolutely must see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> about this. They will be able to examine your eyes to make sure that this blurry vision is not from a serious problem that needs immediate treatment. 

By far the most common cause of blurry vision in someone who is otherwise healthy is eye strain or fatigue. This leads to intermittent blurry vision, usually mostly in the evenings or late afternoons after a long day of hard work involving the eyes, such as staring at a computer screen. Many people with recurrent eye strain or fatigue actually end up having an undiagnosed problem with nearsighted vision, and once they begin to wear glasses or contacts, the problem goes away. 

In addition to this common problem, there are other medical problems that can cause blurry vision. For example, <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> headaches very commonly are associated with flashing lights in front of the eyes and other visual disturbance which might be confused with blurry vision. Furthermore, there are several serious eye problems that your doctor will look for. For example, an infection or <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the surface of the eye may cause blurry vision (usually with pain). Also a buildup in pressure inside the eye, called glaucoma, can cause blurry vision. 

See your eye doctor right away!"
Should I be worried about blurry vision?,"You are very much correct that blurry vision is not a normal thing!  It sounds like you should be seen by an opthalmologist who can perform a more detailed exam of your eyes to make sure that there are not underlying problems.  If you already wear glasses or contacts, this may mean that your prescription needs to be adjusted.  However, the most important thing about blurry vision is the context in which it occurs.  If associated with a severe <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, vision loss, or any kind of focal neurological deficit (ie weakness, <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> or tingling, slurred speech), it may represent a medical emergency for which you should seek immediate medical attention in the emergency department.  In the setting of a prolonged period of staring at a computer screen, television, or projector screen, it is less alarming.  You should still be seen by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for an eye evaluation, but this kind of vision change most likely represents the eye strain of your eyes adjusting from staring at the screen to more normal light.  If you don't wear glasses now, your eye doctor may want to prescribe something for computer work.  In addition, you may need to limit the length of time you spend working on the computer at one period of time without taking a break for your eyes."
What does it mean if there is redness around the colored part of my eye?,"Any persistent eye symptoms, such as redness or pain, should be investigated by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. If the symptoms worsen, or if there is any change in your vision, then these might be signs of a very serious eye problem requiring immediate emergency evaluation. 

One of the most common causes of eye redness is irritation of the surface of the eyes. This can occur from exposure to dust and other particles in the air, can be associated with allergies to mold or other allergens, or it can be associated with an infection of the eyes. 

Less common, but usually more serious, are inflammatory conditions deeper in the structures of the eye, called iritis, or a rise in pressure within the eye itself, known as glaucoma. 

Your eye doctor will be able to examine your eyes and determine whether you might have one of these conditions; if so, they can suggest appropriate treatments. I suggest that you make an appointment to see your doctor at your earliest convenience and, if the redness spreads or if your vision becomes blurry, that you seek emergency help. 

You should also avoid wearing <a href=""/procedure/contact-lenses-99"">contact lenses</a> until you are evaluated, because persistent use of these can make both irritation and infection of the eye surface much worse. "
Why am I so sensitive to light?,"Sensitivity of the eyes to light is called photophobia. There are many potential causes of photophobia. Especially if this is a new problem for you, you will need to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> to help you figure out what is going on. 

In the simplest cases, photophobia occurs in people with light colored eyes and is just the result of the eye pigments not being able to absorb all of the light in the environment. However, given the fact that this seems to be a new problem for you, and the fact that even indoor lights are bothersome to you, I doubt that this is all that is going on. 

Sometimes, photophobia can be a symptom of a medical problem, like a migraine <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>. Also it can sometimes be a symptoms of a serious brain infection, like meningitis, especially if you have a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, or other concerning symptoms. If you have any symptoms like this could be a serious emergency and you should seek immediate attention. 

Additional causes of photophobia include infections in the eye or scratches on the cornea, or the surface of the eye. Your eye doctor or  your primary care doctor can help you figure this out, and you should see them immediately. "
Do I have neuritis?,"Eye pain and trouble with vision is always a medical emergency. You should go see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> immediately or, if you can't get in to see your eye doctor quickly, you should go to an emergency room for immediate evaluation. 

There are many potential causes of this problem. Neuritis, which is an inflammation of the nerve that supplies the eye, is certainly one possible cause. Other causes would include an infection in the eye or a scratch or <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">ulcer</a> on the surface of the eye. Also, this could be an inflammation of the structures of the eye themselves, or it could be glaucoma, which is a sudden buildup in pressure inside of the eye. 

Your eye doctor will be able to perform a thorough examination of your eye to help figure out what is going on. Based on what they find, they will recommend the appropriate treatment. 

Once again, I can't emphasize enough how potentially serious these symptoms may be. You have to get medical attention as soon as possible because, if this does turn out to be a serious eye problem, treatment has to be started right away to prevent lasting damage to the eye and potential loss of vision. "
Why are my eyes wobbly?,"The first thing to do is to determine whether or not you have any other associated symptoms that might be of concern. For example, do you have any dizziness or sensation that the room is spinning? Is your vision blurry, out of focus, or otherwise impaired? Do you have any headache, any trouble with coordination, or any sensitivity to light? If you answered yes to any of these questions, these are issues that should be checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor as soon as possible to help determine what is going on and, in particular, to rule out a serious neurological problem. 

If this visit with your primary care doctor checks out, it is probably still worth also having a complete eye exam with your regular <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. They can look for causes of this 'wobbly' motion (which is probably what is known medically as 'nystagmus') that might be more limited to your eyes themselves. 

Start by setting up these doctor visits to get to the bottom of this issue. I expect that your doctors will quickly be able to help you figure out what is going on. "
Why am I having pain in my eye?,"Eye pain is very alarming since our vision is so important to daily life!  If you are having pain or changes in your vision, you should always seek immediate attention, either with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or in an urgent care/emergency department setting if necessary.

Sorting out what is causing eye pain comes down to a patient's history and an examination. Your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">doctor</a> will want to know more about when this pressure and pain started. Have you had it before?  Your other medical conditions, if any, and medications will also be important to know, as this may suggest a specific cause for your symptoms.  Your doctor will also want to know about any possible trauma to the eye. With any kind of eye complaint it is also important to know if there has been any effect on your vision.  Finally, there are several ways to examine the eye itself, including a fundoscopic exam of the back of the eye as well as a slit lamp exam that allows a physician to evaluate the cornea and anterior compartments of the eye.  A combination of pain and pressure can be caused by a wide range of issues, including an infection of the outer part of the eye or the soft tissue surrounding it; conditions intrinsic to the eye such as glaucoma; inflammation of a part of the eye such as anterior uveitis (often associated with other health concerns; problems with the retina at the back of the eye; or sometimes even certain kinds of headaches that manifest themselves with eye pain.

The most important thing you can do with any symptoms involving your eye or vision is to seek medical attention right away!"
What should I do if something is stuck in my eye?,"Sorry to hear that you had something fly into your eye while riding a bicycle. I can give you my general approach to foreign bodies that make it into the eye, and give you my recommendations. First off, the type of foreign body is of utmost importance. For instance, if it is a piece of glass or something like that, I would recommend going directly to an emergency eye clinic because they can be hard to get out, can cause significant damage, and your vision isn't something to be taken lightly. Along the same lines, if you aren't sure what the foreign body is, it is safer to go to an eye clinic. If it is a chemical solution, you should follow the instructions on the MSDS sheet, which will usually involve irrigating the eye with an isotonic saline solution. This can be purchased from just about any pharmacy. If you know that the foreign body isn't something very dangerous (glass, chemicals, etc) and you want a good way to get it ot without scratching your cornea, I would recommend purchasing some saline, and warming it to room temperature and irrigating your eye copiously with it. To do this you need to bend your head over facing the ground with the affected eye open and irrigate gently with the entire solution (at least 1-2 liters). This will generally flush out most foreign bodies. You may need to repeat this multiple times. If this doesn't get it out, then you need to go to an emergency eye clinic. If you are a couple days out from the <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> already, the foreign body may already be gone (unless you can still see it), and you may just have a scratch which will need to heal. Nonetheless if you still feel something there, I would recommend going to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> to get it checked out. I hope this helps, and I wish you all the best. "
What would make my eye swell up?,"Eye swelling is a very common problem. Puffy eyes, as you call it, or swelling around the tissues surrounding the eyes, is most often caused by fluid around the eyes, also known as periorbital edema. There are several reasons for why you could be having this problem. often times, inflammation of infection of the eye or eyelid can cause pain and swelling around the eye. Allergic reactions can also cause similar symptoms. Additional causes for your symptoms include oversleeping, increased levels of salt in your diet, new drugs or cosmetics, insect bites or trauma. 
Depending on the cause, the eyelid swelling can have different time durations and can last for a short while if it is a mild reaction. 
While often puffy eyes are not of any medical significance and can be a temporary inconvenience, symptoms such as yours are concerning if your pain is severe and worsening. Typically painful swelling of the eyelid is suggestive of an infection and will require a thorough eye examination. You should make an appointment to discuss your symptoms with an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> (ophthalmologist) undergo a physical examination, so that your condition maybe treated appropriately with antibiotics. Symptoms to discuss with your doctor include any <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, vision problems, loss of movements of the eye or any signs of throat closing. "
What is trachoma?,"Trachoma is a very serious bacterial <a href=""/procedure/eye-infection-100"">eye infection</a> caused by an organism called Chlamydia trachomatis.  It is typically spread by direct contact, either with secretions from the eyes, nose, or throat of people who have the infection or sometimes from objects like towels or pillowcases that have been exposed to infected individuals.  Trachoma is a serious problem in the developing world but is much less common in developed countries.  Without treatment trachoma can lead to permanent blindness.  The symptoms of trachoma are initially very similar to that of conjunctivitis (a nonspecific term for infection/inflammation of the eye), including pain in the eye, redness, swelling, and discharge.  Patients with trachoma can also have other associated symptoms of the ears, nose, and throat.

If you are concerned about a possible eye infection, it is important that you be examined right away.  If you are currently living in the United States it is much more likely that any eye infection or conjunctivitis is caused by a virus or bacteria other than trachoma, but any complication involving the eye should be taken seriously. If you can't get a same-day appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or urgent care clinic, you can be seen in the emergency department.  It will be important for a physician to examine your eyes to help determine if you need any particular treatment."
Why do I keep getting shingles?,"This is a very unusual and unfortunate problem for you to be suffering from on such a routine basis, and I am sorry that you are going through this again. It would be important to know if you have been medically diagnosed, by a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a>, each of these times, or if there is more to the story. Sometimes an infection that seems to be similar to the previous infection can actually be something else entirely. If you have truly had all of these infections so often, then it would be important to see an infectious disease doctor to find out why. Again, this is unusual. Your body, whenever it gets stressed or has a low immune response for any other reason, is more prone to developing shingles, as the virus will lay dormant in your nerve cells for an extended period of time, only to flare up when you are weak in the future. Your recent shot could explain that, as it is a stress that could have caused the flare. Because you have had so many problems, speaking with an infectious disease doctor could mean the difference in getting to the bottom of your problem and helping you feel better. Please speak to your doctor. "
When should I start thinking about pain management?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are having such trouble with neck pain! Unfortunately, for many people, this is a chronic issue. The fact that you have had two surgeries for neck pain without much relief suggest, to me, that it is definitely time to start thinking about multidisciplinary approaches to dealing with your pain, because it is unlikely that a third surgery will magically take care of all the problems that the first two surgeries did not. 

To this end, you might want to consider visiting a pain management or chronic pain clinic. These are multidisciplinary clinics that include <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctors</a> specialized in medications and other approaches to dealing with chronic pain, together with physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapists</a>, social workers, counselors, and other people all there to help you come up with a plan to be as functional and independent as possible in your life. 

If you do not have a pain clinic in mind, you could start by talking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who should be able to give you recommendations and a referral to a local pain center. 

Good luck, and I hope that, with help from a pain clinic, you can start to have some relief of your symptoms!"
Heal time for multiple back injuries?,"The time of your recovery will depend on many factors.  It sounds like your <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> was quite severe and may take a long time to fully heal.  The fractures you suffered from will likely heal on their own.  As long as they heal correctly, they should not result in any chronic pain, as long as your pain was fairly well controlled in the weeks to months after your injury.  The other source of your pain is going to come from your disc herniations and nerve damage.  Therapy for these injuries could include <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, steroid injections, spinal cement injections, physical therapy, and various different types of pain medications.  You will need to be seen by multiple specialists for all of these therapies.  Your disc herniations will be best treated with physical therapy, different injections and possibly surgery (as a last resort).  Your nerve damage pain should be treated with neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a pain medicine specialist.  This is the type of <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a> that is used to dealing with nerve injury pain, and low back pain of other causes.  This doctor will also be qualified to perform steroid injection in areas that would obviously benefit from that therapy.  Your doctor may also decide that orthopedic surgical referral is necessary at some point.  Good luck.  "
Who can I talk to about pain management?,"Pain management is an extremely important part of managing your health if you are a patient who suffers from chronic pain.  It sounds like you have been through at least some medical evaluation and workup before, and there may well be additional tests and studies that a physician may want to do in the evaluation of your symptoms.  However, you may well be the kind of patient who will greatly benefit from an interdisciplinary pain program.  The best way to be connected with this kind of program is through your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> as the emergency department is not an effective way to manage chronic pain.  Your physician should be able to talk with you about a pain management service that his or her practice can refer patients to.  Many pain clinics are staffed by anesthesiologists or other physicians with specialized training in managing pain.  However, working with mental health providers and physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapists</a> can also be very helpful.  Some clinics can also incorporate the use of alternative medicine techniques such as <a href=""/acupuncturists"">acupuncture</a> which can be very helpful for some patients.

Please see a pain management specialist soon. Hopefully getting plugged into a pain clinic will help you better manage your symptoms and get back to living your life."
Can taking pain medication for too long damage your liver?,"The answer to your question depends on what type of pain medication you are taking for your <a href=""/procedure/back-problems-122"">back problems</a>.  There are two common classes of medications that cannot be purchased over the counter that can be taken for back pain.  First is the narcotic class.  These include medications such as oxycodone (Percocet), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and morphine.  There are undesirable side effects of these, but they do not usually damage the liver in a person that starts off with a normal liver.  In the short term they cause sedation and constipation.  In the long term they cause <a href=""/procedure/addiction-substance-abuse-177"">addiction</a> and dependence and often require higher and higher doses over time.  The second class of medications is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  Some of these (such as naproxen and ibuprofen) can be purchased over the counter, but the stronger ones require a prescription.  Over time they can cause problems such as stomach and small intestine ulcers, and even kidney failure.  They are not addictive.  Therefore they should only be used for short stretches to control pain.  

Since you have chronic pain, I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a pain medicine specialist.  This is the type of <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a> most qualified to manage your pain over the long term with as few side effects as possible.  "
Is there any kind of relief for nerve pain?,"It sounds like you have been through some difficult health issues recently.  The best place to start is probably with the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who was involved with your procedures.  I very much understand your reluctance to have another surgery, and hopefully you won't need to. However, it will help to get an assessment of your pain and treatment strategies from the physician involved with the initial surgeries.  Next, it would be a good idea to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to talk about pain management strategies.  There are several medications that can be used to treat neuropathic pain (pain coming from the nerves), and hopefully one of these medications may help provide you some significant relief.  In order to figure out the right medication and dosage for you, it will help to go over your medical history, other active medical conditions, and current medication list with the physician who will be prescribing this medication for you.  In addition, your primary care doctor may also be able to refer you to a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a>.  Pain specialists--as their name implies--use a range of modalities to help treat chronic pain and can be very helpful for patients such as yourself who have a clear source of pain but do not want to pursue additional surgery if possible. Good luck."
Can pain just be all in your head?,"I strong suggest that you go back to see your <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a>. It sounds like the first round of tests didn't turn up much. However, this was a while ago and, since you are still in pain, it is time to talk about the problem again with your doctor and see what together you can come up with. 

There are many potential causes for pain in the leg. Sometimes, the pain is related to an old <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> or to arthritis especially if it is centered around a joint. Sometimes, the pain is caused by damage or inflammation to a nerve, called a neuropathy. Unlike injury or arthritis pain, which tends to be aching, neuropathy tends to cause shooting pains or numbness and tingling in the leg. So, as you can see, the character of the pain symptoms is often very helpful because it can help point your doctor towards any potential causes. 

You are right that sometimes, even after extensive medical testing, no cause for a particular pain can be found. This does not however mean that the pain is 'in your head' - it just means that you have a low pain threshold or some other pain sensing trigger which has not been yet identified. In this case, you may benefit from a chronic pain consultation, which is something that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> can set up. "
What can I do if I have chronic pain?,"Chronic pain is a very common complaint. Unfortunately this is a very complicated issue that is very difficult to treat. As such, it is necessary that your align yourself with a good doctor team. I would recommend you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. If necessary, he or she may refer you to a pain specialist.

The first goal with any pain issue is determining the cause of the pain. There are many pieces of the body that can fail and cause pain. Anything from the skin, muscles, joints, bones, nerves, spinal cord and even brain that can cause pain if there is injury to it. Finally, the mind (different from the brain) can also cause pain. Your doctor appears to believe there is nothing physically wrong with your body. It might be worthwhile to see a <a href=""/urologists"">urologist</a> (a groin specialist) to discuss and confirm this. If confirmed, the mind may be the culprit. There are many people who suffer from pain because of psychological issues. In this case, a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> may be helpful.

Overall, medication is simply one part of chronic pain treatment. Physical therapy can help for biofeedback and body training exercises. Mental therapy can help with strategies to deal with the pain.

Talk to your doctor. This requires some effort to address. Good luck!"
What is pain management and how does it work?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having such persistent trouble with your back. When back pain becomes chronic, I agree with your doctor that a referral to a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management specialist</a> or to a pain clinic is an excellent idea. 

Pain management is a discipline in medicine that is focused on helping people with chronic, incurable pain problems control and cope with their pain. The discipline is multidisciplinary, meaning that you don't just see a doctor but also will likely have the opportunity to interact with a physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> and a counselor. In this way, a comprehensive holistic plan for addressing your pain can be developed. 

Pain management <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctors</a> in particular are skilled in the use of a wide variety of medications for pain control. They are excellent at maximizing function and symptom control while minimizing dependency on potentially addictive medications. They also have access to a wide variety of other pain management techniques, such as biofeedback. nerve stimulation, and the like. 

Working with your pain management doctor, you will be able to better define what your goals for pain control are and come up with a safe and realistic plan to help you live a more rewarding and comfortable life. "
Is acupuncture safe?,"I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with such severe chronic pain. First of all, I would check with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> just to make sure there are no reasons why you could not participate in <a href=""/acupuncturists"">acupuncture</a>. 

For most people, acupuncture is safe. Although there are no studies which have conclusively shown that it is beneficial, there are many patients with chronic pain who have used it and who have found it to be helpful for their pain. It is important to pick a licensed, reputable acupuncture provider. This will make sure that the procedure is safe and sterile. Also reputable acupuncture providers can usually bill to your insurance company, meaning that you may not have to pay full price to have acupuncture sessions. 

You may want also to talk to your primary care doctor about other options that are available to you for treatment of your chronic pain. For example, your doctor may be able to refer you to a chronic pain clinic or to a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a>. Pain clinics are extremely skilled in dealing with chronic pain, and they would probably be very helpful to you as you deal with this problem. 

Good luck!"
Does prescription pain medication cause kidney stones?,"First, I'm sorry that your father developed a dependence on these medicines after his <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>.  It is often very difficult to balance the needs of post-surgical pain management with the risk that the patient will become addicted to the medication.  The good news is that these pain medications do not have very many toxic effects to organs.  Narcotic medications can slow down the bowel and cause constipation, but this is easily reversible when the person goes off the medications.  There is no evidence that these medications can cause <a href=""/procedure/kidney-stones-1004"">kidney stones</a>.  Kidney stones are caused by the accumulation of calcium and other materials in the kidney to form a hard stone called nephrolithiasis.  These stones can pass down through the urinary system, or can just stay in the kidney.  

In order to stay off prescription pain medication, your father needs to have his pain controlled with other means.  If his pain is not controlled, then he is more likely to seek out pain medication to get relief.  This will only worsen his <a href=""/procedure/addiction-substance-abuse-177"">addiction</a>.  Therefore I suggest that he schedule an appointment with a pain medicine specialist.  This type of physician will be able to help your father control his pain without giving him more narcotic medication.  "
How serious is Tietze syndrome?,"It seems like you are addressing several different complaints in your question. Tietze syndrome is a rare form of isolated inflammation involving the joints between the sternum (breast bone), clavicle (collar bone), and ribs. However, this doesn't have anything to do with your pain in your feet. Furthermore Tietze syndrome is usually self resolving, and it would be unlikely for symptoms to continue for 3 years unabated. Finally, Tietze syndrome just causing inflammation of the joints, not the bones themselves, so it would be unlikely to cause your collar bone  to stick out like you are reporting (this could actually just be your normal collarbone anatomy). 

I think you will need the help of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> in order to help sort out what is going on, so I recommend that you touch base with your primary care doctor. There are multiple potential causes of chronic joint and musculoskeletal pain. These include conditions like fibromyalgia as well as numerous rheumatological conditions, like lupus. Your doctor will help you determine whether or not it makes sense to pursue a rheumatological workup or whether attention needs to start being focused on helping you control and manage this chronic pain problem. "
What kind of doctor should I see for pain?,"Pain is a very difficult thing for many reasons. As a patient, it obviously affects your quality of life to a great degree. As a physician, there are so many things that can cause pain that it can be difficult to determine what the source is. Depending on the severity of the pain and any other symptoms that you may be having, your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> is generally an excellent place to start. In your situation, it sounds like your doctor did not make any further referrals. As he or she is the one who knows you best, it is entirely appropriate on your part to ask him or her what the next step should be. Should you meet with a specialist? Start a pain medication? Follow up in a few weeks or if the pain gets worse? Usually your doctor will have considered all of these, and will have made some recommendation. If that did not seem to happen in your case, then it is an important thing to clarify so that you do not suffer needlessly. If your doctor does not make a recommendation, then you can seek further help with either a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management doctor</a> or another physician who can make the appropriate determination if there is a physical basis for your pain. "
why does vicodin hype me up?,"Vicodin is a combination medication with two main components: acetaminophen (the ingredient in Tylenol) and hydrocodone, an ""opioid"" painkiller related to drugs like codeine, oxycodone, morphine and heroin.  The psychoactive or 'head effects"" of vicodin come from the hydrocodone component in the drug.

In general, opioid medications are very effective pain killers, but are thought of as central nervous system depressants, with most common side effects being sleepiness, confusion, and respiratory <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> (decreased desire to breath).  These side effects are more pronounced when mixed with alcohol or other central nervous system depressant medications like benzodiazepines (ativan and valium are common examples), and mixing these medications can produce profound or dangerous side effects like coma or death.

Some individuals have what are called ""paradoxical reactions"" to opioids or other central nervous system depressive medications, leading to excitement or stimulation.  These reactions are more common with smaller doses of the medications, and sound consistent with what you are describing.  The reason for paradoxical reactions is unclear, although it is much more common when mixed with other drugs or in elderly patients.

Vicodin is a medication with many serious side effects, including the effects mentioned above as well as the possibility of liver failure (due to the Tylenol component), and should only be taken when prescribed and monitored by a physician.  If you believe you are having unwanted side effects from Vicodin, you should contact your physician immediately and stop taking the drug until instructed to do otherwise by your <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a>."
Are all plastic surgeries painful?,"Unfortunately, the short answer is that most surgeries involve some amount of pain. There are many ways to decrease the pain, including local and general anesthesia during the procedure and pain medications after the procedure is complete. As a general rule, larger procedures generally tend to involve a greater deal of pain while smaller procedures tend to be less painful. Again, this is a general rule and there are exceptions in both categories. 

Plastic surgery is similar to all other surgeries in that this rule generally holds up. In terms of smaller procedures, things like botox and minimally invasive surgeries generally don't involve as much pain as a large reconstruction flap or anastamosis. The recovery for these procedures are also very different. It is for this reason that you discuss any procedure that you have with your <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> prior to undergoing said procedure. 

Questions like how will the pain be managed prior to, during, and after surgery are all relevant and appropriate questions that you should ask your <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">plastic surgeon</a>. if you are very concerned about postoperative pain, consider being evaluated by a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a> prior to your procedure, they are also very good at controlling your pain after surgery, etc"
Does palliative care make sense for all conditions?,"I am sorry to hear that your grandfather is so ill and has been requiring many medications. To answer your question, it is important to understand what palliative medicine is. During the last century, <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctors</a> began to realize that they could, to some extent, keep people alive for long periods of time even though there was essentially no hope for survival. In order to keep them alive, the patients would often be subjected to numerous procedures that could cause pain, suffering and often were of very little value in improving the quality of life; additionally, they often even did little to improve longevity.

For that reason, there was a call to improve the humanistic element of medicine, and allow people to choose the circumstances under which they could pass away. Palliative medicine became the name of this movement, and it has come to be understood that the goal of palliation is to remove pain without causing more just to extend life. Once a patient is under the care of palliative medicine, in general, aggressive treatments designed to extend life give way to therapies that improve quality of life in the duration. Please speak to your doctor if you believe that these objective are not appropriate or are not being met. "
Is palliative care temporary?,"Palliative care is a term used to describe a field of health care specializing in symptom relief.  <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">Doctors</a> and nurses that specialize in palliative care are very good at knowing how to control someone's pain, nausea, <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>, and any other symptom they may be having.  Palliative care is called in for one of many different reasons.  Sometimes they are called in temporarily to help with pain management when someone has been severely injured.  Very often they are called in when someone is end stage in a disease and the focus of care is switching to comfort.  Palliative care can help make someone more comfortable, more awake, more interactive with family all during a time when they are very sick.  

Palliative care and hospice are not the same thing, but they are related.  Physicians that specialize in hospice also specialize in palliative care.  However, not all palliative care is used in hospice.  Hospice is a service that provides palliative care to patients who are no longer seeking life-prolonging care.  It is an excellent way for very sick people to focus on symptom management, while avoiding the discomfort of painful treatments and hospitalization.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment for your mother with the pain and palliative care specialist that works for the hospice you choose for your mother (if this is the direction you are going).  I think you will be happy with the service they can provide for your mother.  "
When are pain medicine follow ups suggested?,"It is very good news that the medication is helping you with the pain. It is still recommended that you continue to be evaluated by the pain medicine <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a> because it is likely that you will need to titrate your medication dosage to best treat your pain while minimizing the side effects that can be noted with over medication. 

For instance, drowsiness, lethargy, decreased respirations are some of the effects of over medicating with certain pain medications. The pain medicine doctor is the best person to evaluate the type of pain that you are having and what will be the best type of pain medicines to help alleviate that pain. Certain types of pain respond better to different types of pain medications, and so it is important that you discuss the type of pain you are having, the effects you are having from the current medication regimen and what pain symptoms you are still having. 

Generally, pain medicine management is a long term practice because pain is very difficult to treat when it becomes chronic. Discuss these concerns you have with your pain management physician as you feel you need because that will be the best way to adequately manage your pain"
Is a pain medicine consultation required if I used to be an addict?,"Drug <a href=""/procedure/addiction-substance-abuse-177"">addiction</a> is a chronic disease and so as you know, there is always a risk for relapse, especially in the setting as you have described. During wisdom tooth removal, you are given both iv sedation, also known as conscious sedation, as well as local anesthesia around the wisdom teeth prior to the removal of your wisdom teeth. Generally, pain occurs after the removal for approximately three to seven days. During this time, your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> may prescribe some pain medications such as percocet or vicodin to alleviate your pain during these times. 

With a history of addiction, it is recommended that you discuss the removal of your wisdom teeth with a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management specialist</a> as they will be able to monitor you and evaluate you during this time. They may also change the prescription for your pain medications to one of a number of medications that have been specially made to block abuse of these medications by taking them in ways that they were not made to be taken in (such as snorting these drugs). In general, in any setting where there is the possibility of taking pain medications, it is important that you discuss this with a pain management specialist to help you avoid relapse."
Should I visit a pain management physician?,"You have my sympathies.  Tailbone injuries (more specifically tailbone bruises) can be very painful.  They make it difficult to walk and sit down for any length of time.  Another problem with tailbone  bruises is that they consistently take between 2-3 months to heal.  Since your <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> is negative, and you aren't reporting any shooting pain down to your feet, the MRI is unlikely to show anything.  

What I often do in these situations is send my patients to physical therapy.  This helps their lower back joints loose and prevents the low back pain that can result from the tailbone injury.  I also prescribe prescription strength anti-inflammatory drugs for the pain which usually works quite well.  I do not prescribe narcotics, such as oxycodon or vicodin, because the side effects of these medications are worse than the temporary relief they provide.  One service that a pain medicine specialist can provide is a steroid injection.  These <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctors</a> are very adept at placing injections in tricky places which can provide relief in certain circumstances.  

I think it would be very reasonable for you to visit a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management specialist</a>.  After a thorough physical exam, the pain doctor will know if you need any additional imaging.  There there is any entrapment or damage to a nerve suggested on your doctor's exam, then you may benefit from a steroid injection.  I hope you feel better. "
Can integrative medicine help cancer victims?,"First of all, I am very sorry to hear that you are dealing with a diagnosis of cancer and that you have significant pain. 

Controlling pain in people with cancer often requires an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach. Therefore, I would start by talking to the <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctor</a> who is coordinating your care. 

One part of pain control is making sure that the dosages of pain medications that you are taking is adequate. Often these medications have to be adjusted from time to time, and so it may be that the fact that your pain is not in control now means it is time for a dose adjustment. 

On top of this, many patients do find that integrative and alternative medical approaches can be helpful for managing pain. These approaches include aromatherapy, medication, massage, and relaxation techniques among others. All of these approaches work by enhancing a sense of well being, which modifies the body's sensation of pain. 

It is very likely that the center where your cancer is being treated has some integrative or alternative medicine programs there, and that might be an easy way for you to get in and experiment with these therapies to see if they work for you. "
Why does acupressure help a bruise feel less sore?,"Bruises, or medically known as an ecchymosis, is a common condition. We all experience these from time to time. If you have a severe <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> that is not improving or is causing severe pain, I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. In addition, if you feel you experience a significant amount of unexplained or an unusually high number of these than you should see your primary care doctor. 

A bruise feels better when rubbing because the rubbing ""confuses"" the nerves. The brain receives information from the body through a set of nerves. There are nerves that are dedicated to send the brain pain signals, pressure signals, vibration signals, temperature signals and others. When one has a bruise the pain nerves are activated and therefore (through the spinal cord) tell the brain that there is pain in the area of the skin or muscle -- thus we experience the pain. Now if you <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> pressure and or heat and or vibration -- then those signals also go to the brain. These other signals ""crowd"" out the pain signal somewhat -- as they are all going to the same part of the brain that can only handle so much. The ""noise"" dampens out the pain ""signal.""

See your doctor if you have more questions."
Will I undergo pain management therapy after bone metastasis treatment?,"I will answer this question assuming that you are not 248 years old.  If you are that old, I would have to say that you have done well.  Bone metastasis can be a very painful part of the cancer disease.  The treatment for this pain depends on a few factors.  If your cancer has metastasized to one area and this one place is causing you pain, then you may benefit from radiation therapy to that area.  Radiation therapy involves pointing a beam of radiation directly at the cancer cells causing their death.  Radiation in this setting is not a cure, but it can reduce your pain.  If your bone metastasis are at more than a few spots and not treatable with radiation, then you will benefit from opioid pain management.  This is done through your oncologist who may or may not refer you to a pain management group.  It just depends on your oncologist's preference.  Opiods like oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone have all been proven to provide relief from pain in chance patients.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your oncologist right away.  The two of you can discuss your pain, and come up with a strategy that will give you some relief, and restore your quality of life.  "
What is the recovery time after anti-pain stimulator implantation in the spine?,"There is only one person that will be able to answer this question in any kind of accurate manner, and that is the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a> who will be implanting the device. Reviewing the different methods of pain control and implantation are beyond the scope of this article, and so some generalities will be reviewed here. Depending on the type of device that is used, the effects will begin to be felt shortly after the implantation and utilization of the device commence. The recovery from the surgery itself is generally short, but will depend on your specific overall health and other medical conditions. If you are obese, diabetic, and smoking, you will be likely to have a more slow recovery, as all of these are involved in your body's ability to overcome trauma and injury. 

If you notice that your pain is not improving daily, or is getting worse, you should speak to your <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">doctor</a> soon. Otherwise, you should anticipate that your symptoms will improve daily, with some minor variation. Your doctor will provide specifics, and will also be able to help you to be realistic in your expectations with regards to the implantation of this device. Please speak to him or her fully prior to the procedure. "
Is anti-pain stimulator implantation often successful?,"The <a href=""/procedure/implantation-of-fertilized-egg-s-1287"">implantation</a> of an anti-pain stimulator is one of the common, but more aggressive, treatment approaches that may be recommended by your <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management doctor</a>. It might be a good fit for you, but it is not perfect for everyone. Some of the advantages include the ability to decrease the need for other medications and their side effects, as well as a level of feeling that you have control over your symptoms. 

As with any medical condition, however, there are associated risks. One of the greatest risks is that it might not work, which is psychologically problematic as well as the fact that it won't improve your symptoms in any way, obviously. For this reason and others, it is often advisable to speak with another physician in the field who is highly recommended, to make sure that the treatment approach is appropriate. Furthermore, a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> might unearth an alternative approach that you might be more comfortable with. 

Given that you are frightened of the procedure anyway, if you heard from a second specialist that it would be a good step, your peace of mind would likely be enhanced. Please speak to your doctor about your concerns in detail, and consider seeking a second opinion if you don't feel quite right about the procedure. "
"Why is my lower back, and joints in constant pain?","This sounds like a serious issue, and I am sorry that you have not found a good solution so far. I am glad that you are seeing a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management doctor</a>, as that can be very helpful over your life in terms of having the best possible pain management solution. 

I do not know anything about your case or history, but I would also want to make sure that you had been seen by a <a href=""/rheumatologists"">rheumatologist</a>. Many of the complaints you have (pain in various different joints, going on for a long time) may be related to a rheumatologic condition. It would be important to sort this out, if you have not already been worked up by a rheumatologist, because, in addition to pain control, many joint conditions actually have more definitive treatment options that specifically target the source of the pain (inflammation, autoimmune reaction, etc) rather than just treating the pain. 

Of course, I do not know if this is your case, and perhaps you have already been down this road. But, if not, this would be my primary recommendation. You may also want to consider physical therapy and a visit with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>, as those are also both good options for helping you find other ways to deal with chronic pain. "
"Why does this medication give me weird, detailed dreams?","Thousands upon thousands of medications have been engineered to treat the various illnesses that afflict mankind.  While the advent of many modern medicines has brought improved health and improved quality of life to many, the unfortunate reality is that there is no such thing as a totally safe medication.  All drugs have the potential to create unwanted side effects, although some of these are more significant than others.  Generally speaking, medications are considered safe for medical use if their benefit to the patient is greater than the risk posed by their toxicities.

Narcotic medications are prescribed to alleviate pain.  They interact with opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord that affect the perception and transmission of pain signals - this is the basis for their therapeutic effect.  Narcotic medications also have a wide range of negative side effects.  The same opioid receptors in the brain that mediate the therapeutic effect of narcotic medication also are linked to control of the rate at which we breathe.  This is the basis of the most worrisome toxicity narcotic medications - the propensity of these drugs to make people stop breathing with high doses.  These effect are amplified when using other types of medication such as some sedatives, <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> medications, epilepsy medications, and muscle relaxants.  For this reason it is always important to keep all of your healthcare providers up to date on all of the medications you take, because only an experienced physician, such as a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or pain medicine specialist, can decide what combinations of medication are safe.  Other less severe and more common side effects of narcotic medication are constipation, itching, altered level of consciousness (sleepiness), strange or vivid dreams, feeling warm or flushed, and lowered blood pressure.  These side effects generally increase with increasing total doses of narcotic mediation.  Some of these side effects are amplified when taking other medications with similar side effects, particularly effects on the mind and respiratory rate, such as sedatives and some muscle relaxants.  Finally, another adverse effect of all narcotic medications is that they have the potential to generate strong physical and psychological dependence when used for extended periods of time.  

Muscle relaxants are prescribed to relieve <a href=""/procedure/muscle-pain-1024"">muscle pain</a>, stiffness, or spasms.  They constitute a broad category of medications with a wide variety of mechanisms, but some of the more commonly prescribed agents function by influencing neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord that are responsible for controlling resting muscle tone.  The different commonly used muscle relaxants all have unique side effects, so it is difficult to comment on these without knowing the specific medication you have been prescribed.  However, since many muscle relaxants work at the level of the brain and brainstem, most agents have the potential to effect level of consciousness (causing drowsiness), as well as the ability to influence mood and behavior.  As narcotic medications have similar mind altering properties, these effects can be amplified when taking both types of medications.  

Although it is not uncommon to experience strange or vivid dreams when taking potentially mind altering medications, such as narcotics and muscle relaxants, not all side effects and interactions between these medications (or others you may be taking) are so easily noticed.  This is why it is critically important that you follow up in person with a primary care physician or pain medicine specialist who can review all of your medications and determine if they are safe to be taken together.  One of these types of physician will be able to tell you if any side effects or interactions of these drugs are potentially worrisome or if any further tests are needed to evaluate the effect they are having on your body."
Why does my chest and sometimes just my whole body hurt out of no where?,"Random pain that is not caused by any known factor and that is significant enough to make you cry is not something that is normal, and does need to be discussed with a physician soon. The vagueness of the remainder of your question precludes the ability to discuss the problem in more detail, but some common causes of pain will be listed. 

Trauma or a history of trauma can obviously result in pain, and that goes for a history of surgeries or other known medical problems that you might have or have had in your past. Heart problems can be the cause of chest pain in many people, although it is less common in 18 year old people. Medical conditions that are poorly treated can also cause some kinds of pain, including uncontrolled diabetes. Usually these will have other symptoms as well, such as <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, increased urination, changes in your energy level, or other similar complaints. 

There are other causes of pain as well, such as the pain that accompanies serious medical problems that need to be treated immediately, such as unregulated cell growth. Please discuss your symptoms in more detail with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> immediately, and know that spontaneous pain without a known cause can be a serious symptom that you should not delay in having evaluated. "
Why do the back of my knees hurt so much? It's worse after standing still.,"It sounds like you have a very complicated situation.  Knee pain for the most part is fairly straight forward to diagnose.  It seems that you have had a fairly extensive work-up without anything found that could be responsible for your discomfort.  If you pain has not changed over that time, I would not suggest having your knees re-imaged.  I think that a new <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> is unlikely to show anything new, and would just be a source of frustration for you.  Your pattern of pain does not fit the pattern of any particular knee <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, nor are you likely to benefit from any surgery.

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a>.  He or she can take a detailed history of your knee pain and perform a thorough physical exam.  It is possible that you have developed a chronic pain syndrome known as neuropathic pain.  Neuropathic pain is pain that you perceive, but is not do to any tissue injury that can be picked up on imaging.  There are special medications that can be tried for this type of pain.  These medicines are different from the classic analgesics that you have probably tried in the past.  Hopefully, you can get some relief soon.  "
Does all spinal pain require a discogram?,"There is a broad differential diagnosis associated with low back pain, and performing a discogram is only one method out of a multitude of tests that can be done to identify the underlying cause. During a discogram, a dye is injected within the disc that is considered to be the pain causing culprit. If the pain you normally experience is similar or exacerbated during the injection, and the x-rays done after the procedure show that there is a tear within the outer covering of the disc (known as the annulus), then this may guide the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> in planning for a surgical intervention. On the other hand, there are many other tests that may be done prior to having a discogram that can give a great deal of information as well. Also, a trial of steroids, epidural injections, physical therapy, anti spasm medications, <a href=""/acupuncturists"">acupuncture</a> and massage therapy may be a good place to see if nonsurgical methods to treat your back pain may be of some help. The risks, benefits, and complications associated with discograms are beyond the scope of this discussion, and it is recommended that you discuss this procedure further with your pain management specialist or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>."
Can oxycontin cause nausea?,"Nausea is a common side effect of narcotic pain medications, such as oxycontin.

The reaction is typically difficult to predict, as different people have different reactions to different pain medicines.  The good news is that a change in medicine (to another, equally powerful narcotic) may be able to remedy the nausea.  Typically, physicians can try continuous release oxycodone (known as oxycontin) or continuous release morphine (known as MS contin).  Having nausea with one medicine does not necessarily mean you will have it with the other.

If you still have nausea with an alternative medicine, and you are still requiring the narcotic, your physician may be able to <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> a medication to control the nausea.

In the end, it is probably an interaction between the medicine and your IBS, and it may not be possible to tease out any further details.  By working with you to develop a therapeutic plan that treats your pain, reduces your nausea, and keeps you from getting constipated (another common narcotic side effect), your physician should be able to help you through this acute injury.

In the future, it will be worthwhile to recall which combinations of medicines works for you, so you can avoid this discomfort should you need these medicines again."
What causes neck spasms?,"Neck spasms can be from a variety of causes.

Most seriously, trauma to the bones or muscles of the neck can cause spasm of the supporting musculature.  Any history of neck trauma should be taken very seriously and should be seen by a physician as soon as possible.  If there is any associated numbness or weakness in the arms or legs, prompt evaluation should be sought.

Among older patients, degenerative disc disease or osteoarthritis of the cervical spine can cause weakness of the muscles supporting the neck and spine.  In their weakened state, these muscles often tend to go into spasm simply secondary to supporting the weight of the head.  These conditions should first be evaluated by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, as they can often be improved with anti-inflammatory medicines or physical therapy.  If more severe, the patient can be seen by a orthopedic spine <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a> with a specialty in spine.

Most commonly, strain from repetitive use (recent athletic activity, work-related activity that requires constant bending or turning of the neck) can lead to spasms.  General emotional stress has been linked to muscle spasm, as has poor sleep.  Attention should be paid to sleep hygiene, namely duration and regularity of sleep, as well as neck position during sleep."
What is TMJ?,"If you are having headaches, I encourage you to speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. While headaches can have many non-serious causes, there are a few concerning causes that should be ruled out and therefore discussing chronic headaches with a physician is important.

TMJ refers to the temporomandibular joint. It is actually two joints in one. The temporal bone is part of the skull located around the temple, around the ear. The mandible is the jaw bone. Therefore the TM joint is the place where the jaw connects to the head. When people say TMJ, they are referring to TMJ syndrome--which is inflammation of the joint. Symptoms of TMJ syndrome include headaches over the temple, hearing changes, pain with jaw movement and sometimes even clicking and popping of the joint. The cause of TMJ syndrome is most commonly overuse, which can be caused by teeth misalignment. Therefore orthodontics, mouth guards and even jaw splints can help. Other causes of TMJ syndrome include autoimmune disease, trauma or cancers. Depending on the cause of TMJ syndrome, your doctor may prescribe different treatments including pain pills, injections and sometimes <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>. 

Talk to your primary doctor. TMJ syndrome can be treated, but the first thing to make sure that this is actually the cause."
"Constant headache since April 12, 2012","Thank you for providing rather good information, and I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from these repeated headaches. Unfortunately, <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a> can be a frustrating problem for both <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> and patients due to the inability to completely diagnose it and occasionally treat it. It does sound like you have done a good job of speaking with your doctors about your symptoms – which you should continue to do – and you have had what appears to be a very thorough workup. The most important value, based on what you have told me thus far, is the fact that your imaging, including both CT and <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a>, is essentially normal (at least, that is what you are implying in your message). While both polyps and Cspine narrowing could cause your problem, that is unlikely based on how you share the story. The fact that you are having wide spread symptoms, including vision changes and nausea/vomiting, makes me suspect that you are having migraines. This would be even more likely if anyone in your family has migraines or if you feel that the light hurts when you have these headaches. Regardless, there are things that help to treat these problems, and I suggest that you speak with your doctor about your symptoms and how to relieve them. "
"I have a headache and tingling feelings on right calf, foot, fingertips, and lower arm. Why?","If these are new symptoms for you then you should definitely seek medical attention right away.  A new and severe <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a> accompanied by sensory changes can sometimes indicate that part of your brain is not getting enough oxygen.  This can be related to a transient ischemic attack (or TIA), a stroke, or even bleeding from one of the blood vessels in the brain.  There are many other less worrisome causes of sensory deficits and a headache, including some kinds of <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> headaches, but without a thorough history, evaluation of your past medical history and medications, and an exam including a complete neurological exam, it is impossible to determine exactly what might be causing your symptoms. Depending upon the results of your physical exam and history your physician may want to do additional laboratory testing, imaging of your brain, or possibly even a procedure such as a lumbar puncture.

If you have a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, you should speak with his or her office right away about scheduling an urgent care visit.  If you have not had regular follow-up care with a physician then you may have to go to the emergency department for an initial evaluation and then establish care with a new primary care physician following this appointment.  "
Why am I in so much pain after sagittal sinus thrombosis if the clot has gone?,"That sounds like a very unfortunate series of complaints. You are suffering from a very debilitating condition, as you know, and it is important to continue to have regular follow-up with your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> to make sure that you can return to your optimal health. That being said, there is a percentage of patients who will continue to suffer some degree of symptoms for a prolonged period even after the clot has resolved. While it would be important to know more of your story to accurately tell you anything, it is likely that you will continue on some blood thinners for some time. Your symptoms will hopefully continue to improve as the other clots break up, but I am not sure that anyone would be able to tell you that for sure. There are occasions when the nerves can be injured or sensitized that can make people prone to pain or abnormal sensations for a prolonged period. At this point, it will be most important to continue to work with your doctors and follow the course of the clots, and please speak with him or her regarding your questions. It may also be important for you to work with physical or <a href=""/occupational-medicines"">occupational therapists</a> as you seek to return to your former level of health. Good luck!"
What are the side effects of Topamax?,"This is a great question for your daughter's <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor. Topamax is an effective medication for several different disorders, including certain types of seizure disorders. However, like all of the anti seizure medications, Topamax can have several different types of side effects. Most people who take Topamax experience some side effects, and it is important to work with your daughter's primary care doctor and neurologist to manage these. 

Most of the common side effects from Topamax are not serious and will tend to get better after a few weeks of taking the medication as the body gets used to the medication. These side effects include things like dizziness and sleepiness, changes in appetite, numbness or tingling, and abnormal vision. More rare and important side effects include changes in the blood counts and kidney stones. One very rare but very serious side effect from Topamax is something called Stevens Johnson syndrome, which is a life threatening skin rash. Because of the risk of Stevens Johnson syndromes, most doctors will start the Topamax at a low dose and raise it slowly, telling the patient to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a new skin rash.

How can my dad cope with multiple sclerosis?,"<a href=""/procedure/multiple-sclerosis-234"">Multiple sclerosis</a>, or any chronic, progressive, and debilitating condition, can be terrifying when first diagnosed, bringing fear and uncertainty into what had previously been plans and dreams of relaxation or enjoyment in the later years. Fortunately, there are more and more treatment options for many of these conditions that make them much more tolerable and can take much of the fear out of the future, so it’s important for your father to discuss his options with his <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a>. One of the most important things is what you already suggested: good support. Family and friends being near and working together to provide needed support are vital to having the best outcome.

Fortunately, with some of the new medications that are available, multiple sclerosis is becoming a condition that can be managed quite well. Many patients are able to continue on with a high degree of normalcy, and learn quickly when a medication dose should be adjusted or changed based on any new symptoms. In short, coping comes with learning more about the disease and what may happen, and then tempering that with a realization that you have more control over the future than you think you do.

Work closely with your doctor, see specialists as needed, and visit support groups to find out more about what the future may bring."
How will cerebral atrophy and ventriculomegaly affect my wife?,"As the brain ages, there does tend to be loss of some of the brain's volume over time. This can lead to what is known as age-related cerebral atrophy, with a corresponding increase in size of the ventricles. This may be all that is going on in your wife's case and, if she is asymptomatic, this may not require anything more than regular followup with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your geriatrician. In other words, there are many elderly people who have findings like this but lead completely normal lives. 

On the other hand, if your wife has neurological symptoms, such as trouble with memory or performing daily functions, then this might be a stronger indication that her cerebral atrophy is affecting her. In this case, once again, the first step would be to discuss the results with her primary care doctor to decide what to do. There are many different medical problems that can accelerate these degenerative changes in the brain, such as frequent strokes, and the treatment plan might focus primarily on controlling these other medical issues. If there is any evidence of early <a href=""/procedure/dementia-501"">dementia</a> or other cognitive impairment, than medications directed at that problem might be appropriate. "
What is causing my headaches and nausea around my period?,"I recommend seeing a <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> about this issue. Many people will experience headaches. One of the most common, and potentially most debilitating, kinds of headaches is a <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a>. The keys that <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> look for to determine if you have a migraine is if you are sensitive to light (i.e., you just want to go lie down in a dark room until it passes), it is incapacitating (meaning that you are unable to focus on anything else), and if you have nausea. What you describe may point to migraines. Migraines are very problematic, and often run in families. If you have them, it is a good possibility that you have a sibling or parent who had them as well. They also will commonly be affected by hormonal changes, and many women will feel that they have migraines more in association with their menstrual cycle and the changes that they go through on a monthly basis. If you are having bad headaches regularly, you should speak with a doctor about treatment options. There are many things that can be done to improve your quality of life, and it is important to make sure there is nothing else causing them. Book an appointment today!"
Do I have Multiple Sclerosis?,"I recommend that you make an appointment with a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> to discuss this issue. Multiple sclerosis, as you probably know from your research on the internet, is a condition in which the insulating myelin sheath around nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord breaks down. This can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including some of those you mention, such as areas of numbness and tingling, weakness, and tremors. Classically, multiple sclerosis is a cyclical condition, in the sense that symptoms may tend to get better and then worse from time to time. 

It does sound like you have a very complex medical history. Some of your symptoms may be compatible with multiple sclerosis. However, you have other conditions which might be causing some of your symptoms, including the osteoid tumor in your back, and your depression. 

I do think a visit with a neurologist is a good idea. If they suspect multiple sclerosis, they will probably want to get an MRI of the brain to confirm or rule out that diagnosis. In the meantime, however, I think that working with your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor or other regular doctors on some of your other medical issues, especially the back pain and the depression, would be a good idea, as those conditions are no doubt contributing to the overall picture."
How can I treat a headache?,"Any persistent headache like this that does not get better after a few days really needs to be evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. 

There are several different causes of headache that is persistent. A few of these are rare but also very serious, such as a brain tumor. The first thing your doctor will do is perform a thorough neurological exam to make sure you do not have any evidence of these serious causes. If there is any concern after the neurological exam, they will probably want to get an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of the brain to rule things out. 

Assuming that your neurological exam is normal, then the two most common causes of persistent headache are tension headache and <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> headache. These two types of headache typically have different patterns, which can usually be teased out by your doctor. It is important to make the distinction, because the two types of headache are generally treated quite differently. For example, tension headaches often respond to changes in lifestyle (sleeping better, exercising more) and painkillers. Migraine headaches, on the other hand, may require a daily medication to reduce the frequency and severity of the headache attacks or specialized medications to 'break' the headache.

Make an appointment with your doctor today. I hope you’re feeling better soon!"
Could a warm sensation in my arm when holding something warm be a symptom of CIDP?,"CIDP, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, can present with many different symptoms. In addition, patients with CIDP can develop new symptoms at any time, and symptoms can wax and wane. 
Common symptoms associated with CIDP include muscle weakness, as well as numbness, <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a>, or pain in various parts of the body. 

The fact that you've developed a new symptoms of a strange warm sensation in your arm may or may not be related to CIDP. There are other conditions that could cause this sensation, including run of the mill musculoskeletal pain. However, it is something that is definitely worth keeping an eye on, and I would recommend that you mention it to your <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. 

If you notice that this symptom becomes much more severe or if you develop any other new symptoms, such as weakness, you should also let your neurologist know about that right away as well. 

Sometimes, it can be difficult even for your neurologist to tell whether a symptom is related to your CIDP or not. In many cases, several office visits and repeated neurological examinations may be necessary to sort out subtle symptoms like this one. "
What could cause constant lights in one eye?,"There are several different possibilities here, and I can make some general recommendations about different types of doctors that should be involved in helping you figure this out if they are not already. 

First, the fact that you have had a CT scan is excellent and reassuring, because it rules out many of the more serious causes of your symptoms, such as a large tumor in the brain. However, a CT scan is not the most definitive imaging study of the brain and so, if there are still questions, an MRI of the brain might not be a bad thing to consider. 

It will also be important to have a full eye examination by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye </a><a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a>, if you have not done this already, as several diseases in the eye, such as a tear or hole in the retina or a buildup of pressure inside the eye, could cause symptoms like flashing lights. 

Also, consulting with a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> would be a good idea, especially if all of the brain imaging and the eye examination are unrevealing. The neurologist will be able to consider and rule out the various neurological conditions, such as migraine, that could be contributing to your various symptoms. 

Good luck! "
What kind of doctor should I see if I feel shaky and weak?,"I'm sorry that this has been such an persistent issue for you and that you haven't found a clear answer for your symptoms. 

It does sound like you have had a pretty thorough work up, most of which has come back completely normal. Investigating for the common nutritional causes of neurological problems (like iron and B12 deficiency) was a great idea, as was ruling out hyperthyroidism with the TSH test. After all of this, the next move to go see the <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> was also appropriate, and the appropriate testing was performed, since the EMG/nerve conduction studies would have ruled out all the major serious additional neurological or muscular problems. 

Therefore, at this point, you may unfortunately be dealing with an essential or idiopathic tremor, meaning that no clear cause is identified. These are actually pretty common. I wouldn't continue to pursue additional specialists just yet, as those are probably not going to turn up much more at this point.   It seems like the best bet would be to sit down with the primary <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> and the neurologist that you already know and get their opinion on how best to treat this tremor and whether they feel additional testing is needed."
Is there a doctor that specializes in muscles?,"I would suggest that you start by going back to see the <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a> or back surgeon who performed the original surgery on your spine. It is absolutely imperative to make sure first of all that the surgery has healed well and that there have been no complications leading to additional loss of muscle strength. 

If your neurosurgeon feels that everything is well, then it might just be that you have continue weakness in your arm either because the damage to the pinched nerve was severe and permanent or because you simply have lost a lot of ground and need help with recovery through therapy. Most likely, the best strategy will be to have an intensive physical therapy regimen, which is something that your neurosurgeon (or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>) should be able to set up for you easily. Chronic disuse of muscles (either from immobility or from poorly functioning nerves) leads to loss of muscle mass and weakness. This can often be at least partially reversed if you work intensely with a <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> and develop a regimen of daily exercises targeted specifically at the weakened muscle groups. 

Please make an appointment with your doctor today, and make sure to ask them about getting in to see a physical therapist. "
Constant burning for 7 months?,"I strongly suggest that you circle back with your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> about these symptoms. It is encouraging that your most recent tests of thyroid function (TSH) are within normal limits, which makes hyper or hypothyroidism much less likely to be the cause of your symptoms. Furthermore, it is encouraging that the <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a> of your brain is normal, as that rules out many major causes, such as a large brain tumor. 

However, you still have some serious symptoms that need to be defined and chased down. The burning and pins and needles sensations all suggest a nerve source for your symptoms, as these are the ways that people with ""neuropathy"" typically describe their symptoms. ""Neuropathic pain"" can be caused by damage or inflammation in the peripheral nerves running throughout the body; this typically occurs in chronic medical conditions like diabetes, but can also be caused by a wide range of less common factors, including medication side effects. Neuropathic pain may also be a sign of something going on inside the brain. Although a CT scan rules out some things, it does not rule out more subtle diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, which would require an MRI scan. 

I would start by booking an appointment with a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>, if you do not already have one, as they will be best able to help you figure out what might be going on. "
Is vascular dementia always followed by microvascular ischemic brain disease diagnosis?,"Microvascular ischemic brain disease is a condition in which many tiny strokes accumulate in the deep structures of the brain. These tiny strokes are usually caused by chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. The problem tends to occur in elderly people who have had these conditions for quite a while. Therefore, given the fact that you are a diabetic and that you are 70 years old, the scenario definitely fits. 

As the small strokes accumulate, this can lead to impairment in memory and other higher brain functions. When this level of impairment becomes significant, it is called ""vascular dementia."" The fact that you are having trouble paying bills and remembering important things is definitely a warning sign. I would strongly recommend that you talk with a <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> about this issue, either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. 

Your doctor, in addition to performing a complete physical examination, may want to perform some tests of your mental functioning to determine how severe the impairment is. Some of these tests may be done in the office, but your doctor may also want to refer you for more extensive, formal neuropsychiatric testing. These results will help them decide how best to treat your symptoms. "
Should I be worried about headaches I am getting in the middle of the night? ,"I am very sorry to hear that you are having such terrible problems with headaches! Unfortunately headaches after neurosurgical procedures, such as surgery on the pituitary gland, can be a common complication. Usually these are limited to the immediate period of recovery after the surgery, but they can sometimes become chronic and require chronic headache treatments by a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. So, in general, I think your doctor's plan of getting a neurology consult to help you deal with the headaches is a good one. 

I do agree with you, though, that worsening headaches, especially that wake you up in the middle of the night, are very concerning, and I also would want to rule out a recurrence of the tumor. This is an issue that you should talk to your <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a> about, since they know your case better than anyone else. I suggest that you call them on the phone, or set up an urgent visit, so that you can explain better how severe your headaches have become and get their opinion on whether or not you need to have a repeat imaging study of the brain to rule out a tumor. 

I hope that you get some answers and are feeling better soon!"
I have a droopy eyelid and slight pain. What is this?,"It sounds like you have had a good initial workup of your droopy eyelid, which is known in medical terminology as ptosis. Have a CT scan and an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> scan of the head rule out some of the more serious causes of ptosis, such as a tumor in the brain pressing on the nerve that controls the eyelid. That is all very good news. 

However, given that you still do not have a diagnosis for why you have ptosis, it is important to have good followup with a <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> to determine what additional workup you might need. I would recommend going back to see the doctor who order the initial scans, as they will know your case best. It might also be necessary to involve a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> at this point, if you have not done so yet. 

There are many causes of ptosis. Some of them are fairly benign, and include things like a viral infection causing inflammation of the nerve. There are also various causes, such as myasthenia gravis or thyroid disease, that could be diagnosed with additional blood tests or physical examination. Occasionally, ptosis can be a sign of Horner's syndrome which can be caused by tumors or other conditions in the neck or chest pressing on nerve roots. 

Make an appointment with your doctor today!"
"I recently have had an increase of ""kinks"" in my neck and migraines. Should I be seen?","I strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> as soon as possible. These symptoms are concerning, and they need to be investigated right away. 

Any time a known headache pattern changes or is accompanied by new symptoms (in this case, for example, tingling in your arm) it is important to rule out a serious medical problem, such as a brain tumor, causing the new symptoms. This requires at a minimum a thorough physical examination by your doctor, and it may also require additional studies, such as an MRI of the brain. 

Assuming this examination and/or studies are normal, it may be that you are just having a worsening of your <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> pattern, with associated aura (tingling in the arm, black spots in front of your eye). If so, it may be time to think about starting a prophylactic medication to decrease the severity and frequency of the migraines. There are many medications that are used for this indication, and your primary care doctor or your neurologist will be able to discuss the various options and help you decide what to do. 

Set up a doctor appointment right away, and I hope that you are feeling better soon!"
How serious is microvascular ischemic brain disease?,"Microvascular ischemic brain disease is a fancy medical term for saying that you have suffered multiple tiny strokes throughout your brain. This is a common problem in people who have lots of complex medical problems like you do, such as diabetes and <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>. 

Unfortunately, the damage from the microvascular brain disease is not curable or reversible, although that does not mean there is nothing you can do. First, you can continue to work on physical therapy and rehabilitation, which will help to return you to as high a level of functioning as possible. Second, you can control the medical problems that contribute to developing future strokes. In particular, keeping your cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood pressure tightly controlled is critical to preventing future events. 

You should discuss this plan and your concerns with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will want to see you every few months to make sure that these conditions are under control and that you are taking your medications as indicated without any problems. Good luck!"
Why do I get lightheaded/dizzy whenever I stand up?,"You should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about these issues, if you have not done so already. <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">Dizziness</a> is one of the most common medical problems, but any time that the dizziness is persistent and recurrent, such as in your case, it needs to be evaluated. 

The first task your doctor will have is to rule out any serious causes of the dizziness, such as a problem with your heart or with your brain. Make sure to mention to them if you have any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness with exercise, severe headaches, or trouble with coordination. Also mention any family history of brain tumors or heart disease. Based on a complete cardiovascular and neurological examination, they may recommend additional testing to rule out these serious problems. 

If the examination is normal and this initial testing is also negative, it will be necessary to investigate other possibilities. Most common is vaso-vagal dizziness, which occurs when blood pools in the legs; it can usually be controlled by staying well hydrated and avoiding changing positions quickly, although sometimes medications are required. There are other autonomic conditions which can result in blood pooling as well, but these are rare in someone your age. 

Depending on what they find, your primary care doctor may also wish to refer you to a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. "
"Every time I get up from sitting down, I nearly black out and get dizzy.","You should definitely go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue as soon as possible. <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">Dizziness</a> and near <a href=""/procedure/fainting-syncope-1052"">fainting</a> can sometimes be a a sign of a serious medical problem, and it always needs to be checked out. 

The fact that the symptoms always seem to occur when you are changing positions is somewhat reassuring, because it makes pooling of blood in your legs the most likely cause of the symptoms. This is the most benign cause of the symptoms, which can often be treated just by staying really well hydrated and by changing positions closely. Sometimes, however, dizziness with changing positions can be a sign of a more persistent dysfunction of the nerves which control the tone in your blood vessels, especially if you have diabetes or another reason to have chronic nerve dysfunction. 

Your doctor will also want to make sure that this is not a problem with your heart, especially given the palpitations that you sometimes report feeling. To do this, they will definitely want to check an electrocardiogram, and they may also want some additional heart testing. 

Finally, they will perform a complete neurological examination to make sure that this is not a problem with your central nervous system.

Go see your doctor right away!"
I have numbness in my hands and feet that started approx 3 weeks ago. Why?,"I'm very sorry to hear that you are going through this stressful time! I agree with your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> so far that Guillain Barre syndrome is high on the list of possibilities. Basically, this is a condition in which the nerves in the periphery of the body get inflamed, generally as a result of some sort of viral infection, although there can be other triggers as well. The spinal tap you had done is also consistent with Guillain Barre syndrome, because in Guillain Barre there tends to be an isolated elevation of the protein levels in the spinal fluid. The hives/rash that you have might also be consistent, because many viral infections that trigger Guillain Barree might also trigger this kind of localized skin reaction.  The symptoms of Guillain Barre do include numbness and <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a> and muscle weakness. The symptoms tend to get worse before they get better, and they tend to ascend the limbs. Therefore, being in a safe place such as the hospital is a great environment to be in, because your doctors will be able to follow you closely to see how your symptoms are doing. Input from a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> would be very helpful, I think, if you have not had a consultation with one yet. "
Microvascular ischemic brain disease?,"Microvascular ischemic brain disease means that, on the MRI scan that you had done, the <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> who read the scan probably saw multiple tiny areas where small amounts of brain tissue had been damaged. These small areas of brain damage are usually from tiny strokes that occur when the small blood vessels become occluded. Unfortunately, this is a problem that is commonly associated with people with chronic medical problems like high blood pressure, diabetes, and prior strokes. 

To guarantee the best possible prognosis, it is really critical to control your diabetes and other risk factors. Your primary care or <a href=""/internists"">internal medicine doctor</a> can help you do this, and so having regular appointments with them for medication adjustments is the way to go. Also, since you have a history of stroke in the past, it is important to have regular followup with your <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>, who can determine whether any medications are needed. 

Although it is not possible to fix the areas of the brain that have already been damaged by these tiny strokes, the goal would be to prevent accumulation of new areas of ischemia through the optimization of your medications and the control of our medical problems. Again, please talk to your doctor about your concerns!"
I have been getting constant headaches. What should I do?,"You need to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or your <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a> right away to help figure out what is going on. Any persistent headache like this needs to be evaluated, both to ensure adequate treatment and also to make sure nothing serious is going on. 

Your doctor will perform a complete physical examination, because they will first want to rule out rare but serious causes of headache, such as a brain tumor. 

Assuming the physical examination is relatively normal, then there are several common types of headaches that your doctor will consider. This include both tension headaches and <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> headaches. Additionally, headaches can be associated with nasal allergies or sinus congestion. Finally, there is a type of headache called analgesic headache which is, interestingly enough, caused by taking lots of medication for headache!

Based on what your doctor discovers, they will recommend treatment. If the headache is caused by migraine or tension headache, they will be able to prescribe the appropriate medication to prevent or relieve your symptoms. If the headache is from allergies or sinus congestion, they can prescribe medications to help open up your nasal passages and drain your sinuses. 

Please make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. "
Should my mother be tested after her fall?,"Your mother should see her <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a>.

There are certain tools that <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> use to help predict if someone with a head injury should undergo imaging of the head (usually with <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a>). These include consideration of the mechanism of injury, age greater than or equal to 65 years old, use of blood-thinning medications, signs suggesting a skull fracture on exam, altered mental status, and vomiting, to name a few. 

It is certainly not uncommon for someone to experience forgetfulness or other signs of concussion following head trauma. Not all of these people will need head imaging to rule out some bad consequence of the trauma (such as a subdural bleed). However, given the risk of bleeding after head trauma and the development of new symptoms, it is very important that your mother be re-evaluated by her doctor. Her doctor can conduct a very thorough physical exam, paying particular importance to her neurologic exam, testing cranial nerves, mental status, gait, etc. If any of these tests are abnormal, then follow-up head imaging with CT scan can be performed to rule out an intracranial bleed. "
Is it a bad idea to take a narcotic pain killer if you might have a concussion?,"Your instinct here is very good, that you should not give your pain medication to your friend. Generally speaking, any strong pain medications should be prescribed directly by a physician and should only be taken by the person for whom they are prescribed. It is never a good idea to take some one else's prescription medications. 

<a href=""/procedure/concussion-1462"">Concussion</a> can be a serious issue, because it can cause lingering problems such as headache, nausea, and dizziness that can take a long time to resolve. In this setting, it is often necessary to take medications for pain or for the other symptoms. Opiates like percocet might not be entirely out of the question in this situation, but they should only be taken if your friend's <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> agrees that this is the best approach. 

It also sounds like your friend needs to work with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> anyway on this back pain issue, so one thing you could do is suggest to her that she make a followup appointment to deal both with the issue of the concussion as well as with the back pain. Since her primary care doctor knows her better than any other doctor, they will be well qualified to help her figure out which medications she should be taking. "
"Every night my daughter who is 9 has nausea and sometimes vomits, she also gets headaches. Why?","This sounds like a very complex case that requires the input of a good specialty pediatrics team to help sort out what might be going on. Not knowing the specific details of the case, the combination of nightly nausea and headaches is concerning to me, because these symptoms together require ruling out a serious neurological problem, such as a tumor in the brain. Since your daughter has seen a lot of doctors, I suspect  that this possibility has already been ruled out but, if not, this would be something to talk to your daughter's <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about. 

It also sounds like there is room for your neurologist to weigh in on the other symptoms regardless. For example, topamax and phenobarbital are medications that are commonly used for migraine headaches and seizure problems, and it is possible that your daughter's symptoms are related either to need to play around with these medication doses. If the headaches are poorly controlled, the medications may need to be adjusted up; alternatively, nausea and headache can also sometimes be a sign of too high a dose. 

I would also followup with your daughter's <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> to see if additional lab work or other testing needs to be done to rule out a gastrointestinal component here. "
Is this permanent concussion damage?,"I am sorry to hear that your mother is dealing with all of these issues. Concussion, as you probably know by now, is a type of injury to the brain that occurs usually after a fall or a blow to the head. Although most people who suffer from a concussion do go on to a full recovery, some people do not. Numerous symptoms of concussion, including chronic headaches and <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, can go on for months to years in some people and, in fact, may never entirely resolve. 

I would recommend that your mother make sure to see a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> specialized in the treatment of patients suffering from severe or chronic effects of concussion. They will be able to give you a better sense of her over all chances of making a recovery, and they will also be able to help you come up with a plan for treating the symptoms. 

Also it would be good to have a full checkup with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Some of the symptoms you mention, such as high blood pressure, are unlikely to be caused by the concussion, and so it is important to look for and rule out other causes of her symptoms. "
My head hurts. Why?,"I would strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible. Any persistent severe headache like this really needs to be checked out by your doctor to make sure there is nothing serious going on and also to help figure out what treatment might relieve your pain. 

There are several different types of headaches that your doctor will consider. These include tension headaches and migraine headaches. Additionally, there is a type of headache known as analgesic headache, which is caused by taking large doses of Advil and other similar medications for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, since you have a lot of pain in the back of your neck, it will be important to rule out <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> or another problem in your spine as a cause of the pain. 

Rarely, headaches can be a sign of a very serious problem such as a brain tumor. Make sure to mention to your doctor if you have any other symptoms, such as visual disturbances, nausea, dizziness , or <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>. 

After a thorough examination, your doctor will help you decide whether or not you need additional testing, such as imaging studies or bloodwork.

Why does the left side always feel different than the right side of my body?  ,"I am not sure exactly what to make of this symptom. Everyone experiences their body in slightly different ways, and it is possible that your brain has simply adapted cues from the two sides if your body in these subtle ways, such that the two sides of your body don't feel exactly the same. If the sensation has been stable since early childhood then, as you say, it is unlikely to be related to the <a href=""/procedure/multiple-sclerosis-234"">multiple sclerosis</a>. 

This is not to say that multiple sclerosis cannot produce some very strange symptoms indeed! Some of these symptoms could include all sorts of sensations like coolness, <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a>, tingling, etc in different parts of the body. Therefore, you should definitely discuss these symptoms with your <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>, as they could definitely be part of a multiple sclerosis pattern. 

Good luck!"
"The bottoms of my feet hurt all the time, feels like im walking on prickly things. Why?","This sounds like you be experiencing some neuropathy, which involves pain, numbness, tingling, or other strange sensations that result from damage to nerves in the body. Symptoms like this are concerning, and they need to be checked out by your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> right away, especially if you have never mentioned this issue to them. Start by seeing either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>, if you have one. 

There are many potential causes for neuropathy, and some of them are serious and require treatment. For example, diabetes is a very common cause of neuropathy and, although unusual for neuropathy to be the first presenting symptoms of diabetes, this can occur. Similarly, multiple nutritional problems, such as vitamin or iron deficiency may cause neuropathy symptoms. Other chronic diseases and infections, such as HIV infection or liver disease, can also be associated with neuropathy, as can certain drugs and toxins. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a complete physical examination looking for causes of your symptoms. In addition to the physical examination, they will probably want to perform some basic blood work and, depending on what these tests show, they may decide to refer you for additional specialized nerve testing. 

Good luck!"
Why do I feel weak and lightheaded in the morning?,"I would say that your symptoms are definitely not normal! I highly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or the <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> who is prescribing your epilepsy medications about this issue. 

There are many potential causes of the fatigue and dizziness, some of them potentially serious. At the top of the list in my mind for your case would be an overdose or a side effect of the medications you are taking for epilepsy. Your doctor can evaluate your dose and potential for these symptoms being a side effect. Depakote exists as a blood test, so your doctor could potential check your blood level of that medication to make sure it is not too high. 

There are other things that need to be ruled out as well, for example a heart problem or a different neurological problem. Make sure to mention to your doctor if you have any other concerning symptoms such as visual changes, <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, trouble with coordination, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, or leg swelling as these could all be important clues to what is going on. 

Contact your doctor right away and set up an appointment to be evaluated as soon as is possible!"
What is chronic microvascular ischemic change of the brain?,"Chronic microvascular ischemic changes in the brain are often picked up incidentally on a scan of the brain, most typically an MRI. What they are is small areas in the brain where tiny blood vessels have ruptured or clotted off causing, essentially, extremely small areas of strokes. Most commonly, chronic microvascular ischemic changes are associated with chronic health problems, especially <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, high cholesterol, and diabetes. A very high percentage of older adults with long standing problems with these conditions will have this finding on an MRI scan. 

It is hard to know exactly what the significance of the findings are, however, in your case without knowing more about the reasons why you had the brain scan in the first place. Certainly chronic microvascular changes can build up over time and lead to cognitive and other neurological deficits and so, if these are the symptoms you are experiencing, then they could certainly be explanatory. However, you will need to discuss the situation in detail with the <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> who ordered the study to see what they think.

Also, the findings are a good indication that you need to make sure your other medical problems, like those I mentioned above, are under good control, something that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> can help you with. Please see him or her soon!"
What does this EMG summary table mean?,"EMG testing is a special type of testing that is done by certain <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologists</a> to look for evidence of problems with electrical conduction or activity in nerves or muscles. It is typically performed when there are symptoms that such as pain, numbness, or weakness that could be consistent with a medical condition involving damage to either a muscle or nerve. 

Given the location of your symptoms, namely pain in the left hand and forearm, your doctors would have been looking for common causes of this type of pain. Most commonly, this is <a href=""/procedure/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-1090"">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, which involves pressure on or inflammation of the median nerve running down the wrist. Other conditions, such as diabetes, can also cause these kinds of symptoms occasionally. 

Your report shows polyphasic potentials (PPP) in the left abductor pollicis brevis, which is a small muscle that helps with movement of the thumb. The abductor pollicis brevis is a muscle controlled by the median nerve. Therefore, this finding could be consistent with a carpal tunnel syndrome. However, polyphasic potentials are very nonspecific, and they can sometimes be normal even. Therefore, you will need to discuss the findings with the <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> who performed the test to determined whether or not they actually think they are significant. Good luck!"
What can I do for osteonecrosis?,"I am sorry that you have had to suffer from so much pain for such a long time. The pain that comes from a bad joint and the wear and tear on the nerves in the affected region can be unbearable and severely limit your normal activities. I would be interested to know the cause of the destruction of so many of your joints, as you certainly seem to have a very advanced problem in that it involves multiple areas including both upper and lower extremities. While you know that replacements can be very beneficial, you also understand that they, too, are painful, and require a large amount of rehabilitation prior to returning to near normal form. In short, they are not a perfect fix. Depending on your overall health and your future goals, however, they are often the best fit. Speaking with both your orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, your family practice doctor (or gerontologist), and a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain management doctor</a> about your options will likely help you to understand best how you should proceed as they will be able to understand your situation from all angles and be able to advise you correctly about the appropriate expectations. Please speak to your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> about your questions. "
What does it mean when you see flashes of light?,"Sorry to hear that you have been experiencing flashes of light in your eyes, and had a bad headache recently. There are a number of different reasons that people can see ""flashes of light"", most of which are very benign. However, in a few situations ""flashes"" can be the first sign of a much more worrisome process such as retinal detachment. This is why new onset ""floaters"", or ""flashes"" should be evaluated by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> to make sure that there is nothing more sinister going on. My goal is not to scare you, because most people experience ""flashes"" at some point in their life, and they are usually not problematic. The other thing to think about with your recent headache is whether you experienced a visual aura prior to a <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> headache. Classically people that suffer from migraine headaches have a sensation, or ""aura"", prior to actually contracting a headache. And often times these symptoms are visual. They can be anything ranging from bright lights, or ""flashes"", to scotoma (or ""floaters""), to temporary blindness/visual disturbance in one or more eyes. With your myriad of symptoms, it is entirely possible that you had a migraine with visual aura. If this were the case, the best physician to see would be a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. So if you continue to have mainly visual symptoms, I would recommend seeing an ophthalmologist. If the visual symptoms are always followed by a headache, I recommend you get a consultation with a neurologist. Best of luck. "
Why do my fingertips and feet itch so bad?,"There are many things that can cause itching, some of which are simple and have very rapid treatments, others of which can indicate a serious medical problem. Given that there is such wide variation, it is important to know more about you. For example, if this is a very new problem and you have had some recent change in your diet or other habits, it could indicate something as simple as an allergy. Given that this seems to be most prominent in your distal extremities, however, I would be worried that this could be something more. Without knowing more about you, I would be concerned that you could be suffering from some type of <a href=""/procedure/peripheral-neuropathy-carpal-tunnel-1460"">peripheral neuropathy</a>. Neuropathy is the medical term <a href=""/neurologists"">doctors</a> use to describe nerve <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> or death. When nerves are damaged, the brain interprets the signals in many different ways, one of which is itching. The fact that you have survived lymphoma in the remote past indicates that you likely underwent some sort of chemotherapy treatment. Most of these are harmful to the nerves of your body, and the distal nerves can be the first to feel the side effects. Please speak to your doctor about your symptoms. "
What would cause my foot/feet to go to sleep while driving?,"I am sorry to hear about your problem. Most of us will experience some symptoms of our feet, legs, or arms falling asleep at different times. Usually, we can all explain this by pointing to something that we have done to cause compression of the nerve that is involving the area where the <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> and the tingling occur, such as lying on our arm in the wrong way for too long, sitting with our legs crossed, etc. In your case, it sounds like even just sitting is enough to cause the problem. While you do have a history of varicose veins, it is not likely that your treatment is enough to have caused this problem, although it is possible. More likely, there is some sort of compression on your nerve higher up. Although you don't mention this same problem when you are sitting at other times, I would be interested to know if you have this symptom at any other time. If so, I would <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> that you may be either affecting your nerves at some point between your spine and your foot or that you have some sort of problem with the nerve itself. Please speak more to your <a href=""/neurologists"">doctor</a> about your symptoms. "
Will getting an air purifier stop me from getting headaches?,"I think the answer to this question depends on what the overall cause of your headaches is. If you suffer from migraines or tension headaches, it is hard for me to imagine exactly what an air purifier will do for you, unless one of the triggers for your <a href=""/procedure/migraine-226"">migraine</a> is a strong smell that could be potentially eliminated from the air in your house by the filter. This is a great question for your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.

However, if the source of your headaches is chronic head pressure from nasal allergies or sinus congestion, then an air purifier could definitely play a role in relieving your symptoms. This is because nasal allergies and chronic sinus congestion are often related to breathing in indoor allergens like mold or mites or <a href=""/procedure/pet-ct-scan-250"">pet</a> dander. These substances can be partially removed from the air by an air filter unit, potentially helping to relieve your symptoms. 

If you do suffer from these allergies, it is unlikely that an air filter alone will completely remove your symptoms, however in combination with medications to fight the allergy, it could definitely play an important role. 

You should talk to your primary care doctor for an evaluation and diagnosis of your symptoms. Good luck!"
What causes shaky hands?,"Sorry to hear that this is such a persistent problem for you! I would suggest that you go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about the issue, if you have not done so already. 

There are several potential causes of shaky hands. One of these, probably the most common, is something called essential tremor. This is a condition which sometimes runs in families and, for the most part, is not a serious medical problem. The shakiness is often more pronounced when the affected person is tired or fatigued. 

There are, however, other medical problems that can cause shaky hands. One of this is an imbalance in the thyroid gland, something that you primary care doctor can check for easily with simple blood tests. Also, rarely, shaky hands may be a sign of a more serious neurological problem, such as Parkinson's disease. 

After your primary care doctor performs a thorough physical examination, they will be able to help you decide if this is something that you do not need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about, or whether it is something that requires further workup or, potentially, a referral to a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> for a more detailed examination. 

Go see your doctor as soon as you can!"
What is neurodermatitis and how is it treated?,"Neurodermatitis is also known as pathologic skin picking. It is characterized by constant picking at and damage to the skin, in the absence of any underlying skin disease that might trigger severe itching and the desire to pick at the skin. In other words, if your mother has been diagnosed formally with neurodermatitis, this means that other skin conditions would have been ruled out, and she would be picked at or scratching her skin because of a compulsion to do so, and not because of any underlying problem with itchy skin. 

This distinction is important, because the treatment of neurodermatitis is necessarily focused mostly at helping diminish this compulsion. This is done in a number of ways. For example, some medications that are also used to treat <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> and obsessive compulsive disorder can be effective in neurodermatitis. Additional, certain forms of psychological therapy or behavioral therapy can help suppress the compulsions. 

The bottom line is that your mother will need to work with her <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to develop an effective treatment plan. Based on her symptoms, this may include both medications and therapy sessions. She also may need the help of a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> to manage the damage to the skin that has resulted from the condition. "
What are some possible treatments for depression?,"It sounds like your brother is going through a very difficult time.  There are many options for treating depression, but to start, the most important thing for your brother to do is to make an appointment with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away.  It will be important for a physician to get a thorough history, including past history of any depressive episodes, and perform a general physical exam to make sure there aren't any other medical factors contributing to his depression and mood disorder.  Next, a primary care physician should be able to make a referral to a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> for a more detailed mental health evaluation.  Depression can present in many different ways, and depending upon your brother's age, symptoms, and family history, it may also be important to exclude other conditions.  Depression can be effectively treated with medications, therapy, or a combination of both.  It will be up to your brother to work with his doctors to decide which options may be best for him.  He may be a patient who would benefit from group counseling sessions or individual sessions or both.  In addition, choosing the best anti-depressant can be a complex decision that may require some adjustments based on how he tolerates a given medication.  Regular follow up and a treatment plan are important to help a patient recover his or her health. Start by encouraging your brother to book an appointment with his primary care <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> right away."
Can you help me start eating again?,"Anorexia is a very difficult condition to treat, and success requires the help of experts. I would suggest that you start by talking with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>, if you already have one. If not, talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, and begin looking for one. 

It would be best to work with a psychiatrist who has a lot of experience with eating disorders like anorexia. This is because a multidisciplinary team approach, complete with counseling, psychiatry, nutrition, and social work will be your best chance for success beating this condition. A psychiatry practice that specializes in eating disorders is most likely to be able to offer you all of these necessary services. 

If you don't have any idea where to start, another useful resource would be the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. This is a nonprofit organization that maintains a list of high quality treatment programs. You can visit their website at http://www.anad.org for more information and to look for services in your city or state. 

The bottom line is to get help as quickly as possible, because it is much harder to do this on your own than with a team of professionals supporting you. Book an appointment with your primary care doctor or psychiatrist today."
Do I have a personality disorder?,"Personality disorders are a set of complex personality conditions which lead to significant impairment in social functioning. Basically, they result when a given person has behaviors which significantly deviate from normal societal expectations. The various individual personality disorders all involve a set of behaviors which define them. For example, a ""histrionic"" personality disorder involves exaggerated emotional responses and inappropriate attention seeking behavior. 

If your regular <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> thinks that you might have a personality disorder, then it is definitely worth following up on this. The first step would be to see a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> or a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> for a formal evaluation. They will be able to help confirm or rule out the diagnosis. 

If the diagnosis of a personality disorder is confirmed, then they will also be able to recommend appropriate therapy. Unfortunately, medications are not effective for personality disorders, unless there is another psychiatric disorder (such as anxiety or depression) along with the personality disorder that can be treated with medications. However, various types of therapy, such as psychotherapy, have been effective in helping individuals suffering from these conditions to gain insight into the condition and to develop coping strategies which improve their abilities to interact socially.

What can someone do to get over the death of a parent?,"Many condolences on the loss of your father.  Losing a loved one is one of life's most difficult experiences and can be very difficult to get over.  It is perfectly normal to feel sad in the face of such an event, but you are right to notice that you may benefit from professional help if this overwhelming sadness persists for several years.  The best thing for you to do would be to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for an overall health evaluation and referral to a mental health provider.  Although it sounds like you may be suffering from depression brought on by the death of your dad, it is important to make sure that there are no other red flags for medical illness (since, for example, hypothyroid disease can sometimes also affect your mood in a way that might make a depression worse).  Your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> can help recommend a good <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>.  Overall, you may be a patient who will benefit from both therapy sessions as well as possible an anti-depressant medication.  Studies have shown that either therapy or medications can help with depression but the two together often work the best.  There may also be grief support sessions you can attend to help you learn coping strategies for managing and working through your grief with others who share the same challenges.  Hopefully you can move through this difficult time--you will always miss your Dad, but you don't want your grief to incapacitate you.Start by booking an appointment with you doctor today."
How do you get off the pill?,"Oral contraceptive pills (or OCPs) are an extremely effective method of <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">birth control</a> that are used by many women who are seeking to avoid becoming pregnant. As in your case, many women will stay on them for long periods of time, which lead to questions about how your body may react to a change in the hormones that it has been receiving for such a long time. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB GYN can help determine the best course of action for you.

While there is always the potential for some variation that can and should be discussed with your doctor before discontinuing any medication, most women are able to discontinue OCPs with minimal to no significant side effects. Some women who began taking OCPs for different reasons (such as <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a> or increased menstrual pain) may find that those old problems begin again when the pill is discontinued. In those cases especially, speaking with a doctor before discontinuing is prudent. Additionally, if you are stopping the pill because you are considering becoming pregnant, speaking with your doctor is wise to make sure you are taking care of your body in other ways so as to be able to have a healthy baby. If you do not wish to become pregnant, please consider alternative forms of birth control (and protection!)."
How can I get relief from sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucination?,"This is something I would recommend discussing with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep medicine specialist</a>. Sleep paralysis, as you probably have figured out from reading, is a condition in which the body's normal relaxed muscular state during deep REM sleep persists into awakening. This is not dangerous, but it can be quite frightening, because it essentially means that the person who suffers from it wakes up unable to move their body for a few minutes. This may also be associated with some hallucinations, again due to the persistence of ""sleep state"" into waking. 

Occasional episodes of this don't always need to be treated, because just knowing what is going on is often enough to put one's mind at rest. If the episodes are more frequent then it can be helpful to figure out why. There is a strong association between sleep deprivation and sleep paralysis, so working to improve your sleep schedule is often a place to start. 

If this doesn't work, then working with your primary care doctor or your sleep medicine doctor to consider other possibilities may be indicated. For example, sometimes anti-<a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> medications are tried, as these can be helpful, as they may either reduce the severity of the episodes or at least diminish the anxiety associated with them."
I started taking Lexapro and now I have knee swelling. Could this be related?,"Lexapro is one of several medications in the class selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They are commonly used to treat <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> and other mood problems. 

You are right to be thinking about side effects from the medication, as most medications do have side effects, even those which are used as commonly as Lexapro. Fortunately, I am not aware of knee or joint swelling as a side effect from Lexapro. Therefore, I think it is unlikely that your knee swelling is related to starting to take Lexapro. For this reason, I would recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They'll be able to take a look at your knee and help you figure out why it is swelling up. 

On the other hand, you should be on the lookout for any of the other side effects from Lexapro. The most common side effects include drowsiness or <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, nausea or weight changes, dry mouth, and effects on sexual drive. Most of these effects will get better, however, after a few weeks taking the medication. More serious (but rare) side effects from Lexapro can include stiff muscles, high fevers and sweating, severe nausea and vomiting, or severe headache. Call your doctor right away if you have any of those!"
Do I have ADD?,"<a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">ADD</a>, or attention deficit disorder (also related to Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, or ADHD), can be found in many age groups, although it is often thought of as being a disorder that affects only young children, and often thought of as just affecting boys. As with all psychiatric disorders, it is defined by a set of symptoms that, when present, indicate that the diagnosis of ADHD may be appropriate. Symptom checkers are available in many places online, but symptoms should include inattention and hyperactivity that are inappropriate for age and developmental level, and have been disruptive. Additionally, these must be present in more than just a single setting, and cannot be in the setting of another psychiatric issue. There must be some signs of the disorder before the age of 7 as well. The symptoms can then be subdivided into subtypes of ADHD based on the more prevalent features of the disorder, whether that be inattention or hyperactivity or a mixed type with features of both present for more than 6 months. If you are concerned about your mind wandering, there could be many possible answers. The best thing is to speak to your parents or guardian and your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> about your concerns."
Why can't I maintain my erection?,"You need to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, rather than trying to deal with this issue on your own. The fact that you can have an erection and orgasm with masturbation indicates that everything is ""working"" fine. This makes the possibility of a serious underlying medical problem as the cause of your sexual dysfunction, much less likely. 

Indeed, in the absence of known medical problems, the causes of sexual dysfunction in someone your age are almost always related to stress, fatigue, anxiety, or a mood problem, such as <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>. Nevertheless, starting with your primary care doctor is the best way to go. They will be able to perform a checkup to make absolutely certain that there is nothing medical going on. If not, then the next step would be to work with either your primary care doctor or your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to figure out if mood symptoms of depression are well controlled or if the problem is more related to lifestyle issues, such as stress. Depending on what this investigation reveals, they will be able to give you advice about how to proceed and what you can do to overcome this problem.

How to lessen Adderall-associated mood swings?,"I would recommend that you set up a visit with the <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> who is managing your medications for both ADHD and also for <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> to talk about this issue you are having with Adderall. Your psychiatrist will be able to evaluate you closely for a medication side effect and recommend any necessary changes to your medications. 

First of all, it may be that your ""mood swings"" are being caused more by the wear-off effect that happens later in the day when the Adderall is no longer present in significant concentrations in your body. This is one of the most common problems with ADHD medications, especially with instant release formulations. The effect can often be fixed either by switching to a different ADHD medication or by switching from an instant release to a long acting formulation of the medication. 

Second, it is also important to make sure that the overall dose of the medication is not too high, as this might produce irritability, <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, or other mood effects when the medication is peaking in your system. 

Finally, it is important to evaluate your depression symptoms to make sure those are under good control and not contributing to the overall picture here. 

Please discuss with your psychiatrist soon!"
"I keep feeling like I'm underweight though I know I'm not, why is that?","I would strongly suggest that you see a your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to talk about these issues. It sounds from your description as though you do not actually have a underweight problem at all. This means that there is a disconnect between your actual weight and what your mind perceives your weight to be. 

This could be a reaction to your legal blindness, causing some insecurity with your surroundings and environment which is manifesting as feeling ""frail"" or physically brittle, even though you are not. 

Alternatively, this could be from a more serious psychiatric problem, such as an anxiety disorder or a body dysmorphic disorder. 

Your psychiatrist will be able to talk through these issues and help you decided what needs to be done. Sometimes medications may be helpful, for example in the case of a serious anxiety disorder. On the other hand, you may just need to spend some time with a counselor or <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> working through some of these issues. Your psychiatrist will be able to help you determine whether or not you need medication and, furthermore, should be able to recommend a therapist or counselor for you if you do not already have one. 

Please contact your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> as soon as you can!"
Why do I keep randomly forgetting things?,"It sounds like you may need to discuss the results of neuropsychiatry testing and memory testing with the physicians who ordered them.  It will be helpful for you to know the exact results of those tests, so that you can put that in perspective with the results of your other testing. Overall it sounds like you have had a very thorough workup for your deficit in short-term memory.  It is encouraging to know that your MRI and <a href=""/procedure/eeg-237"">EEG</a> were normal.  You are correct that sleep apnea can cause memory difficulties for some people, but if you have been told that your sleep study excluded sleep apnea, then that is also an important negative test.

It might also be helpful for you to go back to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to get a big picture view of the results of your various specialist visit.  In addition, it might also be helpful for you to discuss with a physician who knows you well the possibility of seeing a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> as part of your work-up.  Memory difficulties can be caused by many different things, and your statement that you see your memory loss as a ""defense mechanism"" against worrying suggests that it might be worth discussing your memory issues with a mental health specialist. Good luck."
What should I do about being depressed?,"<a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">Depression</a> can be a very serious medical condition that affects every part of your life.  It sounds like there are many stressors in your life that are contributing to your feeling of being depressed, and working with health care providers to improve your physical and mental health will be very important in helping you feel better.  The first thing it is important to know is that if you are having a health crisis--if you feel unsafe or a danger to yourself or others--you should go to the nearest emergency room right away.  Secondly, even without insurance there should be health care clinics in your community that help provide medical care for people without insurance.  A nearby hospital can be a first step for helping you identify these facilities.  It will be important for you to see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can go over your health history (including your mental health history) to suggest ways for you to manage your depression as well as your other symptoms like headaches and <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>.  For depression specifically, many patients benefit from either therapy or medications or both.  A primary care physician can help connect you with resources for financial assistance with medications.  Some pharmacies have a list of generic medications with very low co-pays, and some pharmaceutical companies also offer financial assistance for patients.  The most important thing for you to know is that there are options to treat your depression, and the way to move forward is to be connected with a health care clinic that accepts patients without insurance. Furthermore, any emergency room can see you immediately if you feel that you are a danger to yourself or someone else. Good luck."
Do I need help for my weight?,"I am very concerned about what I am reading in your question. 1000 calories is very, very few calories. The fact that you are exercising vigorously and eating very little, also inducing yourself to vomit up food, and feeling very preoccupied with being skinnier than you are all suggest to me that you are most likely struggling with disordered eating. 

Eating disorders are very serious medical problems, and they can result in life threatening problems such as severe malnutrition and heart damage. I strongly recommend that you seek immediate medical and psychiatric help for figuring out what is going on and deciding what you need to do next. 

If you have a good relationship with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> you should contact them immediately and let them know what is going on, and they will help hook you up with the service you need. Similarly, if you have a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> already, they should be able to help you right away. If you feel like your eating patterns and purging are really out of control, or if you have any serious symptoms like <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> when you stand up, then you should go immediately to an emergency room and they will help you get more immediate services. 

Good luck, and I wish you all the best."
"Why do I have chest pain, tingling arms, and my left eye twitches daily?","The symptoms you are having, particularly the chest pains, do occasionally go along with a heart problem. However, it seems like you have had that worked up pretty well, so the likelihood is lower that this is related to your heart. 

Panic attacks and <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> disorder can also definitely cause these types of symptoms. If, despite being on medications, you are still having symptoms, then it is probably time to talk with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> again to see if any changes to your medications should be attempted. 

Also, it is important to point out that smoking cigarettes is almost certainly making your symptoms worse. I would strongly suggest that you talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about quitting smoking, because reducing or eliminating your nicotine intake could help the twitching symptoms and also relieve some of your anxiety-related complaints. These days, there are many effective approaches to quitting smoking, which include counselling, nicotine replacement, and other medications. Some of these medications are also used to treat anxiety, so you might be able to settle on a new medication that could help you both quit smoking and also treat your anxiety. 

Talk to both your primary care doctor and your psychiatrist as soon as you can. "
What will paranoid schizophrenia do if untreated?,"Paranoid <a href=""/procedure/schizophrenia-psychotic-features-181"">schizophrenia</a> is a very unfortunate mental disease that affects less than 1% of the population.  The characteristics of the condition include hallucinations, and inappropriate paranoid delusions.  People that suffer from paranoid schizophrenia tend to not function well in society.  They may have trouble holding on to a job, and may have trouble supporting themselves.  This is why they unfortunately often become homeless or become institutionalized.

Modern treatments for schizophrenia include many medications that can help reduce the hallucinations and paranoia.  Examples include clozapine, Seroquel, and olanzepine.  These medications work for many people (at least partially), but must be taken regularly to have effect.  The medications do not ever make the schizophrenia go away.  Thus while they control symptoms, if someone where to stop the medications, the symptoms would return.  If untreated, people with schizophrenia often go into social isolation and have trouble functioning in society.  

If you think that someone you know is suffering from schizophrenia, you should schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>.  This is the type of <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> that is most adept at both the diagnosis and treatment of someone with this disease.  Regular appointments as well as contact with a support group are important for the overall care of the patient.  I hope that helps.  "
Why does my vagina hurt when I have sex?,"I strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your OB GYN doctor about this issue right away. The first thing that they will want to do is make sure that there is not a medical problem underlying this pain with intercourse. There are several different medical problems that could be associated with pain with intercourse, including <a href=""/procedure/endometriosis-1455"">endometriosis</a>, fibroids of the uterus, cysts in the ovaries, or infections of the cervix, vagina, or pelvic organs. Ruling out these conditions will require a physical examination, and it may also require additional testing, such as blood work or an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of the pelvis. 

If your doctor rules out all serious medical causes of this pain, then there are still a few possibilities to be thought about. One of these is vaginal dryness, or insufficient vaginal lubrication, which is probably the most common cause of pain with sexual intercourse. This condition can generally be remedied with lengthy foreplay or with use of a personal lubricant. Additionally, there is a condition called vaginismus, in which the vagina involuntarily contracts with sex, usually associated with prior bad sexual experiences or with  a traumatic personal experience. 

Make an appointment with your doctor right away!"
Can you recommend a doctor that is using Ketamine for severe depression?,"I am very sorry to hear about your severe and persistent <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> symptoms, and I am also very concerned, as you are, about the persistent suicidal ideation, which is extremely dangerous. 

In the short term, the most important thing is to set up a safety contract with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> or with another health care provider that you trust to help prevent another suicide attempt. Also, if you are feeling acutely suicidal, it is extremely important to seek immediate emergency medical help, such as by going to the emergency room of your local hospital. 

In the medium to long term, it sounds really critical that you get help from a psychiatric specialist who is skilled in dealing with the more complex cases of depression. You will need to talk with your current psychiatrist or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to get help with this referral process, because who you need to go see will depend in part on what part of the country you are in and what the psychiatric referral system looks like there. 

Ketamine, unfortunately, is used only investigationally in the treatment of depression and is not approved for this indication. There are a few small trials looking at this but, once again, you would need help from your current psychiatrist to determine whether enrolling in one of these trials is an option in your area of the country. "
What is the efficacy rate of ECT for chronic depression that does not respond to meds?,"I would recommend you discuss this with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. The question you ask is an excellent one, however also very complex. The answer really depends on what your diagnosis, history and personal preference. Again, speak to your psychiatrist for more information.

Firstly, <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>, as you must be aware, is a very severe disease. There are significant issues that can result from this, some of which are drastically affect the quality of your life. In addition, this disease can be fatal. If you at any point feel or have thoughts of hurting yourself, killing yourself or committing suicide, I would strongly encourage you to go to your local emergency room.

As for question, the efficacy of rate of ECT varies with the patient, disease and way it is done. It is important to note that there are significant side effects, so one must really way the risks against the possible benefits. ECT can help people with depression -- around 50% will have some benefit to their depression. However, ECT rarely has lasting effects beyond 6 months. That is to say, most people have recurrence of their depression even if they have some benefit. It really depends on your disease and preference if you want to take the risks for the potential benefit.

Please talk to your psychiatrist soon. Good luck."
Is cabin fever a real condition?,"There is definitely an association between the winter months and symptoms such as <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> and depression. 

Historically, 'cabin <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>' has referred to the symptoms of claustrophobia, stress, and anxiety that develop when someone has to stay inside for long periods of time without access to the outdoors. Although this is not a technical psychiatric diagnosis, it is a well recognized phenomenon. Usually most sufferers of cabin fever experience relief if they can start spending more times outdoors, such as engaging in winter sports activities. 

Another, more serious condition is something called seasonal affective disorder. This is a condition in which a person experiences symptoms of mood disruption, including depressive symptoms and, sometimes, anxiety as well, due to decreased exposure to sunlight during the dark winter months. This condition can result in pretty significant disturbance in social functioning, and it often does require treatment either with prescribed light therapy or with certain classes of anti depressant medications. 

If you are concerned about your mental health, then the best first step would be to make an appointment with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> for a comprehensive evaluation. They will help you decide whether or not you need specific treatment!"
What's the best way to deal with an anxiety attack if I feel one coming on?,"I am very sorry to hear that you recently had an anxiety attack. Panic attacks and anxiety disorder are very serious medical problems which can cause major disruption in your ability to function socially and on the job. Therefore, if you have not talked to a doctor about this issue, you really should do that as soon as possible. You can talk to either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or, if you have one, to a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. 

Treatment for anxiety disorders involves both counseling and medications in most cases. Working with a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or counselor can be quite helpful, because they can help you identify triggers that bring on your anxiety and also mental techniques that you can employ to help reduce stress and anxiety symptoms. 

In addition, most patients with these conditions benefit from medications. On the on hand, there are medications that are taken every day which are useful for reducing over all anxiety symptoms. In addition, there are more rapid acting medications that are sometimes used in particular to help terminate severe symptoms or panic attacks. 

The first step is to get a formal evaluation and treatment plan from your doctor, so make an appointment as soon as you can. "
Is it possible that I have ADD?,"Attention deficit disorder is a common condition which is characterized by trouble concentrating and completing tasks. There is often a great deal of distractibility and there may also be problems with impulsivity. 

Lately, attention deficit disorder is being diagnosed more and more in adults, whereas before it was primarily diagnosed only in children. However, critically, in most cases of adult attention deficit disorder, there is a strong history of preexisting symptoms (although perhaps previously undiagnosed) in childhood or adolescence. Therefore, if you have no recollection of any history previously of any symptoms reminiscent of ADD, then this does decrease the probability that this is what you are dealing with. 

Nevertheless, there are numerous things that could be causes your trouble with racing thoughts. Commonly, fatigue and stress can cause this problem. However, it could also be from a different psychiatric problem, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. 

I suggest that you start by making an appointment with a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> to discuss your symptoms, especially if they are persistent. You could meet with either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. They should be able to perform a full assessment and help you decide what needs to be done next. "
How can I control my heart rate during a panic attack?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are suffering from recurrent panic attacks. As you have experienced, these attacks can be quite overwhelming, with a lot of physical symptoms including racing heart rate and palpitations. 

Some people with panic attacks can learn breathing and other biofeedback strategies that they can use when they feel a panic attack coming on, to either prevent the attack or make it less severe. These are technique that a counselor or <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> could begin to introduce you to, and you should make an appointment with one of these if you are interested in pursuing the matter further. 

It would also be a good idea to talk with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> some about your persistent symptoms. I say this because many people with panic attacks do well with a daily medication to reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks. Additionally, it is sometimes helpful to have a fast acting medication on hand that you can take in the middle of an attack to relieve the symptoms. Your doctor can discuss these various medication options with you and help you decide if this would be a good approach in your case. 

Good luck!"
Does it seem like I'm having a dystonic reaction?,"These sound like potentially serious side effects that need immediate attention. I recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or the doctor who is prescribing your psychiatric medications, right away. If you cannot get in right away, you should go back to the emergency room for another evaluation. 

Dystonic reactions to medications like Seroquel are relatively common severe side effects, and they can occur at any time while taking the medication. If you are still taking the medication, the first thing to do would be to discontinue it immediately while waiting for medical evaluation. Although you are right that dystonic reaction is usually quite uncomfortable and painful, sometimes it can be atypical. Nevertheless, if this is what you have it needs immediate treatment and also a change in your medications, with avoidance of Seroquel in the future. 

Another possibility that needs to be ruled out is something called tardive dyskinesia, which is a rare side effect of medications like Seroquel that can cause uncontrollable (non painful) motions of the muscles. It is important to diagnose this condition right away because it is sometimes not reversible, especially if you continue to take the medication. 

Go see your doctor right away!"
Can my general practitioner treat my anxiety?,"It is great to year that you have such a strong relationship with your general practitioner. The good news is that most general practitioners do feel competent and comfortable treating most cases of <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> and <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>, as well as other basic psychiatric conditions. 

What I would suggest is that you set up an appointment with your general practitioner to discuss what exactly the symptoms are that you are experiencing. She can perform the initial evaluation and assessment and, in most cases, make the diagnosis of anxiety or a related condition and begin treatment. 

Treatment for these conditions typically includes a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). She may also recommend some individual or group counseling or therapy sessions, which can provide additional benefit. 

If, on the other hand, your general practitioner feels that your symptoms are too complex for her to manage, or if she suspects that you may be dealing with more than one psychiatric issue at the same time, then she may choose to enlist the help of a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> in figuring out what medications to use. Nevertheless, I am certain that she will stay involved in your treatment and care even if this is the case. "
How do you know if you have a panic attack?,"Panic attacks are usually quite recognizable. They involve specific episodes in which a person becomes overcome by an intense sensation of anxiety or fear. There are usually many physical symptoms, which can include blurry vision, nausea, palpitations of the heart, dizziness, and sweating. 

In addition to panic attacks, an anxiety disorder can cause more generalized feelings of anxiety and 'racing thoughts', although these symptoms may overlap with other psychiatric problems, such as bipolar disorder, as well as with just general life events, such as fatigue or stress. 

If these symptoms have been persistent for a while for you and are not getting any better, then it would be a good idea for you to see a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> about them. I would recommend that you start either with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or with a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. They can specifically screen you for anxiety and panic disorders, as well as other psychiatric problems. 

If they diagnose you with one of these conditions, the good news is that there are often very effective treatments, which can include both therapy and counseling as well as several different medications. 

Start by making an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible, and I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Can panic attacks cause nausea?,"Panic attacks, as you know, are very disturbing episodes of overwhelming <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, often accompanied by a whole range  of physical symptoms, which can include nausea, blurry vision, sweating, dizziness, and racing heart beat. Nausea is one of the most common symptoms associated with panic attacks, and most people who have them will endorse a feeling of nausea. 

If you are having regular panic attacks with significant symptoms, this is definitely something that you should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> about. There are very effective medications that can be used both to prevent panic attacks and also to control the symptoms when the do occur and, if you have not talked to a doctor about these medications yet, you should do so as soon as possible. 

At the same time, there are many other potential medical causes for nausea, and these also need to be investigated in your case, especially since you say that sometimes you have nausea without having other symptoms of a panic attack. Your primary care doctor will be able to perform a complete medical checkup and help you figure out if there is something going on that needs further testing or treatment. 

Get in to see your doctor as soon as you can. "
Do drugs that treat depression also help with anxiety?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having such trouble with anxiety attacks. You absolutely must see a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> about this as soon as possible to get some relief! You could start by seeing either your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. 

It turns out that there are very effective medications that can be used to treat problems with panic and anxiety. In fact, some of these medications are the same medications that are used to treat depression! As such, they are medications that are taken by millions of people around the world and are effective with minimal side effects. 

Start by seeing your doctor and explaining your symptoms to them. If they diagnose you with an anxiety problem, they will be able to recommend a few treatment options. One of those, as we have already discussed, is likely to be medications. However, you may also benefit from counseling or therapy sessions to help you deal with and control the symptoms of anxiety. 

After deciding on what treatments to start with initially, your doctor will want to follow you very closely over the next several months, both looking to make sure that the medications are working and also to make sure that you are not having too many side effects. 

Good luck. "
Are there any treatment for panic attacks?,"I am sorry that you have been experiencing panic attacks.  You should follow up with a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to discuss your symptoms to determine if you have a panic disorder or another kind of <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> disorder and to discuss possible treatment options for your specific case.

In a panic disorder, sudden panic attacks are usually unprovoked, as opposed to other anxiety disorders where the attack is often brought on by a specific occurrence.  A panic attack is an episode of significant fear that starts suddenly and ends quickly.  Palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, dizziness, and chest pain can also be part of a panic attack.  

After speaking with a psychiatrist, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be recommended as it is currently the treatment of choice for panic disorders.  Medications may also be considered.  For example, a benzodiazepine (like Ativan) may be recommended to take on an as needed basis for periods of increased anxiety. A longer term SSRI (anti-depressant medication like Prozac) can also be of use in addition to CBT and close psychiatric follow up.

You should follow up with your primary care provider and find a psychiatrist to discuss your symptoms of panic attacks.  You primary <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> can ensure that there are no other underlying etiologies for your symptoms, and the psychiatrist can help with short and long term management of panic attacks and anxiety."
Am I dizzy because I stopped taking Effexor?,"Venlafaxine (brand name: Effexor) is an anti-deppresant medication commonly used to treat anxiety and depression. It is in a SNRI class of medications. SNRI stands for Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor. This in essence describes the mechanism by which it works. It delays reuptake of Serotonin and norephinephrin in nerve junctions, thereby letting them work longer. 

It has been reported that when Effexor -- and other SSRI/SNRI class of medications -- is/are stopped abruptly, patients can develops something called the ""discontinuation syndrome"" The symptoms vary widely, but things like dizziness, nausea, headache, tremmor, and fatigue have all been commonly reported. 

It sounds like you've stopped you're medication rather abruptly. If this is the case, then the chance of you experiencing your symptoms is higher. It is usually recommended that if you no longer need the medication, that you should taper it down instead of stopping it suddenly. 

Speak to your prescribing physician, which can be your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to discuss whether your symptoms are truly due to the discontinuation of Effexor. It is certainly possible, but other causes should be ruled out. If your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> thinks that your symptoms are truly related to stopping the Effexor, then you should develop a taper regimen which would help reduce and/or eliminate these symptoms."
Could Effexor be causing my weight gain?,"Effexor is an excellent medication for treating <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>, and it is safely used by many people around the world. That being said, there are some side effects associated with taking the medication. One of the most common side effects is some weight gain, so I think that it is not unlikely that the weight gain you have noticed is from the Effexor. 

Importantly, Effexor doesn't produce weight gain primarily by causing the body to handle foods differently. Rather, it works by stimulating the appetite centers in the brain, causing you to tend to eat more than you normally would. This is a helpful insight, because it means that, if you are aware of this tendency to have more appetite on the medication, you can probably in part control the weight gain by paying close attention to what you are eating. 

You should also talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>, whichever is prescribing the medication for you. They will be able to confirm whether or not, in your case, the Effexor is the most likely cause of your weight gain. If the weight gain is unacceptable to you, you could explore options with your doctor like changing the medication or the dose of the medication. "
What are the side effects of lithium?,"Sorry to hear that you have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, it is good news that you have found a good <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> who is going to help you get started on medications. 

There are many useful medications that can be used for treating bipolar disorder. Lithium is one of the oldest medications around for treating bipolar disorder, and its side effects are consequently well known and fairly predictable. The most common side effects from taking lithium include tremors, blurry vision, dry mouth, thirst, and <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a>. It is also common to have some nausea or some changes in appetite. Most of the time, these side effects are worst when you are just starting the medication and improve as you keep taking the medication. 

There are also some more serious side effects from taking lithium, most of which are associated with taking too much of the medication. For this reason, your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> will want to monitor blood levels of your lithium at regular intervals, and you should make sure to follow up with those lab draws and office appointments, as well as remembering always to take the medication exactly as prescribed. 

Good luck, and I hope you are feeling better soon! Please work with your psychiatrist to resolve your questions in more detail. "
Does my son have to take Adderall?,"ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is a common psychiatric <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> diagnosed in children under the age of 7.  The ailment is unique in that the individual possesses attention deficit and hyperactivity as behavioral problems. Diagnosis is often made after symptoms of hyperactivity and inattentiveness is diagnosed. Treatment has been controversial since as early as the 1970's.  It is important to take your child to a primary care provider or to an individual who specializes in pediatric or adolescent psychiatry to make a proper diagnosis.  This way if the person has a diagnosis of ADHD that could be made according to medical guidelines.  Classically the medicines of choice used to treat ADHD include the use of stimulants. Although it is anecdotal alternative therapies do exist out there for ADHD. These therapies may include the modification of diet; addition and removal of particular compounds in the diet, other alternative therapies include psychological feedback. The use of herbal supplements have also been evaluated but the use of these are not currently approved for children.  Although there are therapies for ADHD including the use of stimulants as well as diet modifications and feedback, it is important to consult your primary care physcician prior to initiating these therapies."
Do I have OCD?,"OCD, or obsessive compulsive disorder, is a condition in which intrusive thoughts or compulsions are experienced. Usually, there are also repetitive or odd behaviors, such as frequent hand washing, or checking multiple times to make sure the door is locked. OCD typically will cause pretty significant social dysfunction, creating problems at school, in your job, and in your relationships. 

If you think you might have OCD, you will need to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> for further evaluation and formal diagnosis. Fortunately, if you are diagnosed with OCD, there are multiple therapies which have shown to be effective, including counseling sessions to help develop strategies to overcome the compulsions and behaviors, as well as several classes of medications. 

There are also a few other conditions that your doctor will be able to consider. For example, if you are concerned about your appearance, this might be a social <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> problem or a simple phobia, for example a fear that people are going to laugh at you. Furthermore, something called body dysmorphic disorder is a condition in which people feel like there is something wrong with the appearance of their body. 

Start by setting up a visit with your doctor to discuss your symptoms today! "
If I'm having trouble focusing does that mean that I have attention deficit disorder?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are suddenly having trouble concentrating in school. I would definitely suggest that you talk to someone about this problem as soon as possible, before it starts to affect your school performance. Medical professionals that would be well trained to help you would include your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a>, or a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. 

It is certainly possible that you are suffering from attention deficit disorder (ADD). This condition is being diagnosed more and more in adults, although in retrospect most of them had symptoms already as children or teenagers and were simply not diagnosed in time. Symptoms of ADD can include trouble concentrating, trouble finishing tasks, racing thoughts, and labile moods or trouble with impulse control. 

However, these symptoms can also be associated with several other potential disorders including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Additionally, many times trouble concentrating and focusing is simply related to being really stressed out and not getting enough time to relax and get good sleep. 

Regardless, I would start by calling and making an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. They will be able to review your symptoms and help you figure out what is going on!"
Would changing my child's diet help with her Autism?,"I am very sorry to hear that your child has recently been diagnosed with autism, which I am sure is a source of stress for you and your family. As you know, autism is a chronic <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> in childhood, and managing it will require that you get help from your child's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>, and perhaps other specialists as well. 

Although many complementary and alternative therapies have been tried for autism, none of these have been shown to result in a significant change in behavior. For example, gluten-free and casein-free diets are very popular in some parenting circles for treating autism symptoms, but scientific studies of these diets have not shown them to be very effective. Additionally they may result in nutritional deficiencies if they are followed strictly for long periods of time. 

Effective therapy for autism is mostly focused on behavioral interventions and training from a team of specialists. Outcomes are best when the therapy is multidisciplinary and started early in life. Regular visits with your daughter's pediatrician and psychiatrist are especially important, to make sure that any particularly troubling symptoms or behaviors are identified and can potentially be targeted with medication therapies as needed. "
What should I do to prevent a panic attack?,"Panic attacks are a serious medical problem, because they can lead to very serious problems with social coping and they can also lead to impairment in job and school performance and in relationships. For this reason, you should definitely talk to your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctor</a> about this issue. I suggest that you either see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> for help. 

In general, people who suffer from panic attacks or an anxiety disorder will benefit from regular counseling or therapy. These therapy sessions can help you identify panic triggers and can help you learn strategies for preventing and for dealing with stress and anxiety attacks. 

However, at the same time, most people who have an anxiety disorder should also be taking a medication for their symptoms. There are two main types of medication that are used for anxiety disorders. The first are medications that are taken daily to help reduce general anxiety and improve overall functioning. The second are medications that are taken in the middle of an acute worsening of symptoms to help alleviate the symptoms. 

Your primary care doctor or your psychiatrist will be able to talk to you about all of these options and help you come up with a good plan. "
Is it possible that I have OCD?,"OCD, or obsessive compulsive disorder, is a quite common psychiatric disorder which is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including intrusive thoughts and compulsions as well as, often, repetitive actions or habits (think about constantly washing your hands, for example, as the most classic example). An important feature of OCD is that it tends to cause a lot of impairment in various domains, such as relationships, school, or work. 

If you are having recurrent intrusive thoughts, or if you are subject to the need to perform repetitive actions or habits, then you may have OCD. This is something that you would need to talk about at length with either a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. They will be able to assess the full range of your symptoms and help figure out what is going on. 

It is also possible that you are simply suffering from stress or <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, manifesting as constant worrying that you are sick or that there is something wrong with your body. These are also issues that you should talk to either a psychiatrist or your primary care doctor, as they will be able to assess whether you need to begin any form of treatment, whether therapy, counseling, or medications. 

Good luck!"
I think I have Cachexia from amphetamines. What test will tell me?,"The situation that you are describing is a very very serious one. In fact, it sounds like a life threatening situation. It sounds like you are dependent on potentially very dangerous medications, and that you are getting them on the street.

The extreme <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> and fatigue, together with the lack of appetite, all sound like potentially symptoms of adderall overuse, although it could be a combination of the medications that you are dependent on that are giving you the symptoms. It is also possible that your symptoms are also caused by another serious medical problem, such as an infection. 

Regardless, you are in a situation where your extreme weight loss and weakness and loss of muscle have become life threatening. I strong suggest that you call 911 right away and get an ambulance to bring you to the emergency room. Without doing this right away, your life is in extreme danger. 

In the emergency room, the <a href=""/psychiatrists"">doctors</a> will be able first to work on your acute medical issues. After this, they will be able to help you get psychiatric and substance abuse counselling to work with you on getting you off of these dangerous medications in a safe way. "
Is emphysema permanent?,"This is an excellent question, and one your father should ask his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about.  Unfortunately, <a href=""/procedure/emphysema-213"">emphysema</a> is not a condition that goes away even if a person does quit smoking...but, quitting smoking can help prevent any further lung damage from developing and is a critical step for managing the symptoms and quality of life for patients with emphysema.

Briefly, emphysema refers to a process in the lungs in which the connective tissue supporting the alveoli (or air sacs) in the lungs is damaged.  This leads to difficulty with moving air in and out of the lungs and with the transfer of carbon dioxide from the blood into the lungs to be exhaled in exchange for inhaled oxygen traveling from the lungs into the blood.  Some causes of emphysema are genetic, but the most common cause is exposure to inhaled toxins from air pollution or cigarette smoke.

Once connective tissue is destroyed the damage is permanent, but in patients who are continually exposed to smoke or pollution, damage can continue.  As you have probably already observed with your father, the main symptoms of emphysema include shortness of breath and difficulty with exertion.  In order to improve quality of life for patients with emphysema, minimizing any further damage to the lungs is very important.  If your father is willing to quit smoking, this will help his long-term health.  Overall, patients with emphysema are often managed by a pulmonary specialist who can help provide further recommendations about smoking cessation and medications for symptom control. I would begin by booking an appointment with a primary care doctor, who may refer your father to a pulmonary specialist."
I have a recurrent chest infection - what should I do?,"It sounds like you have been quite ill lately!  Any kind of infection with staph aureus can be very serious.  If you are feeling unwell and noticing a return of your initial presenting symptoms, it is very important that you notify your treating physician right away.  He or she will need to re-evaluate your treatment course and physical exam to determine the next course of action.  

Overall, there are several reason why you could have developed this recurrent infection.  First, it is possible that even though your original infection may have been with Staph aureus, you may now have developed a superinfection with another organism.  When the lung tissue is effected by infection, it can be easier for secondary organisms to cause subsequent infection.  In order to determine whether this is the case, your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> may want to consider repeating a <a href=""/procedure/bronchoscopy-217"">bronchoscopy</a> to evaluate what type (or types) of bacteria, if any, are growing.  Depending upon your underlying health conditions, it is also possible that you may be susceptible to fungal infections in the lung.  Further evaluation, possible with bronchoscopy, or also with additional imaging such as CT will likely help your physician determine if there is evidence of another infection.  If you have not been evaluated by a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">lung specialist</a>, this may also be helpful. Good luck, and please discuss with a doctor soon."
Did getting pneumonia make my asthma worse?,"As a lifelong asthmatic you know that there are many different triggers that can affect your asthma.  Pulmonary infections are certainly something that can trigger an asthma flare or cause recurrent asthma symptoms even after the underlying infection is treated.  In this case, the best thing for you to do is see your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>.  If your asthma has been managed by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, he or she might want you to see a pulmonary specialist given that your previously stable asthma is now a lot worse.  It will be important to get repeat pulmonary function tests to compare to your prior studies to see how much worse your lung function actually is at this point.  Your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> will also want to examine your carefully to look for any other signs of infection or allergy triggers.  You may still have some underlying lung changes from your earlier infection that can be noted when listening to your lungs.

Overall, it is likely that your doctor will want to adjust your medications to help get you through this period of recovering from a pneumonia. It is not unusual for asthmatics to need additional steroids in the setting of a bacterial infection.  The bottom line is that you should definitely see your doctor as soon as possible so you can begin moving forward with adjusting your asthma treatment to get back to your normal baseline."
Can you catch pleurisy?,"As you know from your friend's experience, pleurisy can be very painful.  In general, pleurisy refers to an inflammation and irritation of the lining (the pleura) surrounding the lung.  Most often this inflammation is caused by an infection of some kind, including respiratory viral infections or bacterial infections including pneumonia.  If your friend's symptoms were due to an infection, especially a respiratory virus, you could certainly have caught the same infection from her.  However, pleuritic chest pain is also associated with many other different conditions that are not contagious.  A pneumothorax (partially collapsed lung) can cause pleurisy, as can underlying lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, blood clots in the lungs, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diseases including lupus or rheumatoid <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, or chest surgeries or procedures.

If you are experiencing chest pain, the best thing to do is to seek immediate medical attention to make sure that you don't have a serious illness.  In particular, if your chest pain is associated with fevers, shortness of breath, <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> or lightheadedness, you should be seen by a physician right away, even if that means going to the emergency department. A emergency/urgent care physician or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will want to take a detailed history of your chest pain and other associated symptoms and examine you to make sure that any underlying health issues are treated properly."
Could the air at my workplace have caused my bronchitis?,"<a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">Bronchitis</a> is a very common lung condition in which the large tubes that conduct air in the upper parts of the lungs become infected and inflamed, either due to a virus or a bacteria. Symptoms include tightness in the chest and cough. Most of the time, bronchitis will clear up with antibiotics, if you are advised to take them by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. 

Since bronchitis is caused by an infection in the lungs, it is unlikely that the air at your workplace would have directly caused the infection. However, we do know that breathing contaminants from the air into the lungs is a risk factor for a number of lung conditions, including asthma and frequent lung infections. In part this is because the particles in the contaminated air stimulate swelling in the lungs and also inhibit some of the lungs natural defense mechanisms. So it is possible that there is an association between your exposure to dirty air and your current case of bronchitis. 

I would suggest that you get in to see your primary care doctor about this issue. They will be able to examine you for other signs of <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> related to dusty exposure, such as nasal allergies or asthma and help you develop a plan for keeping healthy. "
How long does bronchitis last?,"I am sorry to hear that you are dealing with <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a> which, as your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> probably told you, is an infection of the large tubes that conduct air inside the lungs. The condition is relatively common, and it causes significant symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. Fortunately, the condition also usually responds quickly to antibiotics, so you should be feeling better soon. 

In terms of how long you will be contagious for, most of the time after 24 hours of taking the antibiotics you should be safe to go back to work or school, as long as you are feeling up to it. However, you should check with your doctor first, as sometimes they may want you to stay home longer for other reasons. 

Also, make sure to take the entire prescription of antibiotic that you were given. Stopping the prescription early, even if you are feeling better, could allows the symptoms to come back again. 

Finally, although most of the time the bronchitis will clear up quickly with treatment, if you find that you are still feeling short of breath or still having significant cough even after several days on the antibiotic, you should go back to your doctor to make sure that things are improving as expected. "
How long should bronchitis last?,"I highly suggest that your father get in to see his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if things are not getting better. 

Bronchitis, as you probably known, is an infection of the upper tubes in the lungs. It can lead to wheezing and to cough that can linger on for quite a while. However, if he has been taking his medications and treatments as prescribed, and if he is not getting better, it is time to consider alternative possibilities and to reevaluate his treatment. 

For example, sometimes the infection that starts as bronchitis can worsen despite treatment and turn into <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a>, which is a more serious lung infection that often requires stronger antibiotics and, sometimes, hospitalization. 

Also problems with asthma, which causes serious trouble with breathing and produces a lot of wheezing, may sometimes be confused with bronchitis. Asthma can lead to very serious breathing difficulties if not treated. 

Finally, if your father is middle aged or elderly and has a history of smoking, then chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<a href=""/procedure/copd-389"">COPD</a>) is another potential diagnosis that will need to be considered. 

Again, the best first step would be for him to set up a visit very soon with his primary care doctor for a repeat evaluation. "
Does a crackling sound indicate Pulmonary Fibrosis?,"Crackles is a term that is used to describe a sound that is heard when a doctor listens to the lungs with a stethoscope. Generally, these are extremely quiet sounds that can't be heard without using a stethoscope, so I am not sure what to make of the sounds that you are hearing when you go to sleep at night. Wheezing on the other had is a sound that can be audibly heard with inhalation, and I wonder if this might be what you are hearing, especially since there is a strong association between bad acid reflux (GERD) and night time wheezing. This might also be the cause of your 'adult onset asthma.'

Pulmonary fibrosis does cause crackles (heard with a stethoscope) and there are a few studies that suggest that it might be associated with chronic severe GERD. Again, however, I am not sure that this is what you are hearing when you are falling asleep. 

In summary, I think it is excellent that you are going to see a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>, because they should be able to shed a lot of light on the situation. It also sounds like you need to get your GERD under better control, and you could talk to either a <a href=""/gastroenterologists"">gastroenterologist</a> or your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. "
Is it possible that I have pleurisy?,"Yes, it is possible that you may have pleurisy. <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">Pneumonia</a> is inflammation of the lung generally secondary to an infection, or sometimes related to aspiration or other causes. Symptoms of pneumonia even after clinical recovery maybe mild, or very severe. Generally the treatment of pneumonia is to treat the exact cause and treat with targeted antibiotics. 
From what you are describing, you should definitely see your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> or medical <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> to ensure that your symptoms are not related to a recurrent penumonia. Pleurisy, which is an inflammation of the lining of the lung, or pleura and is painful due to the nerve fibers that supply the pleura. Pleurisy is often accompanied with an effusion or fluid and sometimes this may even get infected secondarily. In addition, sick individuals may have chest pain that is related to other causes from the heart. Therefore, if you are having symptoms of persistent cough and chest pain with breathing you should definitely make an appointment to see your physician as soon as possible to prevent further deterioration in your lung function. Your doctor will be able to take a detailed history of your symptoms, do a thorough examination of your heart and lungs and if needed obtain laboratory and imaging studies to reach a diagnosis and treat you appropriately. "
What is video-assisted thoracoscopy?,"There are two potential procedures here. Medical <a href=""/procedure/thoracoscopy-219"">thoracoscopy</a> vs Video-assisted Thoracic <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> or VATS.

Medical thoracoscopy involved placement of an endoscope through the skin, fat, muscle and bone into the pleural space (inside the chest) to visualize the lung and pleural space directly (as opposed to CT scans for example). This can be a diagnostic test or a therapeutic intervention depending on the indication and/or diagnosis. 

Video assisted thoracic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical approach, in which an endoscope is inserted into the right or left chest (similar to simple thoracoscopy) to visualize other surgical instruments which are placed through several additional small (usually 0.5 to 1.2cm) ports. It is similar to laparoscopic surgery for the abdomen, except in the chest. It is considered a less invasive approach to performing some thoracic surgeries. 

Both thoracoscopy and VATS are becoming more and more common in medical and surgical practice, because they offer direct visualization inside of the chest therefore potentially providing more information to help diagnose or treat a condition, and in the case of surgery it is less invasive, usually leading to quicker recovery and less pain.

I highly recommend speaking to your physician about thoracoscopy or VATS prior to undergoing the procedure(s) and discussing the full risks, benefits and alternatives.  "
Can biopsies be performed during a thoracoscopy?,"A thoracoscopy is a surgical procedure used to view structures within the thorax, without having to break or open the rib cage.  It was developed so that surgeons could have access to tissue, and perform simple procedures in a non-invasive manner.  Often thoracoscopies are used as a method of obtaining a biopsy of a specific tissue or tumor that the <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> is concerned about.  Sometimes they are used to take a biopsy of the lung tissue that may aide in the diagnosis of a lung condition.  Sometimes, the doctor will find something inside your chest that he or she will want to remove.  Sometimes the removal is possible and sometimes it isn't.  Thus, I don't think you can be guaranteed that this will be your only procedure.  Your doctor obviously hopes this is your only procedure or else they would have just scheduled you for an open surgery.  

Thoracoscopies are generally performed by surgeons that have specialized in thoracic surgery (not <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologists</a>).  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> you have chosen for this procedure.  The two of you can discuss the goals of the procedure and what reasonable benefits can be expected so that you can compare them to the risks.  Good luck.  "
Will I be sedated during my thoracoscopy?,"You should direct all of your questions about an upcoming thoracoscopy to the <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who will be operating on you.  This is a major surgery and it is very normal to have many questions or concerns about the procedure.  Your surgeon will be able to give you more of the details about the exact procedure for your surgery based on the reason for it.  In addition, if there are specific concerns about the anesthesia component, you will have a pre-operative evaluation with the <a href=""/anesthesiologists"">anesthesiologist</a> performing your anesthesia, either the morning of surgery once you arrive at the hospital or sometimes before that if you have any other health issues that might make anesthesia complicated.

Thoracoscopy is a major surgery and you will absolutely be under general anesthesia--this is the ""being put under"" that you refer to. Local anesthesia is what happens when the area is topically numbed and the patient is awake, but that would never, ever, ever be done for thoracic surgery.  You will be given medications to make you comfortable and then be put to sleep after which a tube will be put down your throat and into your lungs, enabling the anesthesiologist to maintain very close control over your breathing while using the power anesthetics that will keep you asleep for the surgery.

Again, please discuss with your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> for more information."
Is spirometry needed to diagnose emphysema?,"Emphysema is one of the major forms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD); the other major form is Chronic <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">Bronchitis</a>. Emphysema refers to the destruction of the small airways over time, and Chronic Bronchitis refers to a cough that lasts several months each year that is associated with sputum production. 

COPD is a major adverse side effect of smoking, and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. People with COPD experience shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue, and they are also more prone to respiratory infections. 

The gold standard for diagnosing COPD is through pulmonary function testing, of which <a href=""/procedure/spirometry-1234"">spirometry</a> is the major component. The test involves various measurements, including the volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled with each breath and with maximum effort, and the flow of air with forced expiration. The diagnosis of COPD can be made if a certain degree of an obstructive air flow pattern is seen on this test. The severity of the COPD can be estimated based on the amount of air expelled in one second after full inspiration. 

If you are concerned about COPD or have further questions about pulmonary function tests, then you should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to gain more information."
What is scintigraphy?,"Scintigraphy is a type of nuclear medicine imaging study. It is based on the ability of gamma probe cameras to detects radioactively labeled molecules within the body. Usually, a patient is asked to inhale radionucleatide labeled molecules and a picture is taken with special cameras which visualize the lungs while the radioisotopes are distributed within the lungs. If there is an area of the lung where inhaled air is not getting to then the most of the lung will ""enhance,"" however the area that did not get the inhaled substance will not. This can help localize a shunt or an area of the lung that is considered ""dead space"" which is to say it is not being ventilated. Depending on the reasoning behind why the test is being ordered, a special IV fluid labeled with another radio-labeled substance (for example, radiolabeled albumin) may also be used. 

Because lung scintigraphy is used for different things (e.g. detection of PE scans vs pre-operative evaluation for lung transplant), the way in which the test is done may differ slightly as well with respect to how much and through which route the radio-labeled material is administered into the body. 

I recommend discussing the test and its indications with your physician or <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a>. "
Can an abnormal pulmonary functioning test mean I have something wrong with my lungs?,"You are very correct that pulmonary function testing is used to identify abnormalities in the lungs or (as the name implies!) with lung function.  The test itself is very simple and not distressing.  A technologist will ask you to breathe into a mouthpiece (both normal breathing and a so-called 'forced expiration' where you will breathe out as hard as you can), and a machine will measure and record how air moves into and out of your lungs.  Pulmonary function tests (or PFTs) can give a physician a lot of information about not only the exchange of gases in the lungs (what they are supposed to be doing) but also the way in which your muscles function to help you take a deep breath.  

There are many different disease processes that can result in abnormal PFTs, and if your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> thinks that you need PFTs, he or she is probably trying to evaluate something about how you breathe.  However, PFTs are NOT the primary way of evaluating for lung cancer and you shouldn't <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> that this is why your physician has ordered the tests.  Most commonly, PFTs are used to evaluate people with <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> or emphysema.  In addition, your doctor will go over all of the results with you so that you can ask all of your questions. Please discuss further with your doctor for more information."
Can I smoke before a pulmonary functioning test?,"<a href=""/procedure/pulmonary-function-testing-218"">Pulmonary function testing</a> is designed to look at how well your lungs are working.  The test is done as a part of a workup for people that are having problems with their breathing.  The test is performed by having you blow air into a tube several times to measure the amount of air your lungs can hold, and the speed at which you inhale and exhale the air.  

Pulmonary function testing is used as a diagnostic tool to diagnose many different types of lung diseases.  Whether or not you smoked on the same day as the test will not effect most of the results.  The only result that it will possibly effect is your diffusion capacity test, which is part of the pulmonary function testing.  Smoking the same day will alter the results.  Most of the measurements will be affected by the cumulative effect of your smoking over the years, not what you did that day.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> prior to the pulmonary function testing.  You can discuss what the test is likely to show and what additional benefit you may gain from having the test.  You can discuss the smoking issue, but your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> is likely to tell you to stop smoking if you can.  This is not because of the test, but rather because that is the best decision you can make for your health.  "
What do pulmonary functioning tests measure?,"<a href=""/procedure/pulmonary-function-testing-218"">Pulmonary function testing</a> is a tool used by <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctors</a> that is designed to look at the functionality of your lungs.  The test consists of you blowing air into a tube several times.  The test measures your lung volume (amount of air you can hold) and your speed of getting air in and getting air out.  In addition, you may be asked to breath in a small amount of a special gas which will measure your lung volume and your lung's ability to get oxygen into your body and carbon dioxide out of your body.  You may also be asked to inhale a medication (such as albuterol) which can help you breath easier and may help in figuring out what is wrong with your lungs.  The test is not painful and can even be a little fun.  Depending on what is being tested, it often takes about a half hour.  

The type of doctor who administers and reads a pulmonary function test is a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your pulmonologist.  He or she should be able to explain the purpose of your pulmonary function test in the context of your symptoms and your suspected condition.  I hope that answer helped.  Good luck. "
How often should smokers have lung cancer screenings?,"As you already know, smoking markedly increases your risk for lung cancer.  You are right to have cancer ""at the back of [your] mind,"" but you should even more strongly think about quitting smoking.  Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, who can help to guide you through this process. In the past few years the medical field has come up with lots of new medications and modes of therapy to help patients quit.

There have been many studies looking at whether or not smokers should be screened for cancer.  Studies have looked at doing regular chest x-rays, regular CT scans, or even bronchoscopies (putting a camera down into the lung to look at the airways).  None of these studies have shown that regularly screening smoking patients for lung cancer helps to decrease the risk of death from it.  The reason is that lung cancer is very aggressive.  Other cancers (like colon cancer for which we do colonoscopies), when caught ""early"" can have curative therapy (like taking out that part of the colon).  Lung cancer, even if caught on a ""screening"" chest <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a>, is likely to have spread locally in the lung, to nearby lymph nodes, or to other organs.  Thus, current recommendations are NOT to screen for lung cancer, even in smokers.  

If you have any symptoms (difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, chest pain), you should see your primary care physician or a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> right away."
What does a peak expiratory flow rate measure?,"Peak expiratory flow is a measure of how quickly a person can move air out of their lungs.  A peak flow rate will be higher when a person's lungs are functioning normally and will drop if there is constriction in the airways, as classically occurs with <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a>. 

If you son is having his peak flow measured, it sounds like his physician may be concerned that he has asthma.  There are several advantages to measuring peak flow, and it can be used to help adjust asthma medications, including inhalers.  Peak flow is typically measured using a small handheld device that patients can keep with them at home.  Although peak flow is not used to diagnose asthma, it can be used to help monitor it.  Asthmatic patients are encouraged to check their peak flow every day--after checking for a few days while feeling well, patients get a sense of what their normal range is.  Regular monitoring of peak flow can help identify when an asthma flare may be starting.  In addition, if a patient with asthma starts feeling short of breath, the degree to which the peak flow drops can give a measure of how severe the flare is which can then help determine the level of additional care that is needed.  

Your son may or may not be prescribed an inhaler after his peak flow test, but it is likely that he will be given his own peak flow meter to check at home."
What weather conditions bring out asthma symptoms?,"As you indicate, the weather can often play a role in aggravating (or sometimes helping) with <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> symptoms.  Asthma is part of a family of disorders known as reactive airway disease--and as the name suggests, the symptoms of an asthma attack are caused by overactive airways.  Many different things can be triggers for the constriction of the airways that causes shortness of breath and wheezing in asthma, and weather conditions can be one of them.  The important thing to remember is that what sets off your asthma may be different than that of someone else, so if you can identify a pattern for your symptoms it is important for you to make a note of this.  

Studies in the emergency room have shown that often extreme weather (very hot or very cold) can lead to an increase of asthma symptoms in the community.  Hot, dry air can often do the same thing--it sounds as though this may be true for you.  In addition, changes in barometric pressure (often caused by storm fronts, such as the thunderstorms of the summer); extreme wind (thought to increase the number of fungal spores in the air); or hot, humid air (increasing mold spores, possibly combining with chemicals in the air to increase the concentration of pollutants) can all trigger asthma exacerbations."
Who is at risk of getting COPD?,"Yes - you are absolutely at much higher risk. 

<a href=""/procedure/copd-389"">COPD</a> (or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a degenerative condition of the lungs in which tissue breaks down, usually due to chronic inflammation induced by smoking. There are also rarer forms of COPD which can be inherited, but virtually all COPD comes from smoking. 

The fact that you are an active smoker puts you at much higher risk of developing COPD than the general non smoking population. The fact that you have a family history of COPD is also concerning, because this means that your family genetics may be more susceptible to the damage causes by smoking than other families (it could just mean that you have had many heavy smokers in the family). 

Stopping smoking is absolutely critical for your health. Not only will this slow the damage to your lungs and potentially prevent the development of COPD (or lung cancer) but it will also halt the many other harmful effects of smoking that put you at extremely elevated risk of other conditions as well, such as heart attacks and strokes. 

If you are interested in quitting smoking, you should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. There are multiple approaches to quitting that they can discuss with you. "
What is COPD?,"<a href=""/procedure/copd-389"">COPD</a> (an abbreviation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a degenerative condition of the lungs in which air is trapped in the tubes of the lungs, impairing breathing. The condition usually develops slowly over decades, and it is usually provoked by smoking, although other problems including a rare inherited condition, can also cause it. It would be very very unlikely for someone who is 27 years old to have COPD, unless it was due to the rare inherited form. 

It is much more likely that you have another condition going on. You should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible, rather than relying on relatives to diagnose your conditions! 

A lung condition that would be more common in someone your age would be <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a>, but there are a number of non-lung conditions that would also need to be ruled out in a young person with trouble breathing, including anemia and various heart problems. When you go to your doctor, you should tell them about any problems with exercise, any chest pain, any dizziness or passing out, any palpitations, any cough or wheeze, any weight loss, any swelling in your ankles, as well as any other symptoms that you think are concerning. "
Are bronchoscopys very painful?,"Sorry to hear that you are having to undergo a <a href=""/procedure/bronchoscopy-217"">bronchoscopy</a>. This is a complete assumption, but the fact that you asked some questions on a forum probably means that you are at least relatively nervous about having it done. Hopefully I can decrease any <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> that may be there by giving you some information. 

First of all, bronchoscopy can be performed a number of different ways...there are two main categories of different types of bronchoscopes that can be used: rigid, and flexible. Historically all bronchoscopy was performed using rigid scopes. These are straight scopes that the physician looks through with their naked eye. This form of bronchoscopy has generally been replaced by flexible bronchoscopy save for a few different situations. Some physicians still choose to use the rigid bronchoscope in pediatric patients, when removing foreign bodies (although the flexible bronchoscope can do this as well), in airway emergencies, and when the patient needs to be ventilated for a significant period of time during bronchoscopy. (This is not an all inclusive list...just to give you an idea). Flexible bronchoscopy is much more common and uses a camera and flexible fiberoptic scope which can be passed down the bronchial tree without significant distortion of the normal anatomy. 

Most of the time this procedure is done under conscious sedation, so the patient is completely comfortable, and breathing on their own. They are typically given versed which causes anterograde amnesia, meaning that the patient shouldn't remember much of anything that was done. The alternative is to have the bronch done under general anesthesia, where you will definitely not feel anything, and the <a href=""/anesthesiologists"">anesthesiologist</a> will be ventilating you (not breathing spontaneously like conscious sedation). Either situation you should be completely comfortable. You may have a sore throat for a few days afterwards from the scopes, but this generally isn't terrible. Nonetheless I recommend talking to your physician if you are still worried about the bronch. Good luck. Hope this helps. "
Could my bronchitis really be lung cancer?,"The unfortunate problem with smoking (in addition to the many negative health effects it has, including heart, lung, and other complications) is that you begin to wonder if every sign and symptom that you experience is an indication that you have a hidden cancer growing somewhere. Unfortunately, in order to confirm that you simply have bronchitis rather than something more serious, you will need to speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who might choose to order an <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a>. 

Smokers are more likely to have bronchitis than are non-smokers, in part because of the fact that the many toxins in tobacco smoke impair the lung's ability to clean themselves of the junk that is in the air. Additionally, it impairs the lung's ability to fight infection. Generally, bronchitis will resolve over time, while lung cancer would be expected to have more and more symptoms and problems. Associated complaints such as <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, night sweats, fatigue, etc would also make it more concerning that you might have a malignant cause of your cough. Please discuss your concerns and symptoms with your primary care doctor, and also please discuss with him or her your desire to stop smoking and start living a healthier lifestyle. "
Why do I still experience shortness of breath over a year after recovering from Swine Flu?,"The fact that you are still having shortness of breath this long after overcoming a serious <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> that required hospitalization suggests that you are in need of continued follow up with your physician. Hospitalization is a very difficult thing on the body, as remaining in the hospital bed all day, every day in and of itself can lead to significant muscle loss. This deconditioning that occurs can then compromise your recovery, and make you feel that you are not quite back to your normal self. 

In these cases, working with a physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or personal trainer, after getting the ok from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, can help you to return to your pre-illness form and stamina. Other things that can cause you to feel short of breath are numerous, and include obstruction of your airway from scar tissue, although this is much less likely. Alternatively, other medical issues can also lead to shortness of breath. For that reason, you should speak to your primary care doctor about all of your symptoms and concerns, and develop a plan, possibly including further testing or increased physical activity/therapy, that will help you make sure there is nothing more causing your symptoms, and that you recover fully. "
What are the symptoms of COPD?,"Being sick as many times as you are describing is concerning for someone your age, especially as you are a nonsmoker.  It is very important for you to see your primary care provider who might refer you to a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> (lung specialist) to discuss your frequent infections and symptoms.  COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, includes emphysema and chronic <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a> or both. It is usually caused by long-term smoking.  It is very rare in those less than 40 and even more rare in young nonsmokers.  However, it can happen to those who have a rare genetic disorder called alpha -1 - antitrypsin deficiency.  It makes the lungs and liver very sensitive to damage and can lead to a diagnosis of COPD in even healthy nonsmokers in their 20s.  It is possible that you have developed <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a>, which is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by shortness of breath and wheezing.  It makes recovering from respiratory illnesses much more difficult.  It is also possible that you were just unlucky and had a bad year but I would highly suggest you rule out more serious conditions such as I discussed above as well as cystic fibrosis and immune disorders.  In the meantime, avoid any exposure to smoke and other irritants."
Why do I have shortness of breath during certain seasons?,"This sounds like a very distressing problem.  The most common cause of this type of problem is <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> and thus, I think that you should have this cause officially ruled in or ruled out.  It is important to have this evaluation because your treatment depends on it.  From my perspective, I cannot tell whether your breathing doesn't respond to the inhaler because you need a stronger medicine (if your asthma was severe), or if you don't have asthma at all  The fact that your symptoms are worse in the winter makes asthma slightly less likely, but doesn't rule it out.  Another problem that should be looked into is vocal cord dysfunction.  This is a common issue in young women where the vocal cords move in the wrong direction when inhaling making breathing in very difficult.  Vocal cord dysfunction is often misdiagnosed as asthma.  

The next best step is for you to take is to schedule an appointment with a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>.  He or she can take a more detailed history of your symptoms and perform a thorough lung exam.  Finally, the pulmonologist can perform <a href=""/procedure/pulmonary-function-testing-218"">pulmonary function testing</a> with bronchodilatory challenge (gold standard for diagnosing asthma).  With this approach, you can find out for sure what's wrong with your breathing.  "
What  makes a woman have chest pain and trouble breathing?,"Anyone who presents with symptoms of dry coughing with trouble drawing deep breaths should be evaluated for asthma, bronchitis, and a few other conditions.  In your case, I think that asthma should be the first thing to be ruled out.  Although it would be a bit unusual, it is not unheard of for a previously asymptomatic middle aged women to develop asthma.  To rule out asthma, you will need to have pulmonary function tests with a bronchodilatory challenge.  This involves measuring the rate of air entry and exit from your lungs and changes in that flow rate with an inhaler.  Your symptoms are also consistent with bronchitis, a viral infection in the lungs which causes cough and shortness of breath.  These symptoms usually do not extend past a few weeks so you history of 2 months of symptoms is not really consistent.  Another possibility is pleurisy.  Pleurisy is inflammation in the lining of the lung.  It can be associated with cough and a viral <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>.  Symptoms also include trouble taking a deep breath, but this is usually because taking a deep breath is painful.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can take a more detailed history of your symptoms and perform a thorough lung exam.  Perhaps you will warrant a referral to a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> for pulmonary function testing.  Good luck.  "
What causes coughing and trouble breathing?,"In kid's your son's age, shortness of breath should be looked at closely.  You have taken the right first steps to have you son evaluated for asthma, which is one of the more common causes of cough and shortness of breath.  Make sure that your son has had a full evaluation including pulmonary function testing with bronchdilatory challenge (needed for asthma diagnosis).  A simple history of his symptoms may not be sufficient to rule asthma out.  Cough and shortness of breath can also occur because of bronchitis.  If your son's symptoms occur during times when he was otherwise not feeling well this could explain his symptoms.  Your son should be evaluated for vocal cord dysfunction.  This occurs when the vocal cords paradoxically shut instead of open when the person breaths in.  The symptoms that occur is difficulty getting a breath in, and subsequent shortness of breath.  It is often mistaken for asthma.  Although it is rare in young people, these symptoms could also be heart failure.  This, obviously would be very unusual.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>.  You can discuss your son's work up this far, and ask what additional diagnostic tests will be done.  Your son may benefit from referral to a pediatric <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> (lung <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a>).  "
Does asthma cause fatigue?,"Asthma is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the airways which causes attacks of wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.  It is a common condition and ranges from mild to debilitating.  It is very possible that your asthma is associated with your fatigue, especially if it is not well controlled.  If your airways are continually inflamed then your body is having to work extra hard to take every break, and as you know, your body never takes a break from breathing.  All this extra work can lead to noticeable fatigue.  A good way to think about it is to picture going through life only being able to breath through a straw - exhausting!  It is very important to make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a> to determine that your asthma is being optimally treated.  You will likely have a PFT (pulmonary function test) test or <a href=""/procedure/spirometry-1234"">spirometry</a> to evaluate your lung function.  Besides making sure you are on the appropriate medications and dosages it is also important to avoid all environmental triggers such as cigarette smoke and dust.  There is also the possibility that the medication you are using to treat your asthma could be contributing to your fatigue as this is a common side effect of many medications."
Why does asthma cause one to cough?,"<a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">Asthma</a> is a very common medical problem and also one of the most common reasons for people to seek medical care. The <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctors</a> who are well qualified to discuss this issue with you in greater detail include your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.   Asthma has two features which lead to the symptoms. The first is constriction of the tube in the lungs and the second is inflammation and the buildup of mucus in the tubes. The constriction is what primarily gives the symptoms of wheeze and shortness of breath, whereas the inflammation and mucus is what primarily gives the symptoms of cough.   In other words, the cough in asthma is just like any cough. The mucus and inflammation stimulate nerve endings in the lung, which provokes the cough, whose job is to try to keep the tubes of the lungs free of blockage.   Unfortunately, asthma is a chronic disease and there is no better treatment for it than the daily use of controlling medications.   As always the diagnosis and the management of your particular concerns will require a physical examination by your personal physician. If you have persistent cough, this means your asthma is probably not well controlled and you should set up a visit with your primary care doctor as soon as possible. "
Why does pneumonia cause coughing?,"<a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">Pneumonia</a> is an infection of the lungs, usually by bacteria or viruses. It usually requires medical treatment and evaluation. The doctors who will be well qualified to discuss this issue with you in greater detail include your wife's <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care </a><a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a>.   Cough is a common symptom in pneumonia. It is caused by the inflammation and irritation of the passages in the lungs, which is sensed by small nerve endings which trigger the cough. As you say, the likely origin of the cough reflex is to bring material out of the lungs to protect them.   However, the actually amount of material that comes out of the lungs depends a lot on what type of pneumonia it is. There are some bacterial pneumonias, often called 'lobal pneumonias' which tend to produce a lot of inflammation and generate a lot of pus - these usually result in productive cough. However, 'atypical pneumonias' generally cause enough inflammation to provoke a cough but not enough to cause the productive of significant sputum.   As always the diagnosis and the management of your wife's particular condition will require a physical examination by her personal physician. If her symptoms are not improving, setting up a visit with her primary care doctor is highly recommended. "
Can coughing make one spit up blood clots?,"Coughing blood is a major and serious concern. I strongly encourage you to see your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> emergently. Depending on your medical history and the quantity you may even need to go straight to the emergency room. This is not normal.

Coughing up blood is medically known as hemoptysis. This occurs when inflammation in the airway causes the lung's blood vessels to breakdown and leak into the airways. There can be both minor and major causes of this. Minor causes include <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a> or other viral infections. However, there are many serious causes of this. Serious infections like aspergillous or tuberculosis can cause it. Regular <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a> can cause this as well. Lung cancer is an important cause as well.  Inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis are also often implicated. Clotting conditions like pulmonary embolism also can be the causative problem.

Regardless of the cause, the effect of blood in the airways is concerning. If the blood is not coughed up but goes down the airways--this can fill up the lung. People with massive hemoptysis can drown in their own blood.

There are minor causes of hemoptysis as mentioned above. Another common thing to rule out is that it is actually hemoptysis and not simply blood coming from the mouth (gums, etc).

I would strongly encourage you to see your doctor urgently."
How do dry coughs and wet coughs differ?,"Wet coughs and dry coughs are similar processes. They can however suggest a different cause of the cough. Regardless, if you have a persistent cough you should see your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a> to diagnose the condition and potentially treat it.

The cough reflex is a normal process. Irritation in the airways cause the body to start a cough, in an attempt to clear the airways. What causes the irritation is important as this is the true cause of the cough.

A wet cough (and by that I mean one that produces sputum), is a hint that the cough is caused by inflammation. For example, a <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a> (or an infection of the lungs by a bacteria, virus or fungus) causes pus to form in the airways and the cough the can clear the inflammation and therefore the cough is wet.

A dry cough can be caused by other types of irritation. For example, irritants like cigarette smoke can cause a cough without the inflammation and therefore there is no sputum. Other causes of dry cough include <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a>, acid reflux or other medicines. There are many others.

This rule is not 100%. For example, some people have a pneumonia yet cannot bring up the pus so it is a dry cough. It is just a hint your doctor can use. In general, we are more worried about wet coughs. 

Knowing the cause of the cough is the only way to know how to treat it. Talk to your doctor."
Is coughing always a sign of illness?,"Cough can have many different causes and the specialists involved in diagnosing and treating a cough can include a general practitioner, <a href=""/internists"">internist</a>, <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>, ENT and others.

Generally we cough in order to clear our airways of foreign objects. The urge to cough is from irritation that can either occur chemically or physically.  The majority of times that people can cough can be caused by infectious processes such as viruses and bacteria. Other things that can cause cough include chemical irritants such as pollutions, aerosols and even perfumes. Drugs can also cause cough by releasing chemicals in our body that make our lung airways constrict and cause an urge to cough. Gastric esophageal reflux and post nasal drip are also common causes of cough. 

More serious causes of cough includes cardiac etiologies. Sometimes people with heart failure can have fluid accumulate in the lungs and cause what we call a cardiac cough. Malignancy, although not that common can also present with cough.

While a pulmonologist and ENT specialist can help diagnose the causes of a cough it is important to be evaluated by your primary care provider initially. A careful physical exam and history can often times diagnose the cause. 

"
What causes insomnia?,"Insomnia is an extremely complex problem that we as physicians have only limited understanding of.  I'll give you a quick run down and some suggestions.    Insomnia can have many causes.  If you drink any caffeinated beverages after 12:00PM, then you may have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.  Patients that report frequent wakening with difficulty falling back asleep sometimes are suffering from depression.  This will be a consideration when you present the problem to a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a>.  If this isn't the case then you may be having trouble getting back to sleep because you know you've had trouble in the past.  Consider using white noise, and removing any clocks from the room so you are not reminded what time it is.  Finally, if you snore, you may have sleep apnea which can also result in frequent awakenings.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment with you <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  You can discuss some of your symptoms and some of the strategies to get better sleep.  It is important that you don't try to live with this problem because your quality of life will improve with better sleep.  If he or she thinks you have a disorder such as sleep apnea, they may refer you to a <a href=""/sleep-medicine-specialists"">sleep specialist</a>.  Good luck.  "
Does the common cold always come with a cough?,"The common cold does often occur with a cough. If you are currently experiencing cold symptoms or are having recurrent cold symptoms--I would suggest you see a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who could help answer your question.

The common cold refers, in general, to a viral infection that causes inflammation of the sinuses, nose and lungs. This inflammation often gives the symptoms of a runny nose, stuffed up sinuses and cough. The reason we cough is because the inflammation in the airways causes irritation in the airways. Our body has irritation receptors in our airways, that if they sense irritation, they trigger a cough. The cough is a defense mechanism that we have developed to clear the airways so that adequate air flow can occur. That is to say, that the cough is a symptom and not the disease itself. In fact, the cough is a defense mechanism. Therefore to cure the common cold we cannot simply just stop the cough...we need to figure out how to treat the cause--which is the virus. Unfortunately, we are not very good at identifying viruses, let alone treating them. We in fact can, with some success, suppress a cough fairly well with various medications such as tessalon pearls or other suppressants.

The common cold is caused by a virus which often results in a cough. Talk to your primary doctor if you have further questions."
What are the symptoms of pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is serious medical condition. It is best evaluated and treated by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, a <a href=""/pulmonologists"">pulmonologist</a>, or by an emergency room physician.

Pneumonia is an infection in the lower part of the lungs. People with pneumonia have a cough. It is usually a wet cough that produces green, yellow, or blood stained sputum. Occasionally, patients can have a dry cough instead. Because it is an infection, pneumonia generally causes people to run a fever as well. Along with the fever, people with pneumonia sometimes have shaking chills. In older people, all of the symptoms may not be apparent, and they may seem more lethargic. 

Pneumonia cannot be diagnosed only based on these symptoms. If you suspect that you have pneumonia, you should visit your <a href=""/pulmonologists"">doctor</a>. Your doctor will ask you some questions and examine you. If necessary, your doctor will order a chest x-ray and basic blood tests. That will help them determine if your symptoms are due to pneumonia or another condition. "
Why does smoke cause one to cough?,"In those people who have smoked for long periods of time, the lungs eventually become coated by the chemicals in the cigarettes. There are small hair cells that line the wind pipes as they extend into the lungs which are constantly working to move small particles out of the lungs so that they can come high enough within the bronchial tree to get coughed out. With chronic smoking, these hair cells become overloaded by the chemicals and by products from the cigarette so that they stop working or have decreased functionality. When you stop smoking, the hair cells are able to start moving the tar and chemicals out of the deeper parts of the lungs. As the tar and chemicals get pushed higher in the bronchial tree, they cause you to cough and produce copious amounts of sputum. It is the chemicals being expelled from the lungs that cause the wet cough that long term smokers get after they quit smoking. There are many benefits to quitting smoking and many support groups to help with this endeavor, which are outside the scope of this discussion. See your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for more information about smoking cessation and its long-term benefits.      "
Is dry air better for a cough?,"In general, a cough can be a sign of a mild, self resolving condition or a severe medical <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>. If your ""rough"" cough is unusually severe or continues you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Fevers, shortness of breath or bringing up unusual colored sputum with your cough are other red flags that should warrant seeing your primary doctor.

A cough is a reflex that the body has developed to clear the airways. This is often triggered by inflammation in the airways. There is no good data to suggest that having a humid or dry air would be better for all types of cough. It is unknown how humidity in the air would effect your cough. I doubt it has much effect as your body humidifies and warms the air in the mouth prior to it entering the lungs. So what your actual airways see probably does not reflect the type of ambient air your breathe in. 

Theoretically, if the inflammation is caused by irritation to the mouth or upper airways from the air (which can occur to smokers) then it may be possible that more humid air could be soothing the the airways. On the other hand, if the cough is caused by inflammation from an infection (such as in a <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a>), then it is possible that the dry air would be better for the clearance of a cough (as humid air would be a better medium for the bacteria to grow). However, this is all guessing...it has never been shown that air humidity affect cough. We do know that humidified air is felt by some to be easier to breath, however how it effects cough is unknown.

To answer your question---we don't know. I hope your cough clears. If not, I would strongly recommend seeing your doctor."
Does the medicine Adderall contain amphetamines?,"Questions about starting a new medication or concerns about your attention span or ability to concentrate are general questions that are best answered by your primary care <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a>.

To answer your specific concern, the medication Adderall does contain two different forms of amphetamines.  Amphetamines can be addictive and should not be used to treat medical conditions without a physician's supervision, but Adderall itself can be very effective in the treatment of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (also known as ADHD).

If you feel that you are not able to concentrate or focus on activities in a way that is disrupting your ability to work or handle higher education, you should consult your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for a more detailed evaluation.  Your doctor can take a more detailed history and physical exam to try to assess whether this is a new change in your overall health or whether this might be an issue that goes back to childhood.  Adults can have ADHD, and recognizing and treating this condition appropriately is important.  

There are also strategies for improving concentration that can be used by anyone, whether or not they also have other conditions that may affect their ability to focus. Getting enough and quality sleep; maintaining a healthy, balanced died; and avoiding distractions when working can all be very helpful.  Medications to improve concentration should only be prescribed by a physician after determining that there is a medical reason to treat a condition that may result in decreased concentration."
Why is it that I never feel fully awake? ,"There are many reasons that you could be feeling more fatigued than usual, but you should see a physician in person to make the correct diagnosis. The fact that you are already sleeping 15 hours a day suggests that you are sleeping adequately, but there are several more issues that need to be resolved. While you don't state your age, the fact that you are on a volleyball team suggests that you are likely young and active. One common cause of increased fatigue among such people is infectious mononucleosis, or mono, which is also known as the ""kissing disease,"" as it is passed often in this manner. It takes quite a while to resolve (weeks, usually), and athletes need to avoid contact for some time, as splenic rupture is a well known complication. 
Other possibilities, if you are older, usually, include <a href=""/procedure/sleep-apnea-223"">sleep apnea</a>. If you hear from others that you snore quite a bit and you wake in the night, or stop breathing for short spells (apneas), then you could be suffering from sleep apnea. Being overweight and having a family history of this condition would make this more likely. While you would be sleeping adequately, the quality of your sleep would be poor. 
Finally, there are thousands of other reasons that you could be sleepy. You should see a physician quickly, as some of them are serious, some can be treated, and a direct, in person consultation, is the only way to know which is the cause in your specific case. "
Why is the pad under my big toe hurting and sometimes swollen?,"Your big toe is an important structure as it bears the brunt of the force when walking and helps to maintain balance.  Therefore, pain in this area can cause significant disability and it is important to get it checked out by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a <a href=""/podiatrists"">podiatrist</a>.  The causes of big toe pain range from benign to more serious.  One of the most common causes of foot and toe pain is ill-fitting shoes.  Make sure that your shoes have adequate room and are not squeezing the widest part of your foot or pinching anywhere.  Hallux rigidus is the medical term for pain and stiffness in the joint of your big toe.  It can be treated conservatively but sometimes progresses to the point that <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> is indicated.  Bunions are also a common cause of pain in the big toe.  Bunions are characterized by enlargement at the base of the big toe caused by inflammation of the fluid filled sac known as a bursa.  Often the symptoms of bunions can be alleviated by orthotics and wearing wider shoes but sometimes surgery is needed.  In the interim until you see your doctor, try taking tylenol or advil to alleviate pain, ice your toe a few times a day and keep it elevated as much as possible to help with swelling,"
Why is my hair getting so greasy?,"Unfortunately, it is difficult to answer your question to any helpful degree without more information. Increased oil production in your hair (and the rest of your body) can sometimes be associated with changes in hormone levels. That obviously brings up questions such as whether or not there have been other notable changes in the same time span, i.e., did you start a new <a href=""/procedure/birth-control-contraception-129"">birth control</a> method? Did you become pregnant? Have you had changes in your menstrual cycle or had sudden shifts in your weight? All of these are just a few of the questions that would need to be answered before there is any acceptable answers to give you. As for whether or not there is something really wrong with you, it is unlikely that such is the case in the absence of other symptoms, but you really should follow up with a physician in person who can ask you all of the questions that are important to answer. 
As for things that you can do in the time that you are waiting until you can get in to see your physician, try leaving your shampoo on your head for a full 5 minutes after you lather up before you rinse it out. Also, avoid brushing your hair too frequently, as this can cause the oil to migrate from your scalp to the ends of your hair. 
"
When should children have skin tags removed?,"Your physicians are completely correct. The timing of when to have this removed is up to you as a parent, and there is not a significant amount of medical guidance that can be given about the optimal timing of removal. Removing skin tags is a very benign procedure, and is usually done with curved scissors in your doctors office. Sometimes, your physician will place a small amount of material over the skin tag prior to cutting it off, just to help reduce bleeding. While there are other ways to remove these as well (such as freezing), often simple excision with surgical scissors is best.
The real crux of your question is whether or not you will harm your daughter by doing the procedure now, or if you would be better off waiting until later. Given your comment that the skin tag is near her eye, there could be some value in waiting until she is old enough to hold completely still. From the standpoint of scarring, usually the removal of a skin tag is so simple that there is very little, if any, scarring that is left after the procedure. There are other issues as well, such as the brief discomfort that she will feel, that must be considered. Consider to counsel with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or family practice doctor about optimal timing, and when he or she would feel most comfortable removing it. Alternatively, if you remain concerned since the tag is on her face, you could consider visiting a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> trained in facial plastics (either a <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">plastic surgeon</a> or otolaryngologist with facial plastics training) to completely optimize the outcome."
"""My little brother is 6 and is underweight, and doesn't like to eat almost ANYTHING, EVER. What can I do to help get his weight up? Is it normal for kids to get thin because they're so picky?""","You are raising an interesting question that is exceptionally pertinent in the United States, where so many of us are overweight. As a physician, and a parent of young children, it can be frustrating to deal with the extremely picky food choices of young children. There is a temptation to turn to the fatty, sweet, or salty foods that all children love to eat. This temptation is strengthened by the observation that some children seem to eat almost nothing. In general, giving high fat, high sugar, or high salt-content foods is not an appropriate course of action. Rather, providing many options, repeatedly, will allow children to make healthy choices and develop an adequate diet that does not revolve around a few choice ""junk food"" items. While good health habits should be encouraged, eating for the sake of eating--even if it means junk food--should not be encouraged. Over time, healthy options will prevail when presented appropriately.
When you mention that your brother is underweight, it does raise the question of malnutrition. If you believe that your brother is not developing appropriately, in height, weight, or other measurements, you should seek the help of a physician or <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a>. There are reasons that could be contributing to this that are more negative than just picky eating. Your brother should still be having an <a href=""/procedure/annual-physical-76"">annual physical</a> exam with his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, which would be an excellent option to compare his growth and discuss these concerns.  "
Is it true that some kinds of juices can cause sinus irritation in kids?,"It would be important to clarify what you mean by ""sinus irritation,"" and how soon after they eat or drink these things the symptoms occur. Do your children have runny noses after they drink these certain types of juice, or is there more (rashes, headaches, etc)? Are the problems constant? Are the other foods that cause a similar effect similar to the juice in any way (i.e., are they fruit or other things with the same ingredients as they juice)? Do your children have any allergies? 
The most likely answer to your question would be a food allergy. This is something that can be quickly tested, both by yourself in your home, as well as in the doctor's office. Food allergies are very common, and you can test your children by removing the offending foods and drinks from their diets. If the problem goes away, you might have just diagnosed a food allergy. As the problem seems relatively mild (a runny nose), you can try to introduce these foods after a few months to see if they still have the same symptoms.
From what you're describing, a visit to the <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> would be a good place to start. He or she will be able to direct you towards food modifications, and arrange testing to see what foods are likely to cause problems. They will also ask if anyone else in the family has allergies, asthma, or <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, as these are often related. And finally, being a little paranoid isn't such a bad thing."
Why would a child have toilet trouble at school?,"Gaining control of bladder function can be trying for young children, and it can also be difficult for parents who are trying to help them. Overall, a large percentage of your daughter's classmates will have similar problems from time to time, as high as 20%, with 3% of children having <a href=""/procedure/incontinence-1040"">incontinence</a> during the day at least weekly. The percentage of children with intermittent diurnal enuresis (the <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a> term for day time pant wetting) gradually decreased in one study, until only 5% had any daytime incontinence by the time they were 10. It is important to know if your daughter had previously been continent, and only began to have trouble as she started attending school. It is common for children, in new environments, to attempt to hold their urine for too long, which is obviously problematic. If such is the case, encouraging frequent trips to the restroom--before the urge comes--can solve the problem quickly.
That being said, most physicians would recommend a visit to the doctor--not a psychiatrist--for daytime incontinence that occurs beyond the age of 4. Urinary tract infections, constipation, and other problems can all cause incontinence in young children, and all can usually be quickly resolved with a simple visit to the doctor. Either way, he or she will be able to give you further direction based on the results of a physical exam and some simple lab tests. Your daughter will appreciate a quick resolution. And so will you."
Why does my skin look dirty?,"While it is always impossible to tell for certain without doing a physician exam and actually seeing your skin, your question is almost straight from a text book: type 2 diabetics, who are resistant to insulin, develop areas of darkened skin that look ""dirty."" No matter how much you wash the areas, they won't seem to lighten, because your skin is not dirty. Instead, for reasons that aren't entirely clear but probably have something to do with the growth factors that are changed and affected with insulin resistance, your skin has become darker in these areas. This disorder is called acanthosis nigricans, and will often develop in the folds of skin in those who will become diabetics or already are. It can also be associated with some malignancies, and so any persistent skin changes should be followed up with a physician. It would also be important to be working closely with a physician to keep your diabetes in check. While the changes to your skin might not hurt you in the long run, a lifetime of poorly controlled diabetes can be devastating to your heart, kidneys, eyes, and other organs. I would definitely advise making an appointment with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to review your health history and make appropriate changes to improve your health. "
What kind of bug bite is this?,"While it is difficult to say what kind of bug it was, the important part of your question is that the redness and whitehead are growing. In general, after a few days of swelling, small bites or other skin changes, should start to improve. In this era of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA, small insults to the skin can become infected with bacteria that are difficult for your body to eliminate, and are even more concerning because common antibiotics have some difficulty clearing these infections as well. 
Specific signs that you should look for that require seeing a <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a> immediately would be if you start to have a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, chills, or a fast heart rate, as all of these can be signs of a blood stream infection. It would also be important to see a doctor quickly if you start to have difficulty swallowing, breathing, turning your head, or with any other movement that could be caused by this infection. Another concerning sign would be if you start to feel that the skin around the bite is becoming fluctuant, or as if there is a fluid collection under the skin. If so, it would need to be lanced by a physician in order to heal completely. From what you're saying, you should see a physician at this point. 
Moist, warm compresses can sometimes help to soften up the skin and cause the whitehead to pop which can sometimes be the start of relief. In the meantime, see a physician to see what the next step is, which might include lancing and culturing any fluid to see if the bacteria growing in the wound is concerning. "
Bump on head?,"There are several things that this bump could be, but it would be impossible to tell you with any certainty exactly what it is without actually looking at it. One of the simplest ideas would be an epidermal inclusion cyst, known also as a sebaceous cyst or a wen. These are small bumps that can form, often on your head or neck, and can be somewhat tender, grow slowly, and are filled with a pus or cheese-like fluid that can be released or sometimes oozes spontaneously. Some people have a tendency to develop these, although it is not clear what causes them. The fact that they happen in areas of the body with sun exposure and can occur in areas where <a href=""/procedure/acne-86"">acne</a> is also present suggests that these could be factors for some people. If it is an epidermoid cyst, it can be incised and drained in your <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctors</a> office (although it may recur), or excised in a simple procedure which would be more definitive. 
Depending on your age, health history, and other risk factors, there are many other things that this bump could be as well, all of which would require a physical exam. In general, any growth or bump on your body should be examined by a physician, as it is difficult to say specifically if it is benign or something more concerning. 
"
What causes hyperlipidemia?,"Hyperlipidemia is a common problem. Unfortunately, over time this can be a serious condition that requires attention. I encourage you to talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who can better explain, evaluate and treat this situation.

Hyperlipidemia means there is an elevated level of lipids (or fats) in your blood. Cholesterol is one type of fat. It is probably the most important type.

As for what causes it, there are really two major causes. One is diet. Cholesterol and fats come from animal products. Meats, cheeses, milk, etc are prominently involved. For example, eating fried foods and lots of red meat can raise your cholesterol. The second major cause is genetics. Your family may or may not be predisposed to high cholesterol. These variations depend on how your body processes the cholesterol. Other diseases can also worsen cholesterol, such as thyroid problems or diabetes.

Regardless of cause, it is important to treat. The major number to look at is the LDL Cholesterol or low density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is the ""bad"" cholesterol. For otherwise healthy people this should be less than 160 mg/dl.

To fix this, diet control (see above) and exercise is important. Losing weight and eating healthy are very important. If this remains elevated medications are available.

Talk to your doctor. If left untreated you will be at higher risk for heart attacks, strokes and leg problems."
What causes psychological fatigue?,"Fatigue is a common problem and is characterized by a sense of complete exhaustion, weariness, or lack or energy and motivation.  It is common to feel a drop in energy around two o'clock in the afternoon due to circadian rhythms (your body's internal clock that controls sleep/wake cycles).  This is why many foreign countries take a ""siesta"" or nap during this time.  However, for most people, this dip in energy is temporary and they are able to continue on with their day.  It sounds like this ""running out of steam"" is more severe in your wife's case.  Fatigue is a common symptom for various diseases but does not indicate disease by itself.  It is very important for your wife to be seen by her primary care provider to discuss her fatigue and have a full examination.  Depending on the severity of the fatigue her <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a> may order follow up tests.  Some possible explanations for fatigue include <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>, anemia (low blood count), sleep disorders such as <a href=""/procedure/insomnia-1027"">insomnia</a>, and hypothyroidism.  If no medical cause is found for her fatigue there are some tactics to try to improve her afternoon period of tiredness.  Make sure she is getting a good night of sleep, have a lighter lunch that has plenty of protein, go for a brisk walk around 2pm, or have a small amount of caffeine around this time."
Does HIV cause yeast infections?,"Your questions is complicated. Yes, HIV can make a person more prone to all types of infections, including yeast infections. BUT, if you have had a negative HIV test, you are extremely unlikely to have HIV. The tests are extremely sensitive (which means that almost everyone who has an infection, has a positive test result). 
The test works by measuring the antibodies that your body makes to fight the infection. As soon as a virus is present in your body, infection fighting parts of your blood start making antibodies. These antibodies are then measured to tell you if you have HIV. There are some cases of false negative test results (extremely rare!), which usually occur in people who were only recently exposed to the virus. In these unfortunate people, the body has not had time to make enough antibodies for measurement. Again, this is extremely rare, and would only occur in people with very recent exposure (6 months after exposure is more than enough time for a test to be accurate). This is called the ""window period."" Newer versions of the HIV test have made this ""window"" even shorter by testing for parts of the virus directly. 
About your yeast infection: if you have recently had a negative HIV test (especially without recent exposure), it is VERY unlikely that your recurrent infection is because of HIV. Even so, you should seek the advice of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> if there are any questions about either HIV, recurrent yeast infections, or any other <a href=""/procedure/std-sexually-transmitted-disease-150"">STD</a>. "
Can hydrocortisone affect an HIV test?,"No. The HIV test most commonly used is a test that looks at blood counts of the antibody that the body makes to fight the virus. Addition of a steroid to your normal routine will not in any way change the presence of this antibody. There is a theoretical possibility that any immune suppression (such as occurs when a patient is taking a steroid) could cause the body to create less of these antibodies in attempts to fight the virus, but it would not be enough to affect the results of an HIV test, as they would still be present. Your body will make antibodies to fight viruses as long as it is able to do so. If you are a normal, healthy, person who functions adequately with only regular steroid injections but no side effects (such as regular, chronic infections that are extremely difficult to clear), your body is making antibodies and keeping you safe every day without you even knowing. So HIV tests will not be affected by hydrocortisone injections for almost everyone.
The newer generations of rapid HIV tests (Fourth generation) increase the number of infections detected by also testing for the presence parts of the virus directly instead of just the antibodies that are made by the body. (It takes some time for the body to respond to the infection, and so this decreases the time until a test can come back positive). For any rapid test, follow up tests for any positive result are even more accurate, albeit they take longer to get results. 
Remember, always practice safe sex habits and be honest with yourself. If you have any concern about HIV or any <a href=""/procedure/std-sexually-transmitted-disease-150"">STD</a>, you should consult with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> immediately to address all of your concerns."
What treats a small laceration in the finger?,"Lacerations and any <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> of an extremity such as the hand are more concerning than most little injuries to other body parts because of the potential for injury to the nerves and blood vessels that supply them. For this reason, it is always best to see a physician if there is any doubt about the laceration itself, and immediately see a <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a> if you have any inability to move your hand or fingers completely or there are any sensory deficits (you can feel touch). For extremely simple lacerations that are very superficial, there are several things that will help the wound to heal. Adequate blood flow is one of the most important, and so any peripheral vascular disease would slow down the process. Diabetes or other autoimmune diseases (or even taking a prescription steroid regularly) would also slow down the healing process. Advanced age can also be a factor in and of itself. Finally, too many bacteria can cause a wound to heal more slowly, which is why different people recommend different topical antibiotics, as you have mentioned in your question. Iodine, alcohol, and antibiotics that you take by mouth or intravenously all have the same basic effect: they decrease the amount of bacteria in the wound, allowing normal healing to take place. For most simple wounds, a topical antibiotic ointment that you can get over the counter, such as bacitracin, is completely adequate. Look out for signs of infection, such as increased redness, green or yellow discharge, or fever/chills, and see a physician if there is any doubt."
What are vascular masses?,"Your question indicates that you need to see a physician, and also helps to illustrate the pitfalls of answering questions over the internet instead of visiting a physician. While I am not sure exactly what you mean by a ""vascular mass,"" it is clear that you have multiple risk factors that can contribute to poor health and quality of life, and these should be addressed with a physician regularly. 
A vascular mass (when spoken to a physician) would be something growing on, near, or involving vasculature. Blood vessels comprise the vasculature of the body, and anything involving these would be a vascular mass. As there are obviously blood vessels throughout your entire body, any lump or bump that you are feeling could be a vascular mass. Without more information (at least the location of this ""vascular mass""), it is difficult to say anything more than that. 
Now, there are some ""vascular masses"" that would be more urgent than others. If your mass gives you pain, ""purrs"" like a cat, or you feel a pulsatile mass in your abdomen and have a family history of aortic aneurysms, those would be just a few significant issues. But regardless of the specifics, it is clear that you have poor health, and you have health questions. Please see a physician soon to address all of these issues, including your vascular mass. "
Does anger cause chest pain?,"You seem to be asking several questions here. The first, ""does anger cause chest pain?"" is the most important, as any chest pain (angina, in <a href=""/family-physicians"">doctor</a> speak) can be a sign of a heart attack, or insufficient blood flow to parts of your heart. When a person gets angry, their blood pressure and heart rate will rise, and the heart has to work harder. As this happens, if there is a blockage, parts of the heart will be deprived of oxygen, and people will start to feel a pain in their chest, jaw, or shoulder (among other symptoms, although some people have no symptoms at all). If you are experiencing chest pain, you should speak to a physician immediately. 
The second question is less urgent, and the answer is disappointing to most people. The unfortunate fact is that exercises will not cause the body to remove fat from any one spot more than another, just by changing the type of exercise. Situps or abdominal exercises WILL cause the underlying muscle to hypertrophy, or get bigger, which will make your stomach more firm and possibly look better. In order to remove the fat, however, you need to have a negative energy balance, meaning that you need to burn more calories than you consume. 
Again, the most important question is your chest pain. Please speak to a doctor immediately if you are feeling chest pain. "
I think I might have erectile dysfunction during intercourse; should I be seriously concerned? ,"I would definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. <a href=""/procedure/erectile-dysfunction-impotence-male-sexual-dysfunction-1256"">Erectile dysfunction</a>, as you have pointed out, can sometimes be a sign of another underlying medical problem, and a full medical evaluation is definitely in order. 

I think a key question to sort out is whether or not you are still waking up with some erections in the morning. It is unclear from your question if you have lost morning erections entirely or if they have just decreased in frequency. I stress this point because if you still have some morning erections, then this is a positive sign because it indicates that all of the ""machinery"" that leads to erection is still working well in your case. Most young men who don't have any other major medical problems (like, say, diabetes) don't need any detailed medical workup for erectile dysfunction as long as they are having erections occasionally. 

I think it is unlikely that the issue with your foreskin is causes a problem with erectile dysfunction, but your doctor will be able to take a look and figure out whether this might be contributing. Finally, the most likely cause of your erectile dysfunction is <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> or stress, as you also point out, and your doctor will be able to help you figure out if this is the case and, if so, what could be done about it. "
What can cause someone to be a compulsive liar and is there treatment?,"This would be a good issue for your sister to seek treatment for, especially since it seems to be greatly impairing her social interactions and ability to be gainfully employed. You could suggest to her that she see a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> for initial evaluation. The psychiatrist would be able to help determine if the compulsive lying is an isolated problem or if it is also accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms, such as a mood disorder. Based on what the psychiatrist finds, they will be able to make recommendations for treatment. 

Isolated compulsive lying typically doesn't respond very well to medications. However, psychotherapy, or counseling designed to help the individual gain insight into the lying behavior, can be quite helpful. Her psychiatrist could point her in the direction of a good <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> to get this sort of treatment started. 

If there are other associated psychiatric symptoms, her psychiatrist will also be able to help her decide whether any medication therapy would be indicated or helpful. 

Start by encouraging your sister to make an appointment with a medical professional. This will be her first step towards learning to deal with this problem. "
What can cause weak orgasms?,"The sexual response is a very complex physical phenomenon, and it can be affected by many different things. In someone your age, the likelihood that your decreased satisfaction with orgasm is related to a medical problem is fairly low. However, you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a physical examination, because there are several different medical conditions, such as low levels of the sex hormones, that could affect sexual interest and performance. Your doctor will be able to help you decide whether these are likely in your case and if something needs to be done. 

On the other hand, if your physical examination is normal, then you will have to consider other causes. By far, decreased sexual performance is much more often related to either lifestyle factors, such as stress or fatigue, or emotional or psychological issues. It may also be affected by certain substances, especially alcohol which definitely can impair sexual function. Your doctor will be able to help you review all of these possible factors and figure out what areas are likely to be contributing in your case. If necessary, they can also refer you to a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or counselor for additional help.

Does Chagas disease make your heart explode?,"Chagas disease is a chronic medical condition that is caused by infection with a particular form of microscopic parasite, called Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite (and, consequently, Chagas disease) only occurs in parts of the world where the insect that transmits the infection is found. These areas of transmission are limited to South America and a few places in Central America. There is no Chagas disease in the United States, with the exception of a few rare cases caused by blood transfusions (the blood supply in the US is now tested routinely for Chagas disease, so this is also no longer a common mechanism for transmission). Chagas disease can cause many problems, including heart failure, but it does not cause the heart to ""explode.""

More to the point, as someone living in the United States, your risk of getting Chagas disease is essentially nonexistent (unless you travel to some of the remote locations in South America where it can be found). If you are experiencing a recurrent fear about contracting Chagas disease, you should talk with your <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to see if they have any suggestions about how to eliminate the fear.

How much harm can Nicorette patches do to a non-smoking person?,"Nicorette patches contain the drug nicotine, which is also found in tobacco. They are typically used by people who are trying to quit smoking, and they should not be used for any other reason. They are also meant to be applied just one at a time, so applying multiple patches is not safe! 

Using multiple patches at the same time might lead to a nicotine overdose. Nicotine overdose is extremely unpleasant. It causes sweating, palpitations, <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a>, nausea, and <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a>. Sometimes, if the amount of nicotine that is taken in at one time is very high, nicotine overdose can be life threatening. 

I would strongly suggest that you get your friend to seek help from her medical <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Additionally, if you think that this behavior might be part of a pattern of trying to harm herself, then this is a psychiatric emergency, and should be addressed immediately. You could try to connect her with emergency psychiatric resources by contacting your local mental health center or emergency department. Additionally, a list of mental health telephone hotlines can be found on the website of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which can be reached by going to http://www.nami.org."
ADD and OCD! Help!,"I strongly recommend that you discuss this issue with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> at your earliest convenience. 

Attention deficit disorder in adults is a real problem, once that may be under diagnosed. There are somethings that go against <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">ADD</a> in your case, such as the fact that you have always done well in school, and continue to do so now. However, as you say, it may be that the symptoms are getting worse over the intervening years.

It is also possible that some of your symptoms, such as troubling staying focused, are the result of another condition (such as <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>) or the result of fatigue and stress from medical school. 

Your psychiatrist will be able to perform a formal evaluation to see if you meet the criteria for ADD in an adult. If so, there are medications that can be quite helpful at improving attention and focus. At the same time, your psychiatrist will be able to manage your medications for your OCD, to make sure that there are minimal side effects if you do have to end up starting a second medication. 

I suggest that you contact your psychiatrist's office and make an appointment to be seen as soon as you can!"
Why does my husand gets so angry at times?,"Anger and <a href=""/procedure/anger-management-1282"">anger management</a> are very difficult topics to discuss with patients, as they require establishing a full discussion of trust between the health care provider and the patient so that they can work to overcome. More than anything else, the desire of the patient (in this case, your husband), to overcome is anger is going to be important in helping him to move past his issues. If he agrees with you that he has a problem that he needs to work on, then there are many options that can be done to make sure that he eventually overcomes. If, instead, you are the only one who feels that he has a problem, it will be more difficult. It is also important that you feel safe at home. For this reason, it is necessary that you have plans in place and people who you can turn to if he should ever become angry in a manner that is threatening to you or any children or other people that you may be responsible for. This will help you to feel more in charge of the situation and help you in the difficult time you are going through. Please speak to your <a href=""/psychologists"">doctor</a> about your problem, so that he can make the appropriate suggestions after hearing the finer details of your situation. "
Are there ways to deal with depression without medication?,"It is common for people to feel sad or down in the dumps temporarily but if these feelings persist for more than two weeks than it is possible that you are suffering from <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>.  It is very important that you make an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to discuss your symptoms.  Symptoms of depression include feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, guilt, fatigue, changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping, agitation, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide.  There are other medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, that can mimic some of the symptoms of depression so again, it is important to see your doctor.  If it is determined that you are suffering from mild depression or are simply in a low mood there are many things that you can do to alleviate your symptoms that do not include medications.  One of the best mood boosters is exercise.  Getting your heart pumping releases endorphins which have been proven to improve mood.  It is also important to avoid alcohol as it is a depressant.  Talk therapy can be extremely effective.  This is most effective when done with a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or counselor, but talking to supportive family and friends or joining a support group can also be very helpful. Again, please see your doctor soon."
Why can't I have an orgasm?,"I am sorry to hear that your sexual experiences have perhaps not lived up to your expectations. I would strongly suggest that you talk to someone about this issue. A <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or counselor might be a good start, or you may want to talk specifically to a sex <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a>. 

Most of the time, when women fail to have orgasms, this is not  due to a significant medical problem (such as a specific disease), and generally there is nothing wrong with their sexual organs. Of course, there are a few medical diseases that can lead to sexual dysfunction, so it is always important to be in touch with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and to have regular physical examinations at least once a year. 

Most of the time, sexual dysfunction is a problem that can be solved, especially if both partners are willing to explore solutions and new techniques, something that a sex therapist can help you with. Additionally, a sex therapist may want to ask you about whether your trouble having orgasms is just with sexual intercourse or also with masturbation, as that will help define which sorts of strategies will help you. I suggest that you make an appointment at your convenience; if you do not know a good sex therapist, your primary care doctor can suggest one. "
Can a general practitioner diagnose the symptoms of depression?,"Yes, a general practitioner, or a family medical physician can diagnose you with <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> and be able to provide you with appropriate treatment. Depression is a serious medical condition that can have significant effects on an individual's daily functioning status. It is most commonly seen in young patients between 20-40 years of age.
The diagnosis of depression is generally made based on symptoms that the patient's present with and their experiences. This diagnosis does not require any specific testing or labwork, however, labwork maybe ordered in order to rule out medical causes for your depression. Your <a href=""/psychologists"">doctor</a> may even give you a checklist type test to make a diagnosis of depression. Most commonly reported symptoms include hopelessness, poor mood, change in appetite, decreased concentration, symptoms of guilt, decreased interest in activities that were previously enjoyed, changes in sleeping habits, tiredness and thoughts of death. 
Once the diagnosis of depression is made, treatment is generally initiated with antidepressants, and with counseling sessions to discuss your progress. 
You should definitely make an appointment with your primary physician as soon as possible to discuss your concerns. Your doctor will be able to ask questions about your symptoms, and based on the above, and a physical examination, be able to treat you appropriately. "
Can worrying about an illness actually make it worse?,"The relationship between emotional state and physical <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> is very complex. However, certain physical symptoms, such as headache, abdominal pain, indigestion, and dizziness are very strongly influenced by emotional state. So in some ways your friend is right that excessive worrying about a problem can make the problem and the symptoms seem much worse. 

However, it is not always simple to stop worrying about problem. First of all, it is helpful to talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This is because often problems are not as serious as we think they are. For example, indigestion is rarely a major medical problem, and your primary care doctor should be able to help put your mind at rest with some simple education. 

If this does not work, then the next step would be to seek out a few sessions with a counselor or a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a>. Some of us have a harder time dealing with physical stress than others, and it can be very helpful to be able to sit down and talk with someone about this. A counselor will be able to give you some mental strategies for dealing with these negative feelings of worry and stress that you are having a hard time conquering. "
Can chronic pain lead to depression?,"First of all I am sorry to hear that you are having such chronic pain in your leg. If you haven't talked to your doctor about this problem, you definitely should, because it would be good to try to get to the bottom of the cause of the pain. If your doctors have already investigated the pain and haven't been able to uncover a cause, then it might be helpful to talk with a <a href=""/pain-management-specialists"">pain specialist</a> to help you set up a plan for relieving some of the pain. 

There definitely is an association between chronic pain and depression. In part, this is because the chronic pain can serve as a source of stress that can negatively impact your mood. People with chronic pain also tend to be less socially engaged than others (it can be hard to leave the house, for example) and this can also further make them feel alone with their pain. 

If you are feeling this way, then I encourage you to talk to a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> or a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a>. They can assess your mood and help you figure out whether you are depressed, and develop a plan of treatment."
Can your emotional state affect your physical health?,"You mind and your body are intimately connected, and sadness, anxiety, and other emotional states can all have major effects on the body. Typical symptoms that can be brought out by emotional states include headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and trouble with sleep, among many others. 

I am not exactly sure what symptoms you have, as it is not totally clear from your question, but I would highly recommend that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. The first step will be to make sure that whatever you have going on is not another medical condition unrelated to your current emotional state. 

If things check out physically, then your doctor can help connect you with services to deal with the stress of your recent break up. You may benefit from talking to a counselor or <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a>. If you have symptoms of <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> or anxiety, and if those have been going on for a while and causing significant impairment in your daily functioning, those conditions may need to be treated with medications. 

If at any point you feel sad to the point that you begin to feel like you might want to hurt yourself, that is an emergency and you should immediately seek medical help. "
What are the psychological effects of using a wheelchair?,"The benefits of seeing a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> for those who are having difficulty coping with a change in their health or some other traumatic aspect of their lives are numerous. There are many times that it would be appropriate to seek the counsel of a qualified health professional, and if you feel that you are continuing to suffer from the fallout of your accident, then it would be entirely reasonable to meet with a therapist. Many people will find that it there is some element of post-traumatic stress disorder that accompanies any traumatic event. One of the major approaches to treatment is via <a href=""/procedure/psychotherapy-173"">psychotherapy</a>, or discussing your fears with someone. Others will find that there are medications that can help to relieve the tension that continues long after the accident. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, a person that hopefully knows you well and has been with you through the time that you have been recovering from your accident, would be a great source of information on this topic. He or she would be able to listen and make recommendations based on the additional information that you provide, which will allow you to meet with the most appropriate professional. Please speak to your doctor. "
Can a couple attend anger counseling together?,"It sounds like marriage or couples counseling might be an option for you. However, marriage or couples counseling does require that both individuals be interested and committed to attending and to talking with each other and the counselor and working through their issues. Marriage or couples counseling is much less effective when one of the participants is only their because of the other and not because they are also committed to the process. 

If the main issues that you are dealing with is that you frequently fight with each other, than couples counseling might be a good way to address these issues. The problem is probably more broad than simple <a href=""/procedure/anger-management-1282"">anger management</a> and has most likely a lot to do with other expectations and problems in the relationships and difficulties with relating to each other. 

At the same time, individual counseling or therapy is also not a bad idea. Probably the ideal situation is to have time to have both couples counseling as well as individual counseling, which allows you both to benefit both from time alone with a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> as well as time together. 

Talk to your <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or therapist to see what approach they would recommend for your situation. "
Can a divorce drive people toward alcoholism?,"Divorce is a very stressful time for many people, often one of the most stressful they will ever have. Divorce tends to bring up feelings of isolation, loneliness, anger, insecurity and depression. For these reasons, it is not uncommon for some recent divorcees to have some trouble with alcohol. This is because alcohol tends to dampen the acuity of these feelings, at least for a short while. 

The big problem with this, of course, is that drinking alcohol is not doing anything to address the root causes of these feelings. In fact, using alcohol is an avoidance strategy that helps you get away from they hard work of rebuilding your life. In addition to this, alcohol abuse carries significant long term mental and physical health risk that you will want to avoid. 

Therefore, I highly recommend that you set up an appointment with your <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> to talk about these issues and to seek help working through them. Additionally, it might be helpful to talk to your primary care doctor or your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. This is because sometimes an underlying mood problem, such as depression, may occur after divorce and this may need to be treated with medications. 

Good luck!"
Is stress causing my eyes to blink and tic a lot?,"I think the fact that this is a problem that comes only when you are under pressure means that it is most likely just to be a nervous tic. In other words, if your eyes do not do this when you are not under pressure, then it is not likely to be a major medical problem. 

However, nervous tics can be serious social problems, as they can be embarrassing to you and can also have a bad effect on the impression you give while performing under pressure. Many times, nervous tics can be controlled if you learn how. 

You may want to talk to a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> about these tics. Learning to control the tics involves learning to control the <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> and other stress emotions that bring them on. A psychologist or therapist can teach you relaxation techniques as well as cognitive techniques to control anxiety and reduce the chance that the tics will emerge. 

Furthermore, general relaxation and stress reduction techniques may be helpful to you. These can include regular exercise, a regular sleep routine, and healthy eating. Taking control in these areas of your life often will have a major effect on the anxiety that you feel while on the job. "
Will sport counseling help better my performance as a runner?,"Overall the best person with whom to discuss medical questions about your sports performance is your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can put your questions in the context of your general health and, depending on the nature of the practice, can sometimes make any referrals to services such as <a href=""/dietitians"">nutritionists</a> or <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapists</a>, should that be indicated.

When it comes to sports counseling, many serious amateur or professional athletes do use meditation or visualization to help them achieve personal best times or performances.  The only way to know if this will help you is to consider trying it.  Seeking out someone with these kinds of credentials is similar to seeking out someone who performs an alternative medicine therapy like acupuncture....it often works for many people but it is not part of the mainstream practice of medicine so you may have to rely more on word of mouth than on a referral from your physician to a specific office.  

If you are training with a coach, he or she may be able to direct you to some good resources in this arena. Likewise if you aren't training with a coach, finding a respected individual with whom to train may help with both your technique and the mental aspects of performance in athletics."
Is marriage counseling worthwhile soon after getting married?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having some problems in your marriage. There is no exact answer to your question, as each couple is unique and faces their own special set of issues. However, if you are concerned enough about these problems to write the question, then that is probably a sign that you should seek at least some sort of help. 

It is important when deciding to move forward into marriage counseling or couples' therapy that both partners be on board with this move; in order for the counseling to be as effective as possible, there needs to be buy-in and commitment from both parties. Therefore, a good first step would probably be to sit down with your partner and have an honest but gentle conversation about some of your concerns. It is best to make sure to give your partner a lot of space to discuss their own concerns and desires. Then, together, you can decide if this is the right decision for you. 

If so, then there are many options available to you. There are a wide variety of counselors, social workers, <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologists</a>, and <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapists</a> that offer marriage and couples counseling. Talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a recommendation. "
How effective is marriage counseling?,"Thank you for your question.  Unfortunately, there is no ""straight answer"" as to how effective <a href=""/procedure/relationship-marriage-counseling-1274"">marriage counseling</a> is, for a couple of reasons: first, ""success"" has a wide range of meanings, from an amicable divorce to a happy marriage, and second, marriage counseling is confidential, and there is no general central location where data from all marriage counselors are stored.  That said, I have referred many patients to marriage counselors with overall very positive results.

Marriage counseling can be of benefit for a variety of reasons.  First, marriage counselors are trained in the typical problems that married couples experience, from infidelity to financial stress, and have extensive experience about successful coping strategies in each instance.  Marriage counselors are also trained in communication techniques, to help couples communicate their feelings to one another without becoming confrontational.  Furthermore, marriage counselors can serve as a neutral ""third party"" in common arguments, allowing a more rational, calm, and less emotional approach to common disagreements.

Although there is no guarantee of ""success"" by visiting a marriage counselor, were one of my patients to be experiencing marital difficulties, I would certainly refer them for a trial of marriage counseling.  Should you decide to pursue marriage counseling, it is important that you do so knowing that not every counselor is a good fit for every couple; it may take several visits and trials of several different counselors before you find a good fit for you.  Finally, do not forget that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> can act as your advocate if you decide to pursue marriage counseling.  A healthy marriage is an important part of any patient's overall well-being, and if you would like to pursue marriage counseling and you find that your spouse is reluctant, often the advice of your doctor can carry a great deal of weight towards the decision to attend.  You should seek an appointment with your primary care doctor to discuss whether a referral to a marriage counselor is appropriate for you."
Do my partner and I need relationship counseling?,"Long term relationships always take a lot of work.  Ten years is a long time to be together.  It seems to me that though you have not found some way for the two of you to work something out, that there is still a desire to make it work.  If there is a desire to work things out, then you may benefit from couple's counseling.

The purpose of couple's counseling is for each person to voice what they want from the other person with a mediator to communicate and (more importantly) interpret this to each partner.  The sessions often involve one on one sessions with each partner individually and separate sessions with the counselor and the partners together in one room.  Many people have found them helpful, but the success rate is not 100%.

Most couple's counselors are not MDs.  Many of them have PhDs in psychology and have chosen this area of therapy to work in.  Some do not have professional degrees at all and have a certificate in couples counseling.  The key is to find someone that you and your partner both like.  I recommend that you bring the issue up with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. Good luck working things out with your partner."
Should I seek out psychotherapy after the passing of a child?,"Many condolences to you on the loss of your child.  This is one of the most difficult losses for a parent or a family to face, and the depression that you are all experiencing is very normal.  That being said, grief and the depression that can be associated with it are also something that can be very debilitating to your life (and that of the other members of your family).  You should bring up these issues with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and also the <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> for other children you may have.  Children and adults process loss differently, and even if they don't express themselves in the same way, it is also important for children to have an outlet for their grief.  

A wide range of options is available to help support a family through the grieving process.  Psychotherapy can be very helpful and can sometimes be done both individually and with an entire family who may have jointly suffered a loss.  In some people the normal grieving after a death does extend into clinical depression that can and should be treated with the care of a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> (can involve medications and/or therapy).  Furthermore, there are also support groups for families who have suffered a loss and this 'non-medical' option may also be very helpful for you and your family.  Your primary care physician should be able to help connect you with these resources."
Is a neuropathology consultation meant for someone with nerve problems?,"I would recommend that you see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. He or she can help with anxiety or ""nerves."" A <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> is often more helpful with there are problems with the nerves themselves -- for example when one has decreased feeling in their hands or feet or burning pain. Your primary care doctor can help understand and diagnose the symptoms as well as likely treat them. If required, he or she could then subsequently refer you to the appropriate specialist.

Feeling jittery or having nerves or anxiety can occur for many different reasons. There are some hormonal causes of this that should be ruled out. Most commonly, high thyroid levels, or hyperthyroidism, should be investigated. This can be done by a simple blood test. High levels of the thyroid hormone (or the ""energy"" hormone) can cause jitteriness. In addition, another common cause of this sensation is medication or other substances. Caffeine, supplements, medication or illicit drugs like cocaine or ""crystal meth"" can cause this. Your doctor can help diagnose one of these or other causes.

If there is no obvious cause, you may have ""generalized anxiety disorder. This can be diagnosed and also treated. If needed, a <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> can also help.

Again, please talk to your primary doctor."
Can traveling get rid of the winter blues?,"""Seasonal affective disorder"" is the medical term for what you are discussing.  While it is not usually a severe form of <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> that needs treatment, people who live in colder, darker climates frequently report feeling more ""blue"" during the dark, cold winter months.  Some <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrists</a> feel that this is due to the fact that cold regions are dark around the time when most adults are waking up to go to work, and that this causes problems with patients' Circadian rhythms (the body's sleep-wake, light-dark cycle), causing people to feel down.  Another hypothesis is that since it gets darker earlier in the evenings, people are less likely to spend time outdoors doing activities that are usual stress-relievers like exercise, walking pets, etc.

If you can afford it and get time away from work, traveling to a warmer, brighter climate may be helpful.  You may find, however, that your symptoms return when you come back.  There are some other therapies for seasonal affective disorder, like ""light box"" therapies that expose you to large amounts of artificial light (in your own house) upon waking up to ""reset"" your circadian rhythm.

You should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or a psychologist/psychiatrist to further discuss and to make sure you do not have a more severe form of depression."
Do vitamin supplements help athletes perform better?,"There has been quite a bit of research that has gone into optimizing performance, and one of the simplest and best studied methods to do this has been through the use of multi-vitamins. For the most part, this research has demonstrated that for normal people who are otherwise healthy and eat a well balanced diet, there is not much benefit to the use of regular vitamins and mineral supplementation. Depending on your level of physical activity and other medical conditions, there can obviously be some variation to this, but for most athletes a healthy diet including lots and lots of fruits and vegetables will contain what your body needs to perform optimally. 

Despite this, it is obvious that there is a large market to athletes and others who want a ""quick fix"" or ""extra boost,"" and the proliferation of performance enhancing drugs and even just so-called health stores is proof that many people continue to turn to other methods. The vitamins and minerals that we need are necessary for the body to perform well, but more than enough has not been found to be beneficial. Please speak with your <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> for more information about optimizing your performance. "
How does testosterone help in muscle development?,"Testosterone is one of the important parts of adding muscle bulk to any body, and is a big part of the reason that males are naturally more muscular than females, in general. The obvious caveat is that there are many other effects of testosterone other than just helping to <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> muscle mass, which can be seen in everything from the hair and balding patterns of men, all the way to the increased rates of heart disease at a young age, among other effects. 

Testosterone is a steroid, and, as such, it carries messages to the DNA of the cells in your body. These messages are interpreted and then cause the various cells to create new proteins and follow a different plan based on the level or presence of these hormones. In the case of testosterone, part of the message that the hormone carries is to increase muscle bulk. For that reason, women, who do not have the same levels of testosterone, are not able to naturally add the same amount of muscle mass that men do, in general. If you are seeking to bulk up, there are many methods to do so, however. Please speak to a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> about healthy ways to do so. "
Is it dangerous to dip below my normal weight?,"Maintaining a healthy body weight is an important part of ensuring long-term health and well-being.  You should discuss any concerns you have about your weight and eating patterns with your primary care <a href=""/psychologists"">doctor</a>.  He or she can talk with you about your overall health and could even refer you to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietician</a> or nutritionist if this would be helpful.

It is very natural for you to eat less when you get stressed.  Many people find that stress causes them to change their eating habits: some people eat more while others such as yourself eat less.  If you eat less food than usual for long enough, you will lose weight.  The health risks of weight fluctuations depend on what your 'normal' body weight is; how much weight you are losing; and whether or not you are gaining it back.  The best way to identify a healthy weight range for yourself is to calculate your BMI (there are online calculators that can do this for you).  A healthy BMI - i.e. a healthy weight range for your height--is between 19 and 25.  As you can see, this means there is wide range of weights that could be okay for you, given your height.  

However, if you are routinely losing weight because of disordered eating, you should talk about this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to try and develop more optimal coping strategies to prevent problems in the future."
Are there dating groups for people with GAD?,"I suggest that you talk about these concerns with your <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a>. I say this because the best way to meet people and to successfully form relationships is to work on overcoming the anxiety that makes forming the relationships possible. It sounds like your anxiety symptoms are not very well controlled, and you may need to work on that with your therapist and also, potentially, with your <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> if you are taking medications. 

Also, from your second comment it sounds like you might be dealing with some self esteem issues that might or might not be related to the anxiety. This is also something you can bring up in your therapy sessions for working through and resolving. 

Finally, it is often helpful for people with anxiety symptoms to make connections to others in low risk settings that do not trigger anxiety. This might, for example, mean exploring relationships that are introduced by family or friends. It also might mean working on meeting people through groups that are focused on other things, such as church groups or volunteer organizations. These setting, because they have another focus, can often alleviate the stress of a social setting that is more explicitly focused on dating. "
What is causing my teenager's despondency?,"Adolescence is a time of great change as teenagers are starting to develop the skills of making their own choices and managing their own lives in preparation for adulthood--even though they aren't quite there yet.  During this time of developing physical, emotional, and often sexual independence, there can be a great many stressors that can be very difficult for some teenagers to handle.  As you have noticed, some teens may not want to talk about these challenges with their parents, even when something does seem to be bothering them.  

It is great that you have a close enough relationship with your son that you are noticing something seems to be going on.  It sounds like he may be hesitant to talk with you about things that may be bothering him, but that doesn't mean you should stop letting him know that you are there for him should be want to reach out.  It is also a good idea to make sure that he has regular annual visits with his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, as he may be more comfortable bringing up particular issues in private and a physician who knows him well may be able to screen for <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>.  There are definitely <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapists</a> who do specialize in working with adolescents, but without knowing exactly what is going on with your son, it is hard to know whether this would be appropriate.  As a concerned parent, in addition to speaking with your son himself, you can also talk with his teachers at school or other adults he may interact with (parents of friends, coaches, etc) to see if they have noticed a change."
Are there any long term effects associated with the date rape drug?,"The ""date rape drug"" may refer to a variety of drugs, but it most commonly refers to Flunitrazepam (also known as Rohypnol), popularly referred to as ""roofies.""  Rohypnol is a drug in the class of medicines known as benzodiazepines, which are sedative medications often used in the treatment of insomnia or <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> disorders.  In high doses, Flunitrazepam produces what is known as ""anterograde amnesia"" or an inability to form new memories, as well as profound sedation often resulting in a loss of consciousness.  The immediate effects of flunitrazepam can include dangerous respiratory <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> (loss of the impulse to breath) when combined with other drugs such as alcohol.  However it does not typically have lasting side effects or result in brain damage.

That said, Rohypnol, while one of the very common drugs used as a ""date rape drug"" is only one of many different drugs used for that purpose.  While these drugs are often detectable in the hours to days after administration, it is not likely to be possible to determine which drug you were administered years ago.  If you have specific concerns about your memory, cognitive ability, or ability to move, you should seek an in-person consultation with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.  And certainly, if you ever suspect in the future that you have been unwillingly given a ""date rape drug,"" seek the help of a doctor right away.  It may be possible to determine exactly what drug has been administered and, in the right setting, this may help bring the individuals responsible to justice."
Does the date rape drug really make a person pass out?,"The ""date rape drug"" most commonly refers to a medication called flunitrazepam, more commonly known as rohipnol.  The medication is called the ""date rape drug"" because of its ability to create ""anterograde amnesia"" - in other words, it blocks your mind's ability to form new memories.  

Rohypnol is a odorless, tasteless compound that can be mixed into food or drinks without the knowledge of the person who takes it.  The early effects are similar to drinking alcohol, with confusion, slurred speech, and difficulty walking.  With a sufficient dose, these do typically progress to passing out.  Although you may pass out after being given rohypnol, the drugs memory-blocking effects kick in well in advance of passing out.  This means that you may not remember acting strangely before passing out, or even be aware that you are acting strangely in the first place.

The best strategy for avoiding rohypnol is to avoid situations in which you are alone, since once you have been given the drug, your ability to protect yourself is limited.  If you go out, go out in a group, and be sure that at least one, and preferably more than one person is sober and responsible for the rest of the group, and do not become separated from one another.  And if anyone begins to act strangely, especially if they seem like they ""had too much to drink"" but clearly did not, take that person with you and leave in a group immediately."
How can I make a burn victim less self conscious about his appearance?,"The fact that you are asking this question tells me that you are already very empathetic, and putting yourself in this person's shoes.  People who suffer serious disfiguring <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> can have a variety of long-term psychological damage as a result, in addition to the physical damage.  They can have insecurity around their appearance which can be very profound.  They can have post-traumatic stress symptoms which cause them to relive the moment of their injury and can be incredibly anxiety-provoking.  Finally, they can have feelings of guilt related to the circumstances of the accident, particularly around injuries to other people.

When approaching this person about their injuries, it will be useful to be mindful of these issues, and to be respectful of the fact that they may not want to discuss the circumstances of the injury or the injury at all.  Since you want to reassure this person that you are interested in who he is, demonstrate that by showing a steadfast interest in him as a person.  Part of who he is is the experience he went through that led to his injury, and he will most likely suggest to you when the appropriate time to discuss the injury is by bringing up the topic.  If you decide to bring it up yourself, allow enough time for trust to develop between you, and be open to the possibility that he may not be ready to discuss it for all of the reasons listed above.  If he chooses not to, be respectful of his choice and wait for another time - this is not reflective of you or of your relationship, but rather of the totally normal feelings that he may have related to this accident.

These suggestions are not tailored to your individual circumstances, but hopefully they will give you a place to start.  If at some point it becomes appropriate and seems necessary, a trained <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> may be able to help the two of you work through these issues in an open and individualized manner."
Is there a limit to the number of divorce counseling sessions I can have?,"All of these questions are things that you should discuss with your counselor, <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, and other confidants who know you well enough to understand the process that you are going through, as there is no perfect number of sessions for every person. The limiting number will have to do more with what you prefer and can afford than any other variables, although your counselor may recommend a certain number of visits depending on what he or she feels your needs are after an initial visit. 

During this time, it is important to have people around you that can validate your feelings and value as a person. After spending time with someone on such an intimate level as marriage, it can be very difficult to realize that that sense of identity and validation are going to be absent going forwards. Caring friends, ears, and voices on all sides will help you to cope as you move forward. Physical activity and exercise have been found on numerous moods to improve your sense of psychological well being and reduce stress, and they are obviously good for you in other ways as well. Please speak with your primary care doctor who can assess you for the possible need for the help of a <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a>. "
Do couples who undergo behavior therapy stay together?,"I am so sorry to hear that you and your husband are undergoing marital stress at this point in your marriage, and applaud your desire to seek professional help in working through your difficulties. Many couples find that meeting with a <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> or counselor as a couple is invaluable in expressing difficulties and finding the appropriate solutions. Furthermore, these sessions will also give couples the skills that they need to work through difficulties in a reasonable and respectful manner in the future, making them more likely to resolve conflicts on their own going forward. 

As always, the key in any relationship is mutual respect and a mutual desire to ""set things right."" If both parties are in agreement that the marriage is worth preserving, counseling can be a very worthwhile piece of the puzzle in making marriage work. While you are going through this stressful time, please remember to take care of your mental and physical health as needed, and especially make sure that you are safe at all times. Your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or OB/GYN will have specific information about your situation, and can refer you to the appropriate resources as needed. A <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologist</a> or professional therapist will likely be your final counselor. "
Are there anti-anxiety breathing exercises I can use during public speaking events?,"Glossophobia is the fear of public speaking, and it is incredibly common. Like most things, it will improve with time and the realization that you can do it, and you can do it well. Until you get to that point, however, there are many things that can be done. 

Some people like to do conditioning exercises, where they imagine the worst thing that can happen, and then realize how unlikely that is to happen, and that, even if it did happen, they would be able to cope with it and move on. They then imagine the event in a more realistic light, and it helps them to understand that they have the ability to overcome catastrophic events, and so the normal outcome will be perfect. For others, slow, deep breathing and mental exercises can help them to calm their nerves. 

There are also groups, such as Toastmasters, that meet together to help improve public speaking skills and work through the <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>. If all of these are still not enough, there are also medications that can be helpful. Please speak to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as needed, but realize that most people have some fear of public speaking, and you can likely overcome it. "
Why do I keep crying even when nothing is wrong?!,"I am sorry to hear that you have been having these uncontrollable crying spells. From your description, it is unclear if you have any underlying depressive thoughts, suicidal ideations, thoughts of hurting yourself or others, but if you notice any of these symptoms you should immediately go to your nearest emergency department for further evaluation because <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a> can be   a very serious disease and if these crying episodes are related to depression, then there is concern that this may worsen. 

It is recommended that you consult a mental health care professional as soon as possible because of these symptoms that you are having. Based upon your clinical exam, they may decide to start you on certain medications to adjust your mood. You do not need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about what you will say to a counselor when you see them, because they are trained to care for patients who have symptoms such as the ones you are experiencing. 

The most important thing to do at this time is to be evaluated so that further work up can be done and the appropriate treatment regimen can begin. They will also examine other facets of your life to see if there are underlying causes for your stress such as family history, high stress jobs, etc."
How do I prepare for speaking to a psychologist about why I think I may be depressed?,"First, I am sorry to hear that you are having difficulty with <a href=""/procedure/depression-493"">depression</a>. Speaking with a professional is a definite step in the right direction, as qualified council and, potentially, medical aid can help significantly. It is important to understand the difference between <a href=""/psychologists"">psychologists</a> and <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrists</a>. Psychologists are extremely helpful in understanding and potentially diagnosing concerns and issues that patients might have. They are somewhat limited, however, on the scope of medications and other aid that they can provide, as they do not have a medical degree. Psychiatrists, on the other hand, are able to write prescriptions that cover a broader scope of ailments. The difference could be significant with regards to the approach to your specific problems.
As for how to prepare: one of the best things about visiting a mental health professional is that very little preparation is needed. What is important, however, is the need to be honest and open with your provider so that together you can understand and agree on a future course of action that will result in the best outcome. You should plan on discussing any previous medical or psychiatric illnesses you have had in the past, and how those were addressed as well. Good luck, and know that there are excellent treatment options that can help improve your quality of life."
Why do I get nauseous from stress?,"The effects of stress on the body can be useful in certain situations, think of the fight or fight response, but they can also cause adverse effects on our bodies, especially when stress continues for long periods of time. People have many different ways that they experience stressful situations, including changes in their bowels, fatigue, sweating, headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, and <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>. Tums may not be addressing the underlying problem, which is likely related to the stress factors that you are experiencing. 

It is recommended that you are evaluated by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> who will best be able to evaluate your medical history and presenting symptoms and decide upon the appropriate work up. This may include referral to a specialist. There are various ways to decrease your bodies response to stress. These include breathing exercises, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and aerobic workouts. There are also medications to help control stress, which you can discuss with your primary care doctor. These medications have side effects which you may or may not tolerate. For this reason, it is recommended that you discuss all options available for stress relief with you primary care doctor."
Why do I have to worry about withdrawal from methadone?,"Opiates are powerful medications with strong mental and physical effects, making them potentially addictive substances. They act on pain receptors in the central nervous system. Opiates such as heroin and morphine work in the same fashion as methadone, which is a substance commonly used in the treatment of patients previously addicted to opiates. As the body is exposed to pain medications of this type, it becomes ""used to"" the effects of the opiates. When the opiates are taken away, the body withdraws, as it is no longer getting its usual stimulus. 

Stopping methadone abruptly can produce the same effects as stopping heroin abruptly. A withdrawal syndrome involving nausea, abdominal pain, <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, sweating, chills, runny nose, <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a>, and elevated heart rate among other symptoms can result. For this reason, if a patient and his/her <a href=""/psychologists"">doctor</a> decide to end methadone treatment, the medication should be tapered off over a long period of time."
What causes compulsive lying in adults?,"It is difficult to answer your question definitively, as people may lie for various reasons. 

Most people lie to achieve some goal, either directly for their own gain, or to avoid social embarrassment (a ""white"" lie). Sometimes, people have lies that make a lot of sense to them, as they help them to achieve a goal, but these goals may not be apparent to people in their lives. 

Truly pathological lying requires that the lying be completely out of proportion to any perceived goal. Therefore before calling the lying behavior compulsory in that way, it is important to think if their might be any reasons for it. People often lie out of shame (for not meeting the expectations of those around them), or to conceal an <a href=""/procedure/addiction-substance-abuse-177"">addiction</a> (drugs, compulsive spending creating debt problems, etc.)

Occasionally, compulsive or habitual lying can be a symptom of a larger psychiatric disorder, such as attention deficit disorder. In attention deficit disorder, people may lack the executive function to censor their thoughts and end up saying things they would not normally say if they had thought more carefully about the issue. 

The best thing that you can do is to continue to be supportive of your brother as you are able, and to broach with him the possibility that he might want to seek some professional help for dealing with this problem. "
Pain after knee replacement?,"Joint replacement surgery can be very painful and the best thing to do is to be evaluated by your orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>.  In addition to the resolving healing process of having part of your knee joint replaced by the artificial joint, you also have to recover and rehabilitate the muscles, tendons, and ligaments in your leg after undergoing surgery.  The symptoms you are describing sound like they could be related either to the actual parts of the knee replacement itself or to some <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a> or imbalance that developed following the procedure.  If you have a problem with the actual prosthesis it is important that your surgeon be aware of this issue so that he or she can take any appropriate surgical care that might be needed.  If you have a soft tissue issue such as muscle strain or sprain, then a course of physical therapy might be the best way to resolve your pain and help your regain your mobility.  To determine which of these two scenarios is responsible for your symptoms, the best thing for you to do is to see your orthopedic surgeon for an evaluation.  He or she will want to examine your knee and likely get X-rays to make sure that the joint prosthesis is still seated properly.  If the prosthesis is okay, then you might be best served by a referral to a physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a>."
Why are my shoulder issues cropping up again?,"Shoulder pain can be very frustrating and have a significant impact on your daily life and activities.  Although it is impossible to say for sure without examining your shoulder and obtaining more of a history, the details you relate about pain, weakness, and difficulty with specific activities does sound very much like a rotator cuff tear or other pathology.  The only way to know for sure is by undergoing the imaging study (likely an MRI with arthrogram) that was recommended earlier.  Physical therapy can help with some shoulder problems, but if you have a full rotator cuff tear or problem with another of the structural components of the shoulder, such as the labrum, then <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> may be the only way to definitively treat your problem (with a lot of physical therapy following surgery).  Determining whether someone is a candidate for rotator cuff surgery requires imaging and evaluation by a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> to go over your prior health history.  Depending upon your age, you also may or may not be a candidate for surgery, as physical therapy alone is generally recommended for older patients.

In this situation, the best thing for you to do is go back to the primary physician who initially suggested imaging and discuss completing that imaging with potential referral to an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> for evaluation."
What causes fluid in the elbow?,"From the description of your symptoms it sounds like you may have a joint effusion, which is exactly as you describe: fluid that goes to the joint.  The question in this kind of situation is what is causing the effusion.  In order to figure this out, the best thing for you to do will be to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> right away for an evaluation.  He or she will of course want to evaluate your elbow and possibly drain off some of the fluid to look at under a microscope and send off for further testing.  This may also help you feel better without all of the swelling that makes it hard to use your arm.  However, since there are many things that can cause joint effusions, your <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> will also want to ask you a lot of questions.  It will be important to know if there has been any trauma to the area; if you have noticed any pain in the elbow or other joints; whether you have been having any fevers, chills, night sweats, or <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>; any rashes or changes in your skin; or any new activities.  Examining the joint will also give your doctor a sense of whether or not there is concern for infection which can be quite serious in a joint. Again, please discuss this issue with your doctor."
What is the prognosis for degenerative scoliosis?,"Degenerative scoliosis is a condition in which the spine starts to deteriorate and bend. It is most common in older adults, and especially women. It is though that a combination of genetic factors and regular aging contribute to degenerative scoliosis. Also, especially in women, osteoporosis (low bone density) plays a big role, in part by predisposing to the development of fractures in the spinal vertebrae which can accelerate the changes. 

If you've been diagnosed with degenerative scoliosis, then it will be important to have good follow-up with your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor and also your orthopedic doctor. For your doctors, probably the first priority will be treating any osteoporosis if you have it, typically with calcium supplements and other medications. Additionally, physical therapy and other forms of exercise or probably indicated. 

By far the most common symptom of early degenerative scoliosis is pain in the back. If this does not respond to exercise and physical therapy, then your doctors may also want to add medications specifically for treating the pain. Occasionally, in more severe cases of degenerative scoliosis, braces or <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> may be indicated, but your doctors will be able to follow you closely and let you know if you are getting to that stage."
Can mild scoliosis be treated?,"<a href=""/procedure/scoliosis-spine-deformation-1214"">Scoliosis</a> is defined as an abnormal curvature of the spine, and it’s something you can discuss with an orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>.  Mild scoliosis is that which is not severe, where the angle of the curvature is small.  Most of the time scoliosis causes no symptoms, or symptoms of mild back pain.  The back pain is often due to strain placed on the muscles of the back.  Occasionally, scoliosis can cause spinal instability which can require <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> if symptoms are severe enough.  Sometimes scoliosis can cause the mechanics of breathing more difficult.  As people age, sometimes they can experience shortness of breath because of chest wall restriction.  

Keep in mind that most of the problems outlined above are most common in people that have severe scoliosis.  The typical person with mild scoliosis lives a completely normal life, usually completely symptom free.  The most common symptom of someone with mild curvature would be intermittent back pain later in life.  Most people do not need invasive procedures such as back surgery.  Many people with scoliosis-induced back pain can control it well with physical therapy.  

The physician that your sister's son should see about this problem is an orthopedic surgeon.  He or she can explain the severity of the situation and give your sister a sense of what complications (if any) he is likely to have later in life. "
What should I do if my sprained ankle seems to be taking ages to heal?,"Sprained ankles can be a very frustrating <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> because they can indeed take a long time to recover.  In order to determine whether or not there is a problem with your recovery, it will be important to consider a few important details.  First, when you initially injured the ankle, were you evaluated by a physician?  A sprained ankle may seem like a trivial injury and many people will not seek immediate medical attention, but if this was a self-diagnosed injury and it has been several weeks without improvement, it is possible that you may have sustained more significant damage such as a torn ligament or tendon which may not heal without surgical intervention.

Second, how long is a long time to heal?  A few days can seem like a long time to a young and active person, and unfortunately joint injuries will often take weeks to return to normal function.

On the other hand, if it has been weeks and you are still unable to use the leg normally and experiencing significant pain, this may well be a sign that something else is going on.

The best thing to do in this situation is to either go back to the physician who first evaluated the injury or to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> about an evaluation and potential referral to an orthopedic specialist. Book an appointment today!  Hopefully you'll get some answers soon!"
What is 'hemihypertrophy'?,"Hemihypertrophy, or hemihyperplasia as it is more correctly called, is a rare condition that affects slightly more than 1:100,000 new births. It is often associated with other syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedeman Syndrome, and has varying degrees of severity. It is important to work with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and the specialists that he or she may recommend to both monitor the condition and to make sure that there are no other subsequent medical issues (such as tumors) that may arise. In many cases, due to the rarity of the condition, it may be appropriate to seek a <a href=""/procedure/second-opinion-368"">second opinion</a> at a tertiary (referral) medical center rather than just the community, and speak with a <a href=""/geneticists"">geneticist</a>. 

As for possible treatments for the condition, this is impossible to say without more information. Some presentations of the condition are mild and affect only a single part of the body. These can be managed by correcting any symptoms that may arise. Other people with the condition have more involvement of larger or more vital structures that may affect their life more intimately. As far as treatments to eliminate the condition completely, there are none, and symptoms are most often managed as they arise. Please book an appointment with your doctor immediately!"
Did I sprain my arm?,"There are not many details in your question about where exactly your arm hurts, so it is hard to give you specific information. I would recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, especially if the pain continues to be an issue. They will be able to examine your arm and help figure out whether you need x-rays (to rule out a broken arm) or any specific treatment. 

Injuries to the arm are pretty common, especially when one falls onto the outstretch warm, as it sounds like you may have. By far the most common form of <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> is a sprain, which causes pain, swelling, and stiffness around one or more joints (such as the wrist, shoulder, or elbow). Depending on the severity of the sprain, it may be treated with rest, ice, and anti inflammatory medications or, in the most severe cases, it may require referral to an orthopedic specialist for additional treatment. 

It is also important to make sure you haven't broken any bones. Your doctor will be able to examine the arm and, if there are any areas of focal pain or deformities, they will want to get x-rays to rule out a break. 

Speak with your doctor right away!"
"Why does my right knee hurt when I sit or drive, but not when I stand or walk?","I'd recommend making an appointment to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. Knee pain is a very common health issue, and there are many different potential causes. Your doctor will be able to examine the knee, ask about your symptoms, and help you decide what workup you need to arrive at a diagnosis. 

One common cause of knee pain is something called patellofemoral pain syndrome. This is an overuse injury to the knee that causes cartilage deterioration under the knee cap. I mention it because one of the common symptoms is pain that is worse with sitting but better with standing. 

Another common problem in someone your age would be the start of osteoarthritis, or ""wear and tear"" arthritis, which often affects the big joints such as the knees or hips later in life. 

Many <a href=""/procedure/knee-problems-124"">knee problems</a> can be treated with simple measures, such as exercises or physical therapy together with pain medications as recommended by your doctor. However, some more severe or advanced knee problems might require referral to a specialist, such as an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a>. However, your primary care doctor will be able to help you figure out if a referral is necessary or not."
What causes a constant sharp pain like a knitting needle pushed into the MCL area of my left knee?,"This pain you are having seems quite severe, and it is clearly limiting your activity if it comes on with as little as 30 feet of walking. For this reason, you should see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for an evaluation. There are many different causes of knee pain, but your doctor will be able to help point you in the right direction. 

For example, if you are physically active with a lot of higher impact sports, such as running, then an overuse injury, such as runner's knee, will be high on the list. 

Similarly, if you have a history of a severe knee injury in the past, then a torn ligament or damaged cartilage will be higher on the list. 

Finally, if you are middle aged or older (it is not clear from your question what your age is), then wear and tear <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> might be more likely. 

Your doctor will perform a careful examination of your knee. Based on what they find, together with what they discover in your history, they may want additional testing, such as x-rays or an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of the knee. They  will also be able to recommend the appropriate next steps either in treatment or in referral to a specialist. Make an appointment with your primary care doctor today."
"Kicked in pointer and middle fingers, hurts to move. What's wrong?","I'm sorry to hear about your injury! You should definitely get this checked out by a <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a>. Injuries to the hand like this can range from simple sprains that do not require any specific medical intervention to tendon ruptures and fractures of the small bones of the hand. 

One critical question that needs to be answered is whether this is a true emergency (requiring a visit to the emergency room) or something that you can wait and see your doctor about in the office. If you have any loss of feeling in the hand or if you notice any deformity of the fingers (such as one of the knuckles displaced), then you should definitely err on the side of going to the emergency room, where the <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctors</a> will be able immediately to perform x-rays and determine if you need to see an orthopedic doctor. If not, then calling your primary care doctor's office and getting in to an urgent care visit as quickly as possible is probably sufficient. 

In addition to ruling out a broken bone or ruptured tendon, your doctor will be able to recommend additional treatment, which might include splinting the involved fingers or taking anti-inflammatory medications. Go see a doctor as soon as possible."
My knee has started to hurt. Is it sprained?,"You should definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this as soon as you can. Any <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the knee that results in significant pain and trouble walking or bending the knee needs to be investigated. 

A sprain is the most likely possibility. A sprain occurs when the ligaments that protect and stabilize the knee joint are stretched too much. The symptoms include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the joint. However, there are also other possibilities, including damage to the knee meniscus or even a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> of a bone. Your doctor will be able to perform an examination of the knee and determine whether you need any specific workup, such as x-rays of the knee. 

Then, after this, they will be able to give you advice on what to do to help the knee return to normal. This might just involve physical rest, ice, elevation, and anti-inflammatory medications. Sometimes, however, other therapies might be needed, such as a knee immobilizer. If there is a severe sprain or a fracture, your doctor will want you to be evaluated by an orthopedic specialist for further treatment and follow up. 

Make an appointment with your doctor today. I hope that you are feeling better soon!"
"What is a small, hard, painless bump below the knee?","I suggest mentioning this issue to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> the next time you see them, as there are several potential causes of this bump. Your doctor will be able to examine your knee closely and help you decide if further work up is needed. 

First, this could be a sign of <a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> in the knee. ""Wear and tear"" arthritis --also known as osteoarthritis -- begins to be a quite common problem in middle aged and older adults, and it may in part manifest as stiffness in the joint together with small bumps or deformities, which represent to the gradual damage over time to the joint. 

Second, this could be a cyst associated with the tendons or bursa (fluid-filled shock absorbing structures) around the knee. These may occur again as a result of wear and tear or they may occur spontaneously. 

Finally, this could be a cyst in the deeper layers of the skin that is not in any way related to the knee joint. Cysts commonly occur under the skin basically anywhere on the body, and this could be the case for you. 

Your doctor can determine whether this bump needs to be biopsied or surgically removed, or whether it is ok simply to observe it for now. Please book an appointment soon."
Did my discectomy fail?,"It sounds like you had a pretty extensive back <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, so congratulations on making it through the procedure uneventfully!

Most of the time, procedures like this are done where there is severe back pain that doesn't respond to less aggressive treatments, like pain medications and physical therapy. Therefore, by the time that surgery is resorted to, there can be fairly significant, long standing inflammation and compression of nerve roots coming off of the spinal column. Although back surgeries, such as the one you just had, are designed to relieve this compression, the swelling and damage to the nerve root can persist for quite a while. Gradually, however, if the surgery was successful, this swelling should go down and there should be an improvement in the pain and other symptoms. 

I suggest that you talk with the orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> who performed the surgery. They know your case best, and will be able to give you a better sense of what your post operative course should be like, including when you might start to expect to experience some improvement in your symptoms. They will also be able to help you with any component of the pain that might be from the surgery itself."
I have a sclerotic lesion on my spine. What does this mean ?,"I am sorry to hear that you are having so much pain in your back. You will definitely need to work with your orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> and the other <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctors</a> caring for you, both to help find some relief for the pain and also to help figure out what this lesion on her vertebra means. 

Sclerotic lesion is a generic term that refers to an area of bone that appears 'scarred.' There are many different causes of isolated sclerotic lesions of the bones. These causes include an infection in the bone (osteomyelitis), scarring from prior trauma (such as a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> or orthopedic surgery), and various types of cancer (which can either originate in the bone or metastasize from somewhere else, such as the breast or the prostate). 

Your doctor, who knows your case best, will be able to provide advice to you on how you should proceed. If the pain pump runs into this area of your spine, or if you have had surgery here, then it is possible that this is the cause of the sclerotic lesion. On the other hand, it may be necessary to do additional testing to rule out some of the other causes of a sclerotic lesion. "
What does my MRI report mean?,"You should discuss this question with the physician who ordered the test. If your <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> has ordered an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of your lower back, you must have been suffering from some significant back pain.  One of the most common causes of lower back pain is the kind of herniated disc described in your MRI.  In very basic terms, the intervertebral discs are a connective tissue support for the column of vertebrae.  Over time, these discs can herniate out from between the vertebrae causing problems with vertebral alignment and nerve impingement.  Nerve roots project from the right and left of the spinal cord, and their exit from the spinal cord itself must traverse the vertebrae.  When intervertebral discs herniate, they can exert pressure on these spinal nerves, causing significant pain and immobility.  Your MRI report tells you that the disc between your 5th lumbar vertebrae and 1st sacral vertebrae is impinging on the nerve root that leaves the spinal cord at the level of the 1st sacral vertebrae.

However, whether or not this will need to translate into surgery depends upon your clinical exam and discussion with your physician.  In many cases, conservative treatment (such as rest, physical therapy, and medication) has much better outcomes for lower back pain than does invasive surgery.  Now that you've had this imaging study, the best thing for you to do is to return to the physician who ordered the test to go over the results and discuss whether you are a candidate for surgery or whether or not conservative treatment would be more appropriate.  Your physician may also want to refer you to a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who specializes in back surgery. Please discuss with your doctor soon."
What is wrong with my lower back?,"You should see a <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> for a comprehensive physical examination. I would recommend not waiting until you enlist to get this done, because if you are suffering from severe and constant back pain for unknown reasons, this will almost certainly get worse when you have to go through basic training. Worse yet, you could potentially do serious harm to yourself if you are too physically active with all of this pain. 

A good idea would be to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> (or a back specialist, if you have access to one) prior to enlistment. They will be able to perform a thorough examination and help you figure out what might be going on. 

In addition to a problem in your back itself (such as a pinched nerve or slipped disc), it is also possible that your back pain is related to your other problems (flat feet, chondromalacia). This is because, sometimes, problems in the feet or legs can lead to gait or posture abnormalities that can put excess strain on the back muscles, leading to spasm or pain. Therefore, your doctor will want to consider all of these symptoms you have to help figure out what to do next. "
What does my MRI report mean? ,"Most likely you had this <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of your spine done in order to investigate why you might be having back pain or related symptoms. Essentially what this report says is that one of the discs that pads the spaces between the vertebra in the spinal column has herniated out if the space between the discs and is potentially pressing into the area of one of the nerve roots. 

This finding on the MRI could be the cause of the symptoms you are having, but this definitely requires review by your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor, spine doctor, or whichever doctor ordered this test. This is because findings on a spine MRI need to be carefully correlated with the exact symptoms you are experiencing in order to determine whether the two are related. 

Also, your doctor will be able to help you figure out what to do next. This will depend a lot on the severity of your symptoms and how recently they have started. Some disc herniations will spontaneously improve, and only require anti inflammatory medications and physical therapy. Other disc herniations are very severe and require back surgery. The doctors who know your case the best will be able to give you appropriate advice!"
Will a partially torn UCL of thumb heal?,"It sounds like the injury responsible for your ligament tear may also have caused some nerve damage.  In many cases damage to nerves is not permanent, as some types of nerve injury can be repaired.  However, damaged nerves typically regenerate very, very slowly which is why you are still experiencing some deficits in sensation well after the initial injury.  However, it is important for your treating orthopedic physician to know about these symptoms, because the management of injuries in the hand can often depend upon the degree of functional deficit.  Even if your orthopedist would not recommend <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> for your injury, he or she may well want to make changes in recommendations based upon possible nerve damage.  Some types of occupational therapy may also be helpful, when it safe to remove the splint, to ensure that you are still able to use the hand and thumb despite any changes in your sensation or strength.  Overall the best thing to do is discuss your symptoms and prognosis with your orthopedist at your next appointment.  Although it is impossible to predict outcomes with 100% certainty, in the context of your overall injury and progress so far, your physician should be able to give you an idea of what to expect in future.  And, depending upon the results of your exam, he or she may want to also have you evaluated by a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>. Again, please discuss with your <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a>."
Should I have my shoulders replaced?,"You have had quite a complicated orthopedic history, with dislocations of both shoulders as well as prior surgeries performed on both surgeries quite a while ago. Therefore, you case almost certainly requires some input from an excellent <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a>, so I would recommend that you start by making an appointment to discuss these issues. 

Generally speaking, shoulder arthritis is not initially treated with joint replacement. Usually, making sure that ant inflammatory medications are properly optimized is the first step, and this may be followed up with physical therapy or other exercises. There are also other surgical options short of joint replacement. These would include arthroscopic procedures in which small incisions are made and tools inserted into the joint space to help remove rough cartilage and scar tissue. 

Depending on the details of your prior shoulder surgeries, and what previous treatments for your shoulder arthritis you have tried, your orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> should be able to give you the best advice about what options are reasonable and safe for you. 

You will also likely need to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, given your long list of other medical problems, prior to any surgery just to make sure that proceeding with a surgery would be safe. "
"If no cartilage in knees, will I still be able to walk?","These symptoms sound really bad! I recommend that you go see your <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> right away about this issue if you have not done so already. There are lots of different causes of knee pain, and your doctor will be able to help you decide what you need to do to start feeling better. 

A lot depends on your age and medical history. For example, if you are a young person who is physically active, then an overuse injury of the knee, such as ""runner's knee"" is the most likely cause of your pain. These overuse injuries tend to respond well to rest, anti inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. 

On the other hand, if you have a more serious history of a knee injury, then you may have a ligament or meniscus injury which might require additional imaging (such as an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a>) and referral to an orthopedic doctor for consideration of surgery. 

If, finally, you are an older adult, then the likelihood that this is osteo<a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, or ""wear and tear"" arthritis, of the knees is much higher. This condition is a chronic problem which can be relieved with anti inflammatory medications but which often does require surgery to replace the knee joints. "
I have a sharp pain in my low hip - why?,"Hip pain is a very complex phenomenon, with so many potential causes, based on your age, activity level, and medical history. For this reason, it is really important to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, especially if the pain is persistent or worsening, so that they can help narrow things down for you. 

For example, if you are young and relatively healthy, then a common cause of hip pain is overuse from exercise. Strain or inflammation in tendons running down the side of the hip towards the knee, called iliotibial band syndrome, is probably the most common cause of hip pain in young, active folks. Another common cause is bursitis, which is an inflammation of the fluid filled pouches which surround and cushion the hip joint. On the other hand, if you are middle-aged or elderly, then by far the most common cause of hip pain is osteo<a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a>, or wear and tear arthritis, of the hip joint. 

Rarely, hip pain can be an emergency, if there is a bacterial infection inside the hip. When this occurs, there is usually <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, extreme pain, and redness or swelling over the hip. If you have any of these serious symptoms you should go to the emergency room; otherwise, see your primary care doctor at your earliest convenience. "
Will my mom ever be able to turn her head again?,"I am very sorry to hear about the horrible accident that you and your mother had. I am grateful that you are both alive! 

Unfortunately, it sounds like your mother suffered very serious trauma to her neck and spine. Sometimes, when this happens, the only solution is to fuse all of the bones together and stabilize them with titanium bars, as was done. This is because the priority here is to protect the spinal cord and prevent permanent paralysis or even death. Fortunately, this procedure was successful in your mother's case. However, she will never regain the lost mobility. Currently there is no technology that would restore the normal flexibility of her spine. 

This doesn't mean that your mother shouldn't have regular followup for her condition. In particular after an accident like this there can often be significant chronic pain, and this is a condition that should be aggressively managed to improve her quality of life as much as possible. 

She should have regular visits with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for these issues, and she might also benefit from seeing her orthopedic or spine doctor from time to time. 

Good luck to you both!"
I broke my foot - what should I do?,"I am sorry to hear that you had this <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to the foot, which sounds like it is becoming more and more painful! The good news is that you already have an appointment set up with the orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a>, and what you could do is give his office a call and let his staff know the new symptoms you are having. Based on this, he may have new recommendations for you (about weight bearing, for example).

Many times, fractures of bones in the foot are quite minor and do not result in significant displacement of the bones. For this reason, many of these injuries are treated as the orthopedic doctor recommended in the emergency room, without hard casting and with <a href=""/procedure/wheelchair-crutches-1243"">crutches</a> and partial weight bearing. Although most of the time this treatment strategy works just fine, sometimes the weight bearing may cause too much pain and swelling around the site of the injury. Since you already have crutches, you could probably just rely more heavily on them and avoid weight bearing for the next few days until you hear back with advice from your orthopedic doctor. Also, if you had any anti inflammatory or pain medication prescribed for you in the emergency room, that should help as well ."
How feasible is ACL surgery for someone with Spina bifida?,"There is nothing about spinal bifida in and of itself that would absolutely prevent you from having a surgery on your knee. In fact, people with chronic musculoskeletal problems from spinal bifida, cerebral palsy, and other life-long neurological conditions are often among the patients who benefit most, in turns of quality of life and improvement in function, from orthopedic surgical procedures. 

Therefore, what I would suggest is that you go ahead and meet with the <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> who has been recommended to you by your primary doctors. That surgeon will be able to perform an overall evaluation of your situation and of your specific <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> and make recommendations about whether or not surgery is a good option for you. 

Sometimes, ACL injuries settle down with time and do not require surgery, depending on how severe the tear is and how unstable the knee is afterwards. I think from your question that you say it has been only 2-3 weeks since your injury; if that is the case, there is still plenty of time to allow the inflammation to go down and healing to occur. Therefore, the orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> may recommend rest and physical therapy for a while instead of surgery. "
"I am a pitcher, and have had shoulder pains in my throwing arm for 4 years. What is it?","I am sorry to hear that you are having persistent problems with your shoulder! Unfortunately, chronic shoulder problems are very common in pitchers because of the repetitive strain to the joint with the throwing motion. 

If you have not talked to a <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> about this, I would highly recommend that you start with that. If your team has a sports medicine doctor on staff, that might be a good place to begin. <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">Sports medicine doctors</a> are highly skilled at diagnosing and treating basic joint injuries, usually through a combination of stretching, rest and grade exercise, and physical therapy. They can also help you figure out whether your shoulder issue is more serious and might require a visit with an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a>. 

The role of the orthopedic surgeon in the treatment of shoulder injuries is to help determine whether there is something going on in the shoulder that requires an invasive intervention. Examples of the kinds of shoulder injuries that can benefit from surgery include a torn tendon in the rotator cuff, or severe damage to the cartilage inside the joint. 

Both doctors might also recommend additional imaging, such as an MRI of the shoulder, to help define a bit better what exactly is going on inside the joint. "
"I jammed my middle finger six months ago, so why is it still swollen and bending towards my index finger?","I am very sorry to hear that you had such a severe finger <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> and that it is still giving you trouble even after six months. If you have not talked to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, that would be a good place to start. They can examine your finger for signs of proper healing and help you decide whether anything needs to be done. For example, if there is significant deformity, your primary care doctor might decide that you need to be evaluated by an orthopedic hand doctor. 

A ""jammed"" finger is another term for a sprain. A sprain is an injury in which the ligaments that surround joints become stretched or torn, leading to pain and swelling. Since ligaments have very little blood flow, they heal very slowly. This is the reason why a sprained finger might remain swollen for many months after the initial injury. 

Most of the time, if the finger is still swollen, you just need to wait a bit longer as things do tend to get better eventually. However the fact that you say the finger is bent to the side is somewhat concerning, as it may indicate a serious ligament injury or a poorly healed finger <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>. Your primary care doctor can decide whether these possibilities need to be investigated."
Should I get my knee checked out?   ,"I would definitely recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this. Any persistent pain in a joint like this needs to be evaluated. Your doctor should be able to help figure out what is likely to be going on and also make recommendations about what you should do in terms of treatment. 

Given the locking sensations and popping phenomenon that you are experiencing, one likely possibility here is something called patello femoral pain syndrome. This is a condition in which the cartilage on the undersurface of the patella (knee cap) degenerates. This causes the patella not to track well over the underlying bone, causing the symptoms of pain and popping. The condition can generally be treated fairly effectively with a combination of anti inflammatory medications, good shoes, and targeted exercises to strengthen and balance different groups of muscles in the legs. 

In addition to this condition, the doctor will also evaluate for other potential conditions, including injuries to the various ligaments that surround the knee. 

Based on what they discover, in addition to the types of treatments I mention above, they also may recommend additional testing (such as an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of the knee) or referral to a specialist. Again, please see your doctor soon."
What causes my knee to pop and get stiff when I sit for an hour?  ,"If you have not talked to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue yet, I highly recommend that you do so. Any persistent knee pain really should be evaluated by your doctor so that you can get to the bottom of the cause of the pain and get set up with a treatment to relieve the pain. 

There are a few likely causes of your pain. The fact that the pain is worse with sitting and with climbing the stairs strongly suggests a condition called patello femoral pain syndrome (also known as ""runner's knee""), which is an overuse condition in which the cartilage on the underside of the knee degenerates, causes pain with pressure and tracking over the knee cap. Treatments for this condition include anti inflammatory medications, rest from vigorous high impact physical exercise, and leg strengthening exercises. 

Another likely cause would be osteo<a href=""/procedure/arthritis-190"">arthritis</a> of the knee, which is the ""wear and tear"" form of arthritis that tends to develop in middle age, but can develop earlier as well if there have been athletic or other injuries. Osteoarthritis is also usually treated initially with anti inflammatory medications. 

Start by seeing your doctor at your earliest convenience!"
What does my MRI report really say?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are having such persistent trouble with shoulder pain and limited mobility. Given the fact that you have had several cortisone injections and also have had a long course of physical therapy with little improvement, an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> was definitely an appropriate test to order at this point. 

There are several important findings on the MRI. One of this is that you have some arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint, which is the joint that joins the clavicle to the shoulder blade. This arthritis could definitely be the source of some of your symptoms. Furthermore, you have evidence of damage to the rotator cuff, which are the tendons which surround the shoulder joint and support movement of the arm and shoulder. In particular, there is some tearing of one of those tendons (the infraspinatus), although, fortunately, it is not a complete tear. 

What you probably need to do at this point is make an appointment with an <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a> to review the findings of the MRI and get some advice from them on what they think needs to be done now. There are several surgical approaches which might be reasonable at this point, including an arthroscopic <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, but the surgeon will be able to analyze your case and give you specific pointers on the risks and benefits of those approaches. "
Why do I have a lump on my elbow that makes my arm numb?,"I would recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue, especially since it has been persistent for the last year and the lump is growing. 

There are a few different potential causes of your symptoms, many of which depend on where exactly the lump is and also where the sensation of <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">numbness</a> or tingling is occurring precisely. For example, a common place for these lumps to appear is over the inside edge of the elbow. When this happens, there may be some compression of the ulnar nerve, especially if you accidentally bang the lump on a hard surface, resulting in numbness and tingling mostly down the pinky side of the hand. In this setting, the lump may be either a small cyst overlying the ulnar nerve, or it may represent a neuroma of the ulnar nerve itself. 

Based on what your primary care doctor finds on examination, they will be able to recommend potential treatment options. If there is actual evidence of nerve compression or any concern for a neuroma, your doctor will probably want to refer you to an orthopedic specialist to determine whether any surgical treatment is needed to remove the lump. 

Good luck!"
How long is the recovery for shoulder surgery?,"The rotator cuff refers to a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint and are responsible for moving and lifting the arm. When the rotator cuff is damaged, this usually means that there is a tear, either complete or partial, in one or more of these tendons. In the more severe cases, this does often require <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>. 

Unfortunately, tendons have very little blood supply, which means that they heal very slowly. Therefore, the recovery process after rotator cuff surgery is usually quite long. For example, initially after the surgery you will have to keep the arm still in a sling and will not even be allowed to move the arm at all. After several weeks in this sling, you will start working typically with a physical therapy who will begging to perform stretching exercises on the arm - at this stage, you will still not be allowed to move the arm on your own. Somewhere after 6 weeks after surgery, you will begin to perform small exercises on your own with the supervision of  a physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a>, gradually building up over time. The entire process can take more than 1 year, however! 

Please talk to your orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> about this issue. "
I think my menisci is messed up. What can I do about it?,"I strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. Any persistent knee pain or other joint symptoms really need to be formally evaluated by a doctor both to help you figure out what is going on and also to help you figure out what needs to be done about it. 

In people your age, knee symptoms can often be from sports and other knee injuries. These can include damaged menisci, torn ligaments, and other similar problems. When your doctor examines your knee they will be able to determine whether any of these potential injuries might be affecting you. If so, they may request additional imaging, such as an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a>, or they may refer you to an orthopedic specialist for additional evaluation. 

Even if there is no clear tear or structural damage in the knee, there are still many other potential causes for your knee pain, such as strains or overuse injuries. These injuries can often be treated very well by your primary care doctor with the use of <a href=""/procedure/braces-consultation-472"">braces</a>, anti inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. 

Start by setting up an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible, and I hope that you are feeling better soon!"
Should my knee still hurt almost two months after I strained a ligament?,"First of all, I am sorry to hear that you are still having pain in your knee and that things haven't seemed to have healed up as well as you had hoped. At this point, since you are still having significant weakness in the knee, I would recommend that you see a specialist about the problem, if you have not done so already. 

Although most cases of knee injury do not require specialist evaluation or treatment and can be managed by a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> (it sounds like this is who has been managing your case), when the pain or weakness persists more than a few months after the injury it is often quite helpful to get the specialist involved. This could be either an orthopedic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine specialist</a> in your case. 

In addition to performing an examination of your knee to see what might be going on, the specialist might also decide to perform additional imaging, such as an MRI of the knee. This imaging can provide detailed information about what persistent inflammation or injury might be in the ligaments of the knee and help to guide the discussion about whether surgery or another treatment is needed at this time. Good luck, and see your doctor soon."
Could having surgery on my knee give me pain in my thigh?,"First of all, I am glad to hear that you have recovered pretty well from your recent <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> and that things are getting back to normal! Since it sounds like your surgical issues have mostly resolved completely at this point, I think it is unlikely that the pain in your thigh is directly related to the fact that you had surgery, in the sense that it is not likely to be an infection or other surgical complication. 

However, the pain could be indirectly related to the surgery. For example, it is very common for people to be a little weak after a surgery like this, and there can be some imbalance in the recovery of the strength of the various muscle groups in the leg. This, together with any residual stiffness or pain, can lead to a funny walking posture or other form of strain on the muscles in the thigh, leading to soreness or pain such as what you are experiencing. 

Especially if the symptoms persist, I would recommend that you discuss the issue with the orthopedic <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> who performed the surgery, as they should be able to give you some advice on what to do. Alternatively, talk to your <a href=""/physical-therapists"">physical therapist</a> soon. Good luck."
Is back pain hereditary?,"Back pain is a complex medical condition which is partially influenced by genetics. For example, studies have shown that identical twins are more likely to develop some types of <a href=""/procedure/back-problems-122"">back problems</a> then siblings who are not identical twins, which makes a case for genetics. However, there are many other risk factors for developing back pain, and these other risk factors are, in most cases, probably more important than genetics. These risk factors include things like being over weight, smoking, physical strenuous work, and a sedentary life style. 

Therefore, although the fact that back problems run in your family might put you at slightly higher risk for back problems later in life, in reality these other risk factors (many of which you can do something about), are what I would focus on. Avoiding back problems is something that can often be done by paying attention to regular exercise, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight. 

Regardless, you should also discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>.  He or she can discuss your lifestyle and check you out for any evidence of emerging back problems. Good luck."
What causes calcium deposits?,"Calcium deposits can occur pretty much anywhere in the body, generally overlying a bony surface, such as, in your case, the wrist or your collarbone. 

Although a common assumption is that the calcium deposits much be related to getting too much calcium in your diet, this is actually not the case. In fact, you would definitely not want to limit the calcium in your diet, as this could predispose you to a lower bone density, setting you up for a risk of bone fractures later in life. 

On the other hand, calcium deposits most commonly form as a reaction to a trauma or to chronic irritation. A common occurrence, for example, is to have them develop at the site of an old sports <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>. In the case of a collarbone, they commonly develop after a collarbone <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> (I am not sure if this is what happened in your case). 

Regardless, in most cases, these calcium deposits do not cause any trouble and they do not need to be treated. Sometimes they may be a source of pain; in these cases, it is not a bad idea to discuss potential treatment with a <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> who, generally, should be an orthopedic specialist. Please talk to a doctor soon."
What can fix my tendonitis?,"I am sorry to hear that you are still having trouble with achilles tendonitis. If you have not been talking with a <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sports medicine doctor</a> or an orthopedic doctor about this problem yet, I would definitely recommend that you do so as they are experts in this condition and will be able to give you some good advice. 

Achilles tendonitis is typically slow to heal, and if you have been continuing to exercise through the condition, I suspect that it is probably time to stop. As long as you continue to put strain on the tendon, you are not allowing it the time it needs to heal; sometimes, complete and total rest does end up being necessary. Also, depending on what your <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctors</a> say, there may be some benefit to stretching exercises to try to loosen up the muscles in the calf so that they exert less strain on the tendon. 

In the most persistent and severe cases of achilles tendonitis, <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> might be necessary. An orthopedic doctor specializing in this condition would be best able to counsel you about whether or not you are to the point with the condition where surgery might be a good option. 

Good luck!"
If I have pain on one side of my back only does that mean there is something wrong with my muscles?,"I would recommend that you consult with your primary care <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">doctor</a> about this, especially if the pain is persistent or severe. 

You are definitely right that the most common cause of pain in the lower back on one side does have something to do with the muscle. What typically happens is that the muscles that run up and down along the side of the spine become strained or overworked, typically from things like bad posture (think: sitting at a computer screen all day long) or heavy lifting. When this happens they can become acutely inflamed and even, sometimes, go into spasm. This produces a sometimes severe pain located along the involved side of the lower back. 

The other condition that can cause pain on one side of the back like this is a slipped disk or a pinched nerve. Unlike <a href=""/procedure/muscle-strain-1176"">muscle strain</a>, however, either a slipped disk or a pinched nerve will usually produce pain that runs down the leg, not just limited right to the lower back. 

Either way, the first place to stop is your primary care doctor's office. They can evaluate your symptoms and help you decide what are the best treatments for your pain. 

Good luck!"
Could my mattress be causing my back pain?,"It is certainly possible that your new mattress is contributing to this new back pain that you have developed. It turns out that individual people respond quite differently to different types of mattresses. For example, you mention that a soft mattress may cause back pain, and this is certainly the case for some people, where the lack of firm support causes sagging of the back and strain on the back muscles. For some other people, however, a very firm mattress may cause pressure over bony prominences on the back and hips, leading to discomfort. 

You should discuss this issue with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who can help you determine if there is any evidence of a back problem, such as a muscle spasm or strain. If so, they can recommend medications to relieve the pain and also suggest some back exercises that might help to relieve the symptoms. 

It may also be that your back pain is unrelated to your mattress. For example, if you have recently changed jobs and are now sitting at a computer all day long, or are lifting heavy objects, then these might be the cause of your discomfort. These are also things you can talk with your primary care doctor about. Good luck!"
How do we know whether a lytic lesion is benign or malignant?,"I'm sorry to hear that someone in your family is having health concerns.  It is true that a lytic lesion found on <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> can indicate a malignancy.  There are several cancers that classically do have a lytic appearance on x-ray, including multiple myeloma, Ewing's sarcoma, or giant cell tumor.  However, there is an even longer list of the many conditions that also appear to be lytic on x-rays and are not cancer (including bone cysts, hemangioma, vertebral abnormalities).  In order to determine what is causing this finding, your family member's physician will need to review the x-rays with a <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> and put this in the context of your family members age, health history, symptoms, findings on clinical exam, and additional findings on the x-ray.  Which bone or bones have this abnormal appearance is actually very relevant, as lytic lesions in vertebrae have a very different list of diagnostic possibilities than a lytic lesion in a hipbone, for example.  If your family member does not have a primary physician, this would be the time to get one.  However, it sounds like someone ordered this x-ray, so hopefully she can follow up with that physician to determine if any further testing or referrals are needed."
Can you please help me understand these test results?,"It sounds like these are the findings from an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of your lower back and spine, which I assume that you had done because you were having some back pain. MRIs of the spine are notoriously difficult to interpret, because often findings on the MRI may not correlate very well clinically with the pain you are experiencing. Therefore, it is very important to discuss these results with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your back doctor, whoever is managing your pain and other symptoms. They are the only ones who know you well enough to say whether or not these findings explain your symptoms. 

""Transitional anatomy"" means that there is partial fusion of the lumbar vertebrae, making them appear more like the sacral (tailbone) vertebrae. This is also what ""sacralization of L5"" means. This is a common spinal anatomic variant which is found in a small but significant percentage of the population. There is some evidence that people with transitional anatomy may be more predisposed to back pain from nerve pinching, but this is not necessarily the case all the time. You also have a bulging disc at the L4-L5 vertebral level which might explain some pain symptoms, if they localize to this region. 

Please talk with your doctor to get help interpreting the findings. "
Why do I have chronic microvascular ischemia?,"This is a good question to ask your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Chronic microvascular ischemia is a nonspecific finding that is commonly picked up on <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> scans of the brains. Essentially what it means is that blood flow to certain areas of the brain are slightly reduced. This tends to occur as we age, as the arteries that carry blood to our brains (and elsewhere in our bodies) narrow and harden. 

You are absolutely correct that there is an association between a deterioration in the health of the arteries and chronic medical problems like diabetes, <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>, and high cholesterol levels. However, because of age-related and genetic factors, there may still be some arterial degeneration even in the absence of these problems. 

Most people with mild chronic microvascular ischemia do not have any symptoms as a result, although it should highlight the need to stay healthy and prevent the emergence of medical problems like diabetes. I would suggest that you discuss this finding in more detail with your primary care doctor to see if they have any more thoughts. In particular, it is important to make sure that this finding is not related in any way to the symptoms you were having that led to the MRI in the first place. "
What does fluid in the pelvis mean? ,"It is very hard to interpret these finding on MRI without knowing more specifically about your case and your symptoms. For this reason, I would strongly recommend that you schedule a visit with the <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> who ordered this test; they should be able to explain to you what they are thinking and what they think the MRI findings mean. 

Very generally speaking, fluid in the pelvis on an MRI scan is a very nonspecific finding. Anything that causes inflammation of the organs in the pelvis can be associated with fluid there. For example, <a href=""/procedure/endometriosis-1455"">endometriosis</a>, in which tissue from the uterus escapes into the abdominal cavity, could cause this. Similarly, an inflammation of the reproductive organs, like pelvic inflammatory disease, could also cause fluid in the pelvis. 

Fluid in the pelvis could also be caused by conditions not related to the female organs. For example, if you had colitis, or inflammation of the colon, as could occur in Crohn's disease or in ulcerative colitis, this could lead to fluid. Trauma or <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> anywhere in the abdomen can lead to a leakage of blood into the abdominal space, and this can collect down in the pelvis regardless of where the original injury was. 

Talk to your doctor!"
What will an MRI show my doctor?,"An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a highly technical and informative way of imaging the human body. The images that are created can be very useful to your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctors</a> for detecting structural abnormalities of different organs, inflammation of soft tissue, and tears of muscle or ligaments, among other problems. MRI, like all other imaging abnormalities such as CT scan, x-rays, and <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>, does not provide any information beyond the images produced. In other words, the doctor reading the imaging (the <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a>) cannot make any definitive statement about the symptoms that a patient may be experiencing based on the scan. 

Images allow doctors to make reasonable (and sometimes very accurate) estimates about the clinical scenario, but cannot provide the doctor with an exact level of pain that you may be experiencing. For example, a doctor may see inflammation of the pancreas on the MRI and may infer that the patient has pain in his/her upper abdomen, but would not be able to quantify how much pain the patient is in. Pain is a subjective feeling that is difficult to measure, and so it is very important that you communicate to your doctor exactly what you are feeling in order to be treated appropriately. It is advised that you seek out the help of your doctor to discuss your questions further."
What is a lobular hypoechoic mass?,"This is an important question to discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or whichever doctor ordered the mammogram and ultrasound. As your doctors may have told you already, the BI RADS system is a formal grading system that is used by <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> to help determine how likely breast masses that are visualized with mammography are to be cancerous.BI RADS 4 is a category which contains abnormalities which are at least potentially not benign. For this reason, it is important to have a biopsy of virtually all BI RADS 4 category masses. 

Similarly, it sounds like, based on your question, you have also had an ultrasound of the mass in addition to a mammography. The ultrasound also shows some characteristics of the mass (such as lobular nature) that are also potentially concerning. 

In short, both the mammogram and the ultrasound suggest that you need to proceed to a biopsy. Although there is a good chance that the mass is not cancerous, it is important to find out for certain. Please talk to your primary care doctor about this, or which ever other doctor ordered the mammogram and ultrasound. They should be able to make a referral for you to a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> who can perform the biopsy. Based on what the biopsy results show, your doctors will be able to tell you what to do next! "
What is ligamentous laxity?,"You will need to go see the <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> who ordered the <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> in the first place. They are the only ones who will be able to interpret these results for you accurately, since they know your whole situation and the symptoms that you are experiencing. 

The most common joints in the body that have ligamentous laxity from time to time are the joints of the legs and feet - knees, ankles, and foot bones. Assuming that you had an MRI of one of these parts of your body, then ligamentous laxity might be a sign of a form ligamentous <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a>, typically from a sports injury. 

Ligamentous laxity can also be hereditary in some families and could in that setting be a sign of a connective tissue disorder. 

Regardless, please go see the doctor who ordered the MRI. They will be able to common on the MRI findings and what they mean in terms of pursuing additional tests or treatments for your symptoms. "
How should I interpret this MRI report?,"Most of the time an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> of the spine is done because of back pain that is of an unclear source. Although you do not mention why you had the MRI done, I will assume that this is the reason. 

In that case, the only <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> who can accurately interpret these MRI results for you is the doctor who ordered the study, whether that was your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an orthopedic doctor. I say this because, whenever an MRI of the spine is done, it is very common to discover multiple minor findings, such as arthritis at various levels of the spine. However, if these findings do not correspond to the type or location of your pain, then they are not meaningful. 

You do have a number of findings consistent with degeneration and wear and tear in the spine, at multiple levels. However, again what is needed is for your doctor to sit down with you and help you determine if any of those findings could potentially be the source of your symptoms. 

Also, you have a cyst like growth in your thyroid gland, which was discovered incidentally and is probably a benign structure. However, your primary care doctor may want to get more imaging to explore it further. Please see your doctor soon."
"What does ""transitional vertebra at L5"" mean on a radiology report?","It sounds like you have had some back pain or other symptoms if you are having imaging studies of the lower back.  In general, transitional vertebrae refer to a congenital or developmental anomaly in which a vertebrae has the characteristics of two different types of vertebrae.  They typically occur at the junction between two different types of vertebrae, i.e. the cervicothoracic junction, the thoracolumbar junction, or the lumbosacral junction.  Each type of vertebrae (cervical, thoracic, lumbar) has distinct physical characteristics such that a <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> can look at the bone itself and say exactly which type it is.  In some people, during embryonic development the last or first vertebrae of a particular segment will not develop normally and will instead look like a hybrid of the two different vertebral types.  Your radiology report suggests that your last lumbar vertebrae (L5) actually resembles a hybrid of lumbar and sacral anatomy.

Transitional vertebrae are not that unusual, and there are undoubtedly many people who have them but don't know that they do because they have not had imaging of their back. In your case, it sounds like you are having some kind of symptoms to have had this imaging done.  The best thing to do in this case is to follow-up with the physician who ordered the study so that he or she can go over the results with you.  Radiology studies can show many things that are not symptomatic--you need to go over this report with a physician who can go over your history and physical exam to see if any of your symptoms or exam findings may relate to this imaging finding. "
What is a rectal contrast?,"A <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a> (also known as ""CAT scan"") is an imaging test which takes serial <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> images of your body and reconstructs it using computer software to create an image of internal organs and structures. This is a great test, but there are several things that can make it even better. Giving contrast highlights specific organs and/or structures to give a better view or image of the organ in question. IV contrast is given to look at blood vessels and organs that are highly vascularized (for example: the liver). Oral contrast is given to look for bowel obstructions. Rectal contrast is a liquid which is given by way of injecting the contrast into the rectum to highlight the colorectal anatomy. This is administered similar to how an enema would be given. Usually this is done to give better visualization of the lower GI tract (specifically the colon and the rectum). Sometimes giving rectal contrast can detect, strictures, masses, or leaks. 

After the contrast is administered, the CT scan can be performed. What this entails is for the patient to lay on a bed which then moves through a CT scanner gate. The entire test usually only takes 3-4 mintues, depending on how much of your body is being scanned.

I recommend that you speak to your physician, who can give you more information regarding details of your testing. "
Is a diagnois of a shadow on my liver CatScan a problem?,"This is a difficult question to answer specifically without having more details about the technical information in the <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a>. I say this because, most of the time with a CT scan, the term 'shadow' is not used in the technical report. In other words, I suspect that your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> told you that this was a 'shadow' because they were trying to explain the report in simple terms, but it is hard for me to guess exactly what they meant to communicate to you. 

Nevertheless, it is likely that some abnormality was found in the liver on the CT scan, based on what you are saying. This could be a tumor, a cyst, or several other possibilities. It could be a benign finding, or it could be a serious finding, but you will need to go back to the doctor who ordered the CT scan to get a better sense of this. 

Ideally, in a visit to the doctor who requested the CT scan, they will be able to explain to you exactly why they ordered the CT scan, what abnormality was found on the CT scan, how they think that abnormality might relate to your symptoms, and what the next steps are in diagnosis or treatment. "
How do you prevent osteoporosis?,"Osteoporosis, as you probably know, is a weakening of the bones with age. It is a serious problem, because it can lead to a tendency for the bones to <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>, which can cause serious disability late in life. 

The best first step for you would be to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Screening for and preventing osteoporosis is one of the major topics that is addressed in an <a href=""/procedure/annual-physical-76"">annual physical</a> exam, so if you have not had your annual physical in a while that would be a great place to start. 

Make sure to tell your doctor about your family history of osteoporosis. They will be able to make an individualized assessment of your risk factors for osteoporosis and make recommendations. For most young people, this generally just involves staying physically fit and taking in plenty of calcium and vitamin D in your diet. In selected cases, your doctor may also want to take some blood to measure your vitamin D level. In older people, especially women, the doctor will often recommend bone density testing as an additional way to assess bone health. Bone density testing might also be recommended if you have certain chronic medical conditions or take certain medications like steroids. 

Start by talking to your doctor at your next checkup!"
Are x-rays dangerous for older people?,"First, it is good that you are concerned about your mother's health and are involved in her care. All of us need advocates to help make sure that we get the best healthcare, and your efforts will go a long way to helping your mother do as well as possible, no matter what her condition may be. X-rays are performed by releasing radiation that passes through the body and onto a film on the other side. The radiation passes through most of the body easily, but it stays in the parts of the body that are more dense, such as the bones. The film on the opposite side of your body doesn't develop in the corresponding area, and so it appears white. X-rays are thus excellent for diagnosing bone problems and some other simple conditions, but are not great for many of the soft tissue problems that we would like to visualize (in which case an <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> or CT with contrast may be used). X-rays themselves use very little radiation, and pose minimal risk. CT scans should be used judiciously, however, as they are made of many x-rays. Elderly people are at decreased risk, however, as the major risk from the radiation is the potential it has to disrupt the DNA and potential lead to cancer, which occurs over long periods of time (decades), and is thus not as relevant. Please speak to your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> about your concerns. "
Can I have an x-ray if I am pregnant?,"X-rays are done by allowing radiation to penetrate the human body and pass through to the other side. As some organs and tissues absorb radiation more than others (bones absorbing more than others), the radiation doesn't pass through and those areas are white on the film after it is developed (because less radiation reached the film to cause it to turn black). As you state in your question, there is always some risk associated with radiation exposure, specifically the risk of causing cancer or other changes in the rapidly growing cells in the body. For that reason, pregnant mothers are often spared radiation, or at least it is minimized as much as possible (as by using a lead shield to cover your baby). That being said, there are some cases where the exposure to radiation is worth the risk. Some illnesses can be so threatening that a low risk of a future problem (as caused by radiation exposure) is needed to avoid a more serious problem now. Most simple x-rays (not CT scans) provide very limited radiation exposure (roughly equal to what a person would get flying on an airplane), and can be used judiciously. Please speak with your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> about your concerns. "
Is there any way to predict an aneurysm?,"For most people, screening for aneurysms is not an effective exercise. As with most rare diseases, looking for aneurysms in otherwise healthy people is not an effective thing to do, both from a cost and a health point of view. 

First, looking for aneurysms generally requires some sort of imaging such as a CT. Even though this imaging isn't 100%, there are a certain number of people who can have an allergy to the dye used in the imaging process, and also a certain number of people who will develop cancer because of the extra radiation exposure. Those risks negate or at least reduce the net benefit of finding only a very small number of people who would actually have an aneurysm that would show up on CT. 

There are exceptions, however, which generally occur when the pretest probability is higher. For example, if there is a good chance that you have an aneurysm because of either family history or a medical condition that you may have, your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> may wish to screen you for aneurysms. 

It would be worth it because your doctor would have at least some reason to believe you have one. Please speak to your doctor for more information."
How is breast cancer diagnosed?,"Breast cancer is a common problem which can have devastating consequences. As such, there is a lot of research, time and effort determining the best way to catch breast cancer early. Breast <a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">cancer screening</a> -- or looking for breast cancer before symptoms -- is a hotly debated issue.

Mammograms have a proven benefit. We know that women who have mammograms starting at age 50 have a benefit of detecting cancer early. There is some debate about how often to have the <a href=""/procedure/mammography-no-breast-cancer-history-252"">mammogram</a> (every year or every other year). There is also some debate if starting at age 40 or 50 is best (but many people will start at 40). Regardless, this is a great study that works.

Self exams are a complicated issue. We know that people who do self exams don't necessarily (in large trials) have a benefit. For every early lump that is detected, there are as many false lumps that are detected. The problem with detecting these false lumps is that it forces people to get unnecessary biopsies and procedures. Overall, most doctors do not recommend self breast exams. I do encourage all my patients to call me if there are new lumps that they notice -- but the routine process of looking for them is not recommended.

Mammograms work. Talk to your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> for more information."
Does a SPECT create a 3-D picture of my insides?,"SPECT is an acronym for single photon emission computed tomography.  This is an imaging modality that falls under the umbrella of nuclear imaging.  There are two features that make SPECT and other nuclear imaging distinct from most other forms of radiologic tests.  First, in most radiologic studies, a beam or external force is applied to the patient's body and is picked up by a detector, producing a still image based on the effect the body has had on that external force.  

The simplest example is a plain <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">X-ray</a> image.  An X-ray is passed through the body and absorbed by film behind the patient.  Different parts of the body absorb either more or less of the X-ray energy and based on this principle a still image is created on the X-ray film.  In nuclear imaging, the patient is given a chemical substance (called a tracer) that actually produces the energy beams on an atomic scale from within the body, which are then used for imaging.  In this way the patient becomes the energy source and a detector scans the patient and processes the information to produce an image. 

The other special characteristic of nuclear imaging is that it occurs in real time.  Whereas most radiologic studies give a picture of the body at the exact point in time the study was done, nuclear imaging tests such as SPECT give results over time as a detector slowly scans the patient's body.  This allows radiologists to study not only what the body looks like, but also how it works.  SPECT is a type of nuclear imaging study that is particularly useful in determining how well blood is flowing to various organs.  

For this reason is is often used to see how well blood is flowing to different parts of the heart, but there are some other applications such as studying the brain in patients with seizures.  Because the scanner for SPECT captures information over time, it can rotate around the patient and thus it can produce a 3D image, not to mention many other views of the organ being studied, which allow radiologists to gain as much information as possible from the test.  For most people, the SPECT scan is a very safe study.  The tracer chemical used is radioactive, which is unnerving to some patients, but the radiation level to which you are exposed is actually very low.  

The lowest amount of radiation possible is used and is typically an amount equal to what you would receive from the environment over the course of one year (low levels of radiation come in from space and we are always exposed to them by virtue of living in this universe).  The most common complications patients experience from a SEPCT scan are pain, bleeding, or swelling where the needle is inserted into your arm to inject the tracer.  These are usually minor.  A very small number of people can have an allergic reaction to the tracer chemical.  Although there are some possible risks to the SPECT test, most people experience no complications at all.  The information the test can give your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctors</a> is substantial and if they have recommended the test, this means that the benefits of the information they expect to gain from the test far outweigh the minor risks of the study.  

For specific information on why you need this test and the risks specific to you, I would suggest you call or make an appointment to speak with the doctor who ordered the test or the <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> who will be performing it."
Should I ask about side effects at my adiation oncology consultation?,"You should absolutely ask about side effects at your radiation <a href=""/procedure/oncology-consultation-383"">oncology consultation</a>.  Radiotherapy can be a potent therapy to combat cancer, and sometimes offers a much better chance of cure or a marked improvement in the overall course of the disease.  

Is is true, however, that radiotherapy comes with side effects.  Most pronounced among these is direct damage to the surrounding healthy normal tissues.  The effects of this depend on the areas involved; radiation to the lungs can produce an inflammation of the lungs called radiation pneumonitis, to the heart can produce inflammation and pain of the sack containing the heart called pericarditis, etc. Radiation also produces an increased risk of secondary tumors like sarcomas in the future.  Finally, radiation to the brain from so called whole-brain radiotherapy, most often used for brain metastases, can produce brain swelling and cognitive impairment.

These side effects are important to know about, however, they are only a part of the consideration when deciding whether or not to undergo radiotherapy.  Radiotherapy can offer great benefits to many types of cancer, and the side effects must be weighed against the risks of NOT undergoing radiotherapy (i.e. allowing the cancer to spread further).  This decision is best made through a careful conversation between you, your <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>, and your <a href=""/radiation-oncologists"">radiation oncologist</a>."
What is a lung PET scan?,"PET scan stands for Positron Emission Tomograpy scan. It is a diagnostic imaging test that uses radioactively labeled molecules to help visualize focal areas of high metabolism in the body. It is actually just a <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a>, but with one key difference. A molecule called FDG (fluoro deoxy glucose) is given prior to performing the test. FDG is essentially glucose (sugar) that has a radioactively labeled molecule attached to it which causes it to ""light up"" on the scan. 

The idea behind this is that these molecules enter the blood circulation but then go to areas that are highly metabolically active. For example, this test is often used to look for tumors or metastases from cancer, because cancer cells are hyperactive and have high metabolism. They therefore require a lot of sugar and thereby eagerly concentrate and consume (FDG). This causes the FDG to localize to the tumor cells and in turn causes this area to ""light up."" One of the pitfalls of this test is that it can also cause any area of general inflammation to light up as well because inflammation causes normal cells in the body to become more metabolically active as well. 

There is nothing really that he should do to prepare for the scan per se. That being said, your dad should definitely be encouraged to stop smoking, not just for the scan but for his overall health. There are multiple options out there including nicotine gum, patches and even medications that can help quit smoking. A <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> can help with smoking cessation counseling and therapy and it is highly encouraged that he sees a <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> and formulates a smoking cessation plan. "
Can an MRI angiography show blocked blood vessels?,"Yes, angiography is used to determine the blood flow to a specific area of the body, and <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> angiography is a newer and increasingly popular approach to angiography. The second part of your question is less straight forward, however, as it is impossible to say if any kind of radiographic imaging is likely to localize your problem. There are many things that can cause you to lose feeling in your foot, and many of them would not necessarily be visible on any kind of imaging. For that reason, the full history and physical examination which your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> will perform will generally provide the framework of the other studies that might be needed. 

If your doctor feels that you need an MRI angiography (also called an MRA), it could be because he or she is concerned that there is something compromising the blood flow to your foot, and an MRA may prove effective at providing the information that is needed to diagnose or treat the condition. Please speak to your doctor about the possible causes of the loss of feeling in your foot and what can be done about it, and be sure to mention any other medical conditions or symptoms that you may have. "
Does an MRI show spinal cord injuries?,"The short answer to your question is yes. 

The two main types of radiology studies that are used to look at the spine are computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (<a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a>) scans. 

CT scans are most useful for looking for broken bones. They tend to be used in trauma situations, for example after a car accident, to make sure that no breaks have occurred. However, CT scans are less useful for imaging soft tissues, like the spinal cord itself, muscles, discs, and ligaments. 

The MRI scan is the radiologic study of choice for imaging these soft tissues of the spine and back. Doctors will commonly order an MRI scan if they are trying to diagnose the cause of back pain, weakness, or other similar symptoms. An MRI scan will pick up on things like damage to the spinal cord itself, as well as slipped or bulging discs or pinched nerves in the back. 

After obtaining the MRI scan results, your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> will review them carefully and will get back to you with the results. Potential benefits of obtaining an MRI scan could include locating the source of your symptoms of pain or weakness (or whatever other symptom you have) and potentially targeting a treatment to the source. Talk to your doctor for more information."
Is an MRI on my breast better than a mammogram?,"There are multiple ways to evaluate a patient's breast, but it depends on what you are looking for. If you are asking about breast cancer specifically, no single modality is the best for everyone. Mammograms, <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">Ultrasound</a>, and MRI are all used on different patients under different clinical indications. 

Mammogram has many advantages when used for screening for breast cancer. It is quick and less expensive than other modalities, and also does not require the equipment and expertise that are necessary with the other two. Ultrasound is valuable for younger patients with more dense breasts, and is also less expensive, but it is somewhat operator dependent (in addition to other difficulties). It is generally not the ""final word"" on breast cancer. MRI can be very helpful at defining soft tissue variations and masses in dense breasts or in patients who have some reason to do more than the routine mammogram. However, they are very expensive and not everyone can tolerate holding still for a long time in a narrow tunnel as is often required. 

Your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> or <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> will be able to best explain the different options that are available, and make a recommendation about which is best for you. Please speak to him or her. "
Is it safe to do an MRI scan on my brain?,"A magnetic resonance imaging (<a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a>) study is a very safe imaging study. It is often used to take a good look at the overall structure of the brain, and doctors often recommend the study if there is a neurological symptom, such as weakness, trouble with speech, etc in order to make sure there is not a serious problem in the brain that could be causing the symptoms. 

An MRI study does not use any radiation, therefore there are no risks of being exposed to radiation or contracting cancer from the MRI study. The main drawback to the MRI study is that it requires you to lie still in a small machine for a while, so it can sometimes be difficult for people who suffer from <a href=""/procedure/anxiety-494"">anxiety</a> or claustrophobia. However, if this is not you, then you can safely undergo the test without any fears. The other reason you might not be able to have an MRI would be if you have any metal in your body (from prior orthopedic procedures, for example) as the MRI uses a strong magnet. 

After you have the MRI study done, your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> will want to review the results with you and will tell you if anything serious is detected. Please talk to your doctor for more information."
What information can mammography give someone lacking a family history of breast cancer?,"A mammogram is an set of X-rays of a patient's breasts. <a href=""/procedure/mammography-no-breast-cancer-history-252"">Mammography</a> is not generally recommended for women under 35, especially if you don't have a family history of breast cancer. The reason for this is that mammograms are not very good at visualizing any abnormality in younger people because the breast tissue of younger patients is generally denser and has less fat and more connective tissue in its composition. 

This makes it difficult to clearly visualize any significant abnormality. Because of this, it is often recommended to start with an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> to evaluate breast tissue in younger patients (under 35). This of course should first and foremost be precluded by a thorough history and physical examination by an experienced physician who deals with breast disease and women's health. Only if there is something abnormal found on history and/or physical is it usually recommended to have further testing done such as imaging. If you have no symptoms, and don't have a personal or family history of breast cancer, 28 is likely too early to start getting mammograms. However a careful self exam and consultation with a women's health specialist is advised if any concern arises regarding an abnormal mass, discharge, or feeling in your breast. 

I highly recommend seeing your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, or breast/women's health specialist if you have any concerns or worries regarding any abnormal signs of symptoms relating to your breasts. "
Can Interventional Radiology Treatment help people with liver cancer live longer?,"I am very sorry to hear that you are dealing with liver cancer, and that it sounds to be quite advanced. I highly suggest that you have an honest discussion with the primary <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctor</a> who has been managing your case, as they are the only one who will be able to provide you an accurate assessment of your current prognosis and what treatments might still be available to you. 

Interventional radiologists are sometimes involved in the treatment of liver cancer, particular in cases in which multiple tumors are present in the liver which are not amenable to <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> or other treatments. The interventional <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> approaches the tumor usually be snaking a catheter through a blood vessel until arriving at the tumor. 

Once the catheter is in position, several different treatments can be done. These include chemoembolization or radioembolization, which deposit chemotherapy drugs or radioactive substances directly into the tumor, which can reduce its size. Other options include using the tip of the catheter to ""burn"" the tumor, a process which is called radiofrequency ablation. 

Without knowing more about your case, however, I can't comment on whether these techniques are indicated in your case or would be helpful to you. "
"I was in a car accident this a.m., totaled car - go to er or not?","Wow, I am very sorry to hear that you got into such a bad accident. Definitely go to the emergency room. There are a multitude of problems that can occur with trauma, in particular head trauma. Even though you had an air bag that thankfully deployed, there is a potential for whip-lash <a href=""/procedure/injury-laceration-1061"">injury</a> to your cervical spine. Also if you developed a nose bleed and bump on your head, presumably you hit them on something which could have caused anything from a contusion (<a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a>) to a <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a>. As far as the nose bleed goes, it would be prudent to have a physician look in your nose to make sure that you haven't developed a septal hematoma which is a collection of blood underneath the mucosa of the septum (divider in the middle of the nose) which can disrupt the actual blood flow to the cartilage of the septum and cause permanent deformity. Beyond the relatively unimportant potential cosmetic worries of a septal hematoma, much more serious life-threatening issues can present themselves in a delayed fashion after head trauma such as something called a sub-dural hematoma. I am not at all saying that you have any of these things, but it definitely warrants a thorough examination by a trained physician to tell you that you are ok. My recommendation is to go to an ED. Best of luck and I hope this helps. "
How long does it take to get the result of an MRI scan?,"MRI or Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a diagnostic test that can be used to find or evaluate various parts of the anatomy. The benefit of MRI is that it does not expose the patient to any radiation (in contrast to CT scans which do have radiation exposure). MRIs can be used to evaluate bones/joints, brain/neuro anatomy, Pancreatic and biliary anatomy, and so on. 

In terms of timing, the test itself does not take a long time (the time ranges depending on what part of the body is being scanned and what exactly is being evaluated). The images themselves are usually available within an hour of having the test. But unlike a blood test that just looks at levels of a hormone or substance in the blood, an MRI is an imaging test, which has to be ""read"" by a <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a> trained in MRI interpretation which can take some time, depending on when (time of day, day of week) and where (large academic hospital vs small community hospital) the test is done. In most settings, the scan should be interpreted within 24 hours. In addition, it helps to know who ordered the test. Often times, an MRI is ordered by a specialist (e.g. <a href=""/neurosurgeons"">neurosurgeon</a>, <a href=""/orthopedic-surgeons"">orthopedic surgeon</a>, hepatobiliary surgeon, etc). If this is the case, oftentimes the doctor that ordered the test can interpret the test to an extent. 

Hope this helps. I would highly recommend discussing the results of your test with the physician that ordered the test. Furthermore, you can request the official radiologist's report which will discuss the findings of the MRI. You should go over this report with your doctor and discuss any further diagnostic tests or interventions. "
Is it safe to have an MRI performed?,"Your concern is a very common one.  <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> stands for magnetic resonance imaging.  There is no ionizing radiation (the harmful kind) in MRI scans.  Instead, the parts of your body that are being imaged are exposed to high magnetic fields.  This strong magnetic field causes the electrons (negatively-charged particles) that are associated with the atoms that make up our bodies to align.  Based on the magnetic echo that is sent back to the detector, an image is created that can determine types of tissue/fluids, etc.

MRI is generally considered safe for most people.  People that have devices implanted (pacemakers, automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators, vagus nerve stimulators, intrathecal pumps) need to check with their <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> to see if those devices are MR-safe.  Additionally, people that have had surgical clips placed for abdominal, cardiac, or intracranial procedures need to see if they have MR-safe clips.  Most recently implanted clips are MR-safe.

Finally, people that have been exposed to metal working (where microscopic pieces of metal could have been implanted in skin, eyes, etc.) and those that have street or prison tattoos (i.e., not tattoo parlor) should also be careful.  The latter frequently have large amount of metals that vibrate in the magnetic field. get very hot, and can burn skin.  The effect of MR on fetuses has not been studied, so most physicians try to limit MR exposure for pregnant women.  There are no known long-term effects of MR.

Other things to be aware of include claustrophobia (the MRI scanner is a tube that you go in) and loud noises (the MR scanner is very loud - it sounds like a super loud washing machine).  Most imaging centers provide ear plugs or headphones for patients to assist with this inconvenience."
Will undergoing mammography tell me if I'm cancer free?,"I am sorry to hear that you had breast cancer, but am happy to hear that you are a breast cancer survivor! This is definitely a good question to discuss with your breast <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> and or breast <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>. I am obviously not familiar with the specifics of your medical history (and oncologic treatment history), and cannot therefore give your the specific information target to you personally that you deserve. I am happy however to give you some general information about mammography. 

Mammography is a technique that uses low-dose X-rays to examine the human breast. It has been proven an effective tool used in the early detection of breast cancers, particularly those that are radio-opaque (show-up on <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">X-ray</a>) or have microcalcifications (calcium crystals are hard, like bone, and therefore show-up easily on X-ray). While mammography is routinely used as a screening exam, it is not 100% sensitive or specific. Sensitivity refers to a testing modalities ability to pick up the disease process if present. Meaning in this case that there may still be a cancer present that the X-ray doesn't pick-up. This makes sense because not all cancers are radio-opaque, or have microcalcifications, or they are just too small to be picked up. Specificity refers to how accurate a test is, meaning that if it is positive, is the disease process actually present. In this case, not every radioopaque mass, or mass with microcalcifications is a breast cancer. This is why abnormal masses seen on mammography are usually biopsied to get a tissue diagnosis. 

The shortcomings or mammography are part of why the current recommendations are to perform regular self exams, and have a physician perform physical exams, in addition to regular mammography. I do recommend discussing this with your breast surgeon however. Best of luck. I hope this helps.  "
Why do doctors use magnetic resonance imagine to find health problems?,"Magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced technique to look at detailed images of the body's inner organs and other structures.  The <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> differs from other techniques in that it uses a large powerful magnet to gather data needed to make the pictures.  These pictures that are developed can be constructed into 3 dimensional images if needed.  In addition soft tissue structures and nerves can be seen on MRI.  The disadvantages of MRIs is that they are expensive, the images can take some time to gather (up to an hour or more in the scanner), and they take longer to read.  Plus, the tube that you need to sit in to gather the data is small.  Thus, patients that are claustrophobic (fear of enclosed spaces) sometimes cannot have an MRI or they need to be sedated to have it done.  

X-rays are also used to gather images of the body, but the information is not nearly as detailed.  The images are only 2 dimensional, and only certain types of structures can be seen.  Plus the test uses radiation.  While the amount of radiation in an <a href=""/procedure/x-ray-251"">x-ray</a> is quite small, we like to avoid it whenever we can.  The advantage of an x-ray is that the test is fast, inexpensive, and can be read very quickly.  I hope this helps answer your question.  "
Is magnetic resonance imaging dangerous in any way?,"Magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced type of medical imaging that is excellent at looking at detailed pictures of the inner body.  <a href=""/procedure/mri-other-249"">MRI</a> has many advantages, and only a few disadvantages.  From your prospective, the MRI is not dangerous.  In fact, it is safer than almost all other types of imaging because it does not use any radiation.  X-rays and CAT scans use radiation to gather the data they need to make images.  While the amount of radiation in these tests is low, it can <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> up if you have many of them done throughout your life.  There are no long term complications to having multiple MRIs.  

The main problem people have with the MRI is the time it takes to have one (can be up to an hour).  In addition, if you have metal implants in your body, or if you have tattoos, then this can be a problem.  In addition, the tube that is used to take the images is small.  Thus people that have claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces) either cannot have them, or they need to be sedated to have them done.  Since you are having this done as a part of a study, this would not be ideal if you need medication to have it done.  This should be a judgment call by the doctor's that have placed you in this study.  Good luck.  "
Was my lymphedema caused by radiation therapy?,"I'm very sorry to hear that you required radiation therapy at such a young age. This is definitely a question that you should discuss with your radiation <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>, as they will know the specifics of your case, and be able to give you a more directed answer as to whether this is actually pertinent to you. Since radiation therapy is most commonly used for cancer, I presume this was the case with you (but it doesn't have to be, as there are many other indications for radiation therapy). However, without knowing what kind of cancer you had (or if you even had cancer), or the location, amount of radiation, size of the radiation port, etc I can't give you directed information. 

I can give you some general information about radiation therapy...ionizing radiation applies energy that can cause free radicals within cells. Free radicals are atoms or molecules that have unpaired electrons and are very detrimental to the cellular structure and DNA within tissues. Typically resulting in cell death. While the radiation is directed as exactly as possible to target the cancer cells, it will inevitably need to go through some normal tissue, and the effects of the radiation are not exclusive to cancer cells, but present within normal tissues as well. Unfortunately the bodies lymphatics are sometimes within the radiation field, and as a result can be damaged in the attempt to kill the cancer cells (akin to collateral damage). So it is possible to develop lymphedema after radiation therapy due to damaged lymphatic drainage. I have no idea if this is exactly what is going on with you however, so I would definitely recommend discussing your concerns with your radiation oncologist. I hope this helps. "
How often do people get hereditary cancers?,"There are many different cancers that have a genetic basis.  For breast cancer, the gene with the most evidence for breast cancer is BRCA1 (pronounced brak-ah one).  In normal patients, BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor protein (i.e., a protein that prevent tumors by checking DNA for errors and either repairing the damage or killing the cell before it turns into cancer).  In patients with a BRCA1 mutation, this check system is broken.  

In patients with a BRCA1 (or BRCA2, another similar gene) mutation, the risk of breast cancer is about 60% by 90 years old.  BRCA1/2 are also linked to ovarian cancer with a risk of 55% for BRCA1 mutations and 25% for BRCA2.  If there is a family history of breast AND ovarian cancer, it would be worth your family members with cancer to be screened for BRCA1/2 mutations as this could effect the other women in the family.  This tumor suppression gene mutations are very prominent in a family - nearly every woman in the family (or one side of a family) will have breast or ovarian cancer.  If you have a family member that has had breast AND ovarian cancer, this would be highly suspicious.  Additionally,  BRCA gene mutations have a higher incidence in families of Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity.

Finally, there are many other genes (some that we know and others that we don't) that may be associated with breast cancer.  Testing for many of these is not worth the cost or the benefit.  As such, it is important that you talk with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> about your concern and family history to ensure that you have appropriate <a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">cancer screening</a> (e.g., <a href=""/procedure/mammography-no-breast-cancer-history-252"">mammography</a>) at the appropriate intervals."
Will a breast x-ray spot any tumors?,"Don't feel like you are alone in asking this question, because it is relatively common. Mammography  (breast X-ray) is when low-dose/amplitude x-rays are used as a screening exam to examine human breast tissue. I am assuming that you don't have much experience with x-rays (or reading x-rays), but when looking at an X-ray some structures show up as darker than others, and some are lighter depending on the density of the object. Typically very dense objects like bone show-up bright white. <a href=""/radiologists"">Radiologist</a> reading mammograms take advantage of this effect since most cancers are slightly more dense than the surrounding tissue, making it possible to pick up abnormalities.

Also some cancers have something called microcalcifications (small calcium crystals...like bone) that show up as small specks of bright white. The abnormal findings on a mammogram can be quite subtle however, because every breast is different, and some people have relatively dense breast tissue to begin with, so a cancer might not show up as easily. Also a very small tumor may not show up on the X-ray. Furthermore, if the cancer isn't a different density than the surrounding tissue, then it won't look different at all. That is why currently it is recommended to perform regular self exams, in conjunction with a mammogram +/- an annual exam by a physician. 

The hope is that you will be able to pick up something on exam that wasn't picked up by the mammogram. I hope that this answers your question. If you have any specific questions about your own history or exam, I would recommend a consultation with your local breast <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>, or <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. Best of luck. "
Is DCIS a type of cancer?,"DCIS, or Ductal Carcinoma in Situ. The diagnosis is made based on pathology analysis of a sample of tissue from a breast. What it means is that a pathologist,when looking at tissue samples under a microscope, found malignant cells of the ductal epithelium, but it does not invade through the basement membrane. In simpler terms, this is a pre-cancerous clump of cells that has not developed into a full blown cancer and has not started spreading. You can't usually feel a DCIS lesion on physical examination. 

If left alone, 50-60% of patients with DCIS develop breast cancer in the same breast and 5-10% may get cancer in the other breast. 

Because of this, it is usually recommended to take the area in question out. There are two options for dealing with DCIS. 

One option is a prophylactic mastectomy can be performed. This means a <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> will take out all of the breast tissue from that breast. 
The other option is a lumpectomy and radiation. This means only a small part of your breast, the one containing the DCIS, will be taken out with the aim of getting 2-3mm of normal breast (margin) around the DCIS, followed by radiation therapy. 

Because DCIS, by definition, does not cross the basement membrane, most patients do not need a lymph node biopsy.

As a patient, you have the right to decide whether you want this treated, and if so, which option you choose. It is strongly encouraged that you speak to a general surgeon, a breast surgeon or a surgical <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> specializing in breast <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> regarding your options for treatment. "
What machines are used to look for cancerous growths?,"Detecting cancer early is important for both you personally as well as the entire population. As such, doctors have spent millions of dollars and hours in order to determine what tests are appropriate to detect or ""screen"" for cancer. If you have any questions, I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care </a><a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a>.

There are three major mechanisms to look for cancer. These three are used in healthy people to screen for cancer. The first is a mammogram. As you know, starting at age 40 (or 50) yearly or every other year mammogram can help detect cancer early and save lives.

The second mechanism to detect cancer is a <a href=""/procedure/colonoscopy-1035"">colonoscopy</a>. This is important in order to detect colon cancer. I would recommend talking to a primary care doctor about it. Normally, people start at age 50, but some need to start earlier. 

The third mechanism to consider is a PAP smear. This is done to detect cervical cancer and should be done annually. 

Outside of the above, there are other machines to look for cancer -- but these should only be done if there are symptoms. Cat scans or MRIs can also be used, but these are not helpful without symptoms. Talk to your doctor if you have any symptoms that you are concerned for being a sing of cancer."
How can one spot a cancerous growth?,"<a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">Cancer screening</a> -- or the process of investigating for cancer in an otherwise healthy person -- is a very important process. Many years and millions of dollars have been spent studying what are the best ways to look for cancers. I would recommend that you discuss this your primary care <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a>.

Firstly, keep in mind this is for screening -- which means the patient has no complaints. If you are having any complaints that <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> you -- this might require more testing than the standard screening.

In terms of cancer screening, for a women your age there is really only one very well proven technique to determine cancer. This is a pap smear -- or a test done to detect cervical cancer early. We know that by yearly exams we can prevent and reduce the severity of cervical cancer.

A skin exam is probably helpful, but this has never been proven.

In actuality, a breast exam is not necessary. While it is something you certainly could continue, we have know data that this allows us to catch cancer earlier. In fact, some studies have shown that women doing there own breast exam actually leads to more unnecessary biopsies than cancers found. Talk to your doctor about this.

Talk to your doctor. A pap smear is the one cancer screening that is very important for a women your age. Other studies -- like mammograms and colonoscopies -- are also needed for older patients."
Is anything more commonly used for radiotherapy than external beam radiotherapy?,"External beam radiotherapy is a commonly used therapy to treat specific areas of the body that have cancer.  In some cases of cancer, it is used with the intention of curing the disease.  In most cases, it is used to treat a tumor in a specific location that is causing problems for the patient.  In other causes it is used to treat a tumor that is in a spot that cannot be operated on surgically.  The radiation waves are directed into your body with the intention of destroying the cells at a specific location in the body.  The radiation <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> are able to place the radiation in just the right place to minimize damage to other parts of the body.  The symptom I here most people mention after they have had it done is a sunburned area on the skin where the beam entered the body.  

Most radiation therapy uses an external beam to deliver the radiation.  Another type that is occasionally used is brachytherapy.  This is a type of radiation therapy when small beads that contain radioactive material are placed around or inside a tumor in order to release radiation very slowly over time in that one location.  

They type of <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> you want to talk to about this is a radiation oncologist (as apposed to a <a href=""/radiologists"">radiologist</a>).  He or she can discuss the benefits, risks, and side effects of your specific procedure.  "
Is external beam radiotherapy dangerous?,"Radiation therapy is a growing field of medicine that is becoming more and more a part of what we do as doctors. While a thorough review is beyond the scope of this article, it is possible to give some general pointers. If your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> has advised EBRT (<a href=""/procedure/external-beam-radiotherapy-1145"">external beam radiotherapy</a>), it is likely because the risks of surgery seem to be greater. 

Usually, EBRT is used to treat things that would be difficult to reach with surgery, or things that would be compromised if surgery were the method used to treat. It has the advantage, in general, of preserving the current anatomy, instead of having to surgically alter it. That being said, all therapy has some relative disadvantages. While EBRT is becoming more precise every day, there is no way to only affect the involved tissue, meaning that there will be some radiation to surrounding tissue, and this damage will often be a permanent feature that may alter future therapeutic options. 

Many people will also have some nausea, vomiting, weakness, and other symptoms, that can additionally vary based on the body part that is being irradiated. Discussing these with the <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> who is performing the EBRT will help you to best understand what lies before you. Being strong before the treatment will improve your odds of tolerating it very well. "
Are the risks of a whole body CT scan worth it?,"The question of doing a whole body <a href=""/procedure/ct-scan-other-245"">CT scan</a> to look for a disease is an interesting one that is becoming more relevant as more and more radiologic testing is used in medicine. It is thought that the increased exposure to radiation will result in a very small increased level of some types of cancer later in life. 

This is likely not a significant risk for a single person, since the odds remain very low, but when thousands and millions of people are exposed every year, some people will have long term effects. In your specific case, it would be important to know what condition your <a href=""/radiologists"">doctor</a> is attempting to discover. The general rule in medicine is that tests should only be done if they will alter the management of a patient's care. If this CT scan is necessary to diagnose a disease, to give a prognosis, or to discover how the best treatment would be, then it might be a very necessary risk to take, especially since your personal risk remains low, as explained above. 

CT scans are excellent for many disease processes, but should be used with thoughtfulness. Your doctor will appreciate your concerns, and would welcome the opportunity to discuss these risks with you in your specific situation. Please talk to him or her in more detail about this. "
What can I do about my skin rash form Doxil,"Unfortunately, skin rashes are quite common with Doxil, as with many chemotherapy drugs. This is because, as a side effect of their attacking cancer cells, they also attack other rapidly dividing cells, such as skin and hair. 

The most common type of skin rash that happens with Doxil is called hand-foot syndrome, and is a red, peeling rash on the soles of the hands and feet. This reaction is usually pretty mild, although sometimes it requires reducing the dose of the drug. However, the reaction you are having sounds more severe, if it is spreading all over the body. I would recommend seeing your oncology <a href=""/oncologists"">doctor</a> as soon as possible to determine what medical therapy is needed. 

In the meantime, you should avoid irritating the skin areas with hot water or harsh personal care products, keep the skin well moisturized, and wear loose clothing. You can also take an over the counter antihistamine or use an over the counter anti-itch cream (ask your pharmacist about which brands are available in your local pharmacy). 

If these methods do not work, or if the rash worsens, then your <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> may prescribe a stronger cream or possibly even oral medications. If the skin begins to blister up in large areas, or if there is <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> or worsening pain then you should seek urgent medical attention. "
How can a person fight chemotherapy fatigue?,"Treating <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> associated fatigue can be extremely challenging.  Despite our best efforts, we usually do not succeed in completely treating this fatigue, but there are some things you can do which may help.  

The first thing to figure out if your fatigue is related to another problem.  Chemotherapy has the side effect of dropping your blood cell counts including your red blood cell line.  Low red blood cells (also known as anemia) causes fatigue and can be countered with erythropoietin injections or blood transfusions.  If your fatigue is not related to anemia, then it will be harder to treat.  You can start off by making sure that you are getting a full 8 hours of sleep at night, eating as regular as you can, and exercising as much as you can tolerate.  Staying active is the key.  If this doesn't work then another option is to <a href=""/procedure/add-adhd-hyperactive-179"">add</a> a medicine such as Methylphenidate or Modafinil.  These are stimulants which can help keep you awake better than Coffee during the day. 

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> and discuss this problem.  He or she will probably do routine blood tests and then recommend the strategy they are most comfortable with.  Hopefully it will work for you.  Good luck.  "
Does pain indicate breast cancer recurrence?,"You are understandably distressed about this pain.  Any time anyone develops symptoms near the site of an old tumor, there are worries about recurrence of that tumor.  The best physician to approach about this issue is the <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> you saw for you breast cancer.  

Pain can be caused by tumor recurrence in certain situations.  Most of the time, pain at a former surgical site (after it has healed) is due to nerve damage from the operation.  This pain can occur weeks to months after the site has healed and sometimes can take longer.  We call this neuropathic pain.  Usually when breast cancer comes back, it does so elsewhere at distant metastatic sites such as the bone or lung.  

The more important question is what your individual risk of having the tumor come back.  This is determined by how many (if any) lymph nodes were involved, and if all the tumor was removed.  From there, you should have a surveillance schedule in which you get checked out routinely.  If you are following through with these checks, then you are reducing the risk that a recurrence would go undetected.  

I suggest that you schedule another appointment with your oncologist.  The two of you can discuss what appropriate screening tools are necessary for particular stage of cancer (at diagnosis).  This way you can be more able to appropriately respond to symptoms you have as they come along.  Good luck.  "
Are weight loss and pallor change symptoms of lung cancer?,"Unfortunately, lung cancer is common among heavy smokers.  Thus any concerning symptoms in someone that has smoked for a long time warrants and immediate evaluation for lung cancer.  The best type of physician to see initially is a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> such as a <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a> or internal medicine doctor.  If lung cancer is found, then he would need a referral to an <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> that specializes in lung cancers.

Symptoms of lung cancer include cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, generally feeling tired.  Your husband's symptoms of weight loss over 6 months (that I assume was not intentional) along with low appetite in the context of a heavy smoking history is VERY concerning for lung cancer.  I am especially concerned because he has not seen a doctor in some time, so his cancer may being going undetected.  His pallor may be due to anemia (or low red blood cells), a common finding in anyone with cancer.  

I suggest that you make an appointment for your husband to see his primary care physician today.  He will need a more detailed evaluation of his symptoms along with a thorough physical exam.  Likely, he will need some chest imaging which may start with a chest x-ray then a CT scan.  Good luck.  "
Taxotere - How do I know if the effects of taxotere on skin and nails is severe enough to see a doctor?,"Taxotere is a drug commonly used in breast cancer treatment but as you are finding it can have many unpleasant side effects.   Like all other <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> drugs, Taxotere works by disrupting the growth of cancer cells. Unfortunately, it also disrupts the function of some other cells in the body, and the cells which produce skin and hair and nails are one of its prime targets. Although all chemotherapy drugs have some effects on skin and nails, Taxotere has a particularly bad reputation here.   Virtually all patients who take it can expected to experience dryness, thinning, and minor rashes of the skin. <a href=""/procedure/hair-loss-90"">Hair loss</a> is very common. Nails are also usually effected and can become deformed, pitted, or brittle. In more severe cases the nails fall out completely.   There is no firm line for saying when these effects are ""severe enough."" The best advice is that if you are bothered more than you thought you would be by the symptoms you should be examined by your <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> to make sure the symptoms are not too severe. Objectively, if you have multiple nails falling out, or if you have blistering of the skin or painful rashes, this could put you at risk of infections and probably means that it is time to discuss your options with your oncologist. "
What treatments exist for fallopian tube cancer?,"Cancer of the fallopian tubes is actually the rarest of all the gynecological cancers, with only a few hundred cases diagnosed each year. In terms of its symptoms it often presents like other gynecological cancers, with pain, bloating, and bleeding. It is usually suspected after an abnormal pelvic examination or an abnormal <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a>. 

Like other gynecological cancers, it is very important to diagnose spread to other organs as well as to prevent this. Therefore, all cases of fallopian cancer will require, unfortunately, a very extensive operation in which the uterus and ovaries as well as lymph nodes are removed. This is absolutely required, not only because it removes the tumor but also because the <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> forms the basis for the cancer staging system on which the treatment is based. 

After surgery, a number of further treatment options will be discuss with your friend by her <a href=""/oncologists"">cancer doctor</a>. These may include chemotherapy with a combination of medications or radiation therapy to the pelvis. Occasionally hormonal therapy is also offered. 

Because this cancer is so rare, it is likely best treated in a large cancer center with lots of experience. Therefore, it is worth asking if the center where your friend is being treated has had success treating fallopian tube cancer. "
What is the FIGO staging system?,"I am sorry to hear that your wife is dealing with fallopian tube cancer, and I hope that her <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> goals well. 

FIGO stands for ""International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics"" and it is an important international body of gynecology and obstetrics experts who set standards of medical care for many gynecological conditions. 

FIGO has produced a cancer staging system for gynecological cancers, which is what you are referring to. This system defines have far the cancer has spread - for example, is it just in the fallopian tube, or has it spread to the ovary, uterus, or even outside of the pelvis. In order to establish the FIGO stage, all of these organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus) are typically removed and examined for cancer. Biopsies are also taken through the pelvis and elsewhere looking for cancer. 

The FIGO stage is very useful, because it defines what therapy will be taken for the cancer going forward. It is a good question to wonder what the use of rating a cancer after removal is, but in truth surgery is the first step for nearly all gynecological cancer. Subsequently, the FIGO stage helps to define what followup <a href=""/procedure/chemotherapy-1010"">chemotherapy</a> and/or radiation is needed. "
What is capulized cancer?,"Cancer can be a very complicated disease from a medical perspective and a very frightening thing to think about as a patient or concerned family member. For this reason, questions about cancer in a patient with the disease are best answered by that person's treating <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a>, while concerns about <a href=""/procedure/cancer-screening-120"">cancer screening</a> are best answered by a primary care <a href=""/oncologists"">doctor</a>.

The term encapsulated cancer simply means that on microscopic examination, cancer cells are surrounded or 'encapsulated' by normal tissue.  It does not change a person's genetic risk.

When it comes to the genetic risk of breast cancer, there are several variables that should be consider.  The presence of certain genetic mutations  (you may be familiar with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations that are sometimes mentioned in the news) can lead to a greatly increased risk of breast cancer.  Other risk factors include a history of breast cancer in the family, especially first-degree relatives such as parents or siblings; age at first pregnancy; prior radiation exposure; age at first period and menopause; and being overweight. However, it is important to remember that having these risk factors does not mean a woman will get breast cancer and conversely, many women who get breast cancer have none of these risk factors. This is why regular exams are so important. Depending on your family history, your doctor may also decide to refer you to a genetic counselor for further testing."
What is a hypoechoic mass?,"The term hypoechoic is used when describing how an object looks and behaves while being examined by the <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> technique.  Hypoechoic literally means that it does not bounce back sound waves very well (does not echo the sound).  This is a very non-specific finding that means that you have a mass which needs to be further looked at by either more detailed imaging (MRI or CT scan), or it needs a biopsy so the tissue can be looked at in more detail.

Hypoechoic masses in the liver can be one of several things.  Liver <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a> which are collections of an infection can cause this.  Certain liver tumors including the hepatic adenoma and tumors that have metastasized to the liver can cause this type of mass.  While these are possibilities, there are many types of liver masses including the hepatic angiomas which are benign and are left alone.  Since there are many different possibilities with different outcomes, it is important that you follow this up with your <a href=""/oncologists"">doctor</a>.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with the physician that ordered the ultrasound.  He or she will be able to discuss the different possibilities this mass could be in the context of you past medical history and current physical exam.  From there, you can discuss the plan for further evaluation (imaging or biopsy).  Good luck.  "
How do chemotherapy and radiation differ?,"Cancer treatment often contains one or more of 3 possible treatments, <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are two different methods.  Chemotherapy is a generic term to describe a group of medications that act to stop or at least slow down the growth of tumor cells.  In some cases chemotherapy is able to induce cancer cell death. It is used when the physician wants to fight cancer that could be anywhere in the body because it travels through the blood stream to reach the cancer.  The downside to chemotherapy is that it comes into contact with normal tissue resulting in the unwanted side effects (examples: nausea and <a href=""/procedure/hair-loss-90"">hair loss</a>).  Radiation therapy uses a beam of high energy radiation that targets the tumor while leaving the surrounding tissue less effected.  Radiation acts to destroy DNA which can kill the cancer cells.  While these two modes of treatment are not necessarily curative with a pancreatic tumor, they will work better together than by themselves.  I suggest that you attend your mother's next appointment with her <a href=""/oncologists"">oncologist</a> (if she is okay with that).  This will give you a chance to ask these types of questions as well as questions dealing with the reasonable benefits and risks of the combination of this therapy.  "
Are there non-surgical methods to reduce breast size?,"Unfortunately, there are currently no reliable non surgical methods to reduce breast size. There are some promising technologies in development, such as using <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> to break down fat, but these methods are currently not available for use on the breasts. 

Some women do find that losing weight is an effective way to reduce the size of their breasts. However, it is likely that the size discrepancy between your breasts would persist even if you do lose some weight. Similarly, other women who wish to avoid surgery will focus on wearing support garments that help to smooth out the contours of the breasts and minimize the visual impact of the size difference. 

However, if these strategies do not work for you, then unfortunately your only remaining options would be surgical ones. It would not be a bad idea to make an appointment with a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> to discuss what your options might be. Just making an appointment does not oblige you to proceed all the way with treatment, and it would be a great opportunity for the <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">doctor</a> to discuss the various surgical options with you. That way, you can decide if there is one that it right for you. 

Good luck!"
Is there anything I can do to improve my asymmetrical face?,"I'm sorry to hear that this is an issue for you. Probably the easiest thing for you to address would be the ""crooked jaw"" and popping sound in the jaw that seems to come and go. These suggest that you may have an issue with the alignment of your teeth or your bite, which is something that your <a href=""/dentists"">dentist</a> or your <a href=""/orthodontists"">orthodontist</a> can check out for you. They can help make recommendations about any potential treatment options for this issue. 

Regarding the other issues, these are more complex and would require consultation with a <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">plastic surgeon</a> or a cosmetic surgeon. These physicians are skilled in performing surgical procedures to augment or change the look of various body parts, such as the nose, cheekbones, etc. Some of these procedures are more difficult or more costly than others, and setting up a visit with one of these specialists would be the best way to start figuring out what your options might be. Most of the time, cosmetic surgical procedures are not covered by health insurance, which is often a factor that limits what options you might have, but this is something to talk about with the doctor. 

Good luck!"
Could numbness in my hands be related to Cubital Tunnel Syndrome?,"I would recommend going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue . In some cases, it may be necessary to perform a special test, called a nerve conduction study, to make the diagnosis.

It does sound like your symptoms are most likely related to a nerve problem since the numbness and <a href=""/procedure/tingling-numbness-weakness-228"">tingling</a> quality to the pain fits with nerve involvement. Also, the fact that the symptoms started out worse in the pinky and ring finger, and the fact that you can elicit symptoms when you press on the inner aspect of the elbow all point towards the ulnar nerve as the most likely culprit. When the ulnar nerve becomes pinched, this can lead to cubital tunnel syndrome, as you have correctly noted. 

Mild cases of cubital tunnel syndrome or ulnar nerve compression can often be treated by avoiding behaviors that put pressure on the nerve (such as leaning on your elbows) and by taking anti-inflammatory medications. However, more severe cases may require <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to relieve the pressure on the nerve. 

Book an appointment with your doctor about this issue as soon as you can to have things investigated."
Unexposed pins in fingers - removal process?,"I'm sorry to hear that you had such a bad hand <a href=""/procedure/hand-injury-fracture-1093"">fracture</a> and had to undergo such an invasive surgical procedure. The good news is that it seems that the swelling is subsiding nicely, so hopefully things are healing up quickly. 

I would suggest that you call your orthopedic <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">doctor</a> or your hand doctor, preferably the one who performed the <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> in the first place, to ask about this issue you are having with the pins poking through. Typically those pins need to stay in place for a minimum period of time to make sure that the bones have adequately healed, and it is not clear from your question how long it has been since your accident. Therefore, I think the advice of the orthopedic doctor who knows your case best is important, since they will be able to give you a straight answer about when the pins might come out. 

Removing the pins is a surgical procedure, since it involves cutting into the skin and exposing the bone underneath. However, pin removal is a much more simple and quick procedure than putting the pins into place! Your orthopedic doctor will be able to answer any more specific questions you might have about this procedure. "
Cartilage damage? Could surgery fix it?,"There are several different possibilities here, but the fact that you have a ""popping"" sensation and a ""robotic"" or ""disjointed"" sensation when moving the finger suggest to me that the most likely cause of your symptoms is some dysfunction in the tendon. 

As you know, the tendons connect the muscles in the forearm to the bones in the hand and fingers, and they are responsible for applying the pressure to the finger bones that causes the fingers to move. The ""robotic"" motion suggests to me that there is some scarring or other damage on the tendon that is cause it to ""catch"" and move unevenly. Your symptoms could also be caused by other problems, however, include pieces of bone that are improperly healed or dislocated still. 

It is not possible to say whether or not this can easily be fixed at this stage without getting more information. What I would suggest is that you make an appointment with an orthopedic hand <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">doctor</a>. They are the ones who are skilled in dealing with these kins of injuries. They can perform an examination, and they will probably also want some additional radiology tests, such as x-rays. Based on what they discover, they can tell you if and how to fix this problem."
What should I do if my eyelid is drooping?,"I am sorry to hear that your left eyelid seems to be drooping, and that it is bothering you. Ptosis (the medical term for drooping of the eyelid) can be caused by many different things. Some of them serious, some of them benign. I don't have any of your medical information, nor am I able to examine you to give me more information to help tell you what I think may be going on, but what I can do is give you some general information about ptosis, and recommend what kind of physician I think you should see. One of the most common reasons that people come to a physician due to ptosis is actually dermatochalasis. Dermatochalasis is a problem where there is excess eyelid skin (typically the upper eyelid), such that it folds over itself when the lid is opened, and can impair the visual fields. This is typically a problem seen in older generations, and is relatively easily fixed surgically with a <a href=""/procedure/eyelid-surgery-blepharoplasty-1080"">blepharoplasty</a> (a ""lid lift"" done by a facial plastics <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>). Otherwise ptosis can be thought of in many different general catergories such as: neurogenic (such as a nerve palsy, or Horner's syndrome), myogenic (meaning the muscles to open the lid are weak as in myasthenia gravis), mechanical (like a tumor or mass that is preventing it from opening completely), etc... There are numerous different reasons (including idiopathic...meaning we don't know what causes it) for ptosis, but a history and physical exam by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> or facial plastics surgeon will help determine what is going on in your case. I wish you all the best. "
Is liposuction safe?,"Liposuction is a surgical procedure in which small cuts are made in the skin and excess fat tissue is removed using a specialized suction probe. The procedure is usually performed by a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. 

Generally speaking, liposuction is a safe procedure that is well tolerated. There are standard risks from the procedure that are associated with any surgery, including <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> and infection. However, these risks tend to be pretty minimal. 

When considering liposuction, I think it is important to consider, however, that removing fat tissue does not permanently solve the problem of being overweight. Although it is a quick solution, it does not address the larger issues of lack of exercise or unhealthy eating. Many people who have liposuction quickly gain the fat tissue back if they do not also engage in a regular exercise and diet problem. 

A cheaper and more sustainable way to improve being overweight is to start a daily exercise program, which should include at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days of the week. A visit to a <a href=""/dietitians"">dietitian</a> is also very helpful, as they can design a workable healthy eating plan that can reduce weight and keep it off over the long term. "
Are there health risks involved with liposuction?," You asked a few questions, each of which I will try to address. First of all, it is absolutely ok for you to just leave the fat that is present on your ""tummy"" and legs if it isn't bothering you. I obviously cannot examine you, but if you eat healthy, exercise regularly, and are not obese, then the choice of what is, and is not, a desirable cosmetic appearance needs to be a decision that you make. There are many different ways to remove excess adipose tissue (fat) surgically. It can be resected (cut-out), however a significant downside to this is that any time an incision is made in the skin, it will heal with a scar. <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">Plastic surgeons</a> are trained and skilled at minimizing scarring, or hiding scars, but everything heals with a scar. The other major way to remove excess adipose which you already mentioned is through <a href=""/procedure/liposuction-1086"">liposuction</a>. With liposuction a small puncture is made in the skin, and an instrument with a suction port on the side can be passed all around to agitate and suction the fat out. Every procedure has risks and benefits associated with it. In this case, any time that the skin is violated (whether through an incision or puncture), bacteria can potentially be introduced to an area that is otherwise sterile (like fat) and cause an infection. This risk should be low, but can be very serious. If you are considering liposuction as a real possibility, I would recommend making an appointment with a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> to discuss risks, benefits, and any concerns that you may have. I wish you all the best. "
How quickly can you develop bed sores?,"Bed sores (also known as decubitous ulcers) form after someone has been bed bound or chair bound for a prolonged amount of time.  They can begin forming after a week or so of lying in the same place, but usually begin getting serious after several weeks to months of being bed bound.  These sores form because of pressure being placed on one area of the body over a prolonged period of time.  This usually occurs in the back or buttock regions where the most pressure is placed when a person is lying on their back.  The pressure on these areas of the body causes a decrease in blood flow which causes the tissues under pressure to begin dying.  The sores begin as areas that are just red.  After that, the skin breaks down and the underlying tissue become exposed.  In extreme circumstances the sores can extend all the way to the bone.  These sores can be prevented by removing the pressure on the effected area.  This may involve getting the person up out of bed, or having them lye in different positions throughout the day to disperse the pressure.  Most hospital beds have built in mechanisms to do this as well.  In addition, most nurses are trained to look for them, and perform the necessary maneuvers to prevent the from happening.  

If your dad does develop bed sores, the best type of physician to treat them is a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>.  I hope this never becomes necessary, but if it does, you will know who to consult.  Good luck.  "
What are the risks associated with liposuction?,"<a href=""/procedure/liposuction-1086"">Liposuction</a> is an elective, cosmetic surgical procedure in which excess fat cells are removed from under the skin through small incisions using a vacuum device. The procedure is generally performed by plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeons</a>, and if you are interested in having this done you will need to set up an appointment with a surgeon who does liposuction. 

Generally, liposuction is very well tolerated. The main side effects are some soreness and bruising at the site of the procedure, which should go away in a few days to weeks. More serious potential complications might include an infection at the site of the incision or serious <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. Generally, these are unlikely to occur, and your surgeon will follow up with you closely after the procedure to make sure everything is healing as it should. 

As you know, liposuction is generally a temporary solution, because the tendency is for fat cells to regrow into the area that they are taken out of. However, if you have recently lost a lot of weight, that sounds like you have been successfully dieting and exercising, which is great. You will need to keep that up after the liposuction, however, in order to maximize your benefit from the procedure. "
How do I know if I need a breast reduction?,"The decision about whether or not to pursue a breast reduction is a very personal one.  If this is something you are considering, you should feel free to address your questions and concerns with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. He or she can help direct you to a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> for a <a href=""/procedure/surgery-consultation-432"">surgical consultation</a> if this is something you decide to do.

You are correct that being overweight can result in some of this extra weight being carried in your breasts.  In addition, larger-breasted women can indeed have back problems or posture difficulties secondary to this distribution of weight.  However, if you have never had back problems despite being overweight for a long time, it is unlikely that you will suddenly develop this because of large breasts.  Furthermore, having a breast reduction is not going to lead to weight-loss anywhere else or to any of the positive health benefits of changing your eating and activity habits.

Overall, if after consultation with your physician and a reputable plastic surgeon you feel that breast reduction will provide physical or mental health benefits, then pursuing this option may make sense for you.  However, regardless of what you decide to do re a plastic surgery option, you should also continue to work with your healthcare provider about making healthy lifestyle choices to preserve your overall health."
Is this cosmetic surgery unhealthy?,"Cosmetic surgery is becomingly increasingly common. With this trend, it is becomingly increasingly talked about. I would encourage you to have a frank discussion regarding this with your friend. In addition, encouraging him to have a frank discussion with his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> would also be of benefit.

Cosmetic surgery alone is not a sign of a psychiatric condition. While debatable, many people have valid concerns regarding their appearance and gain significant increase in self-esteem and confidence by the procedure. In these cases, this can drastically improve one's psychiatric state.

The condition we often <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about in people pursuing cosmetic surgery, often with repeat cosmetic surgery, is body dysmorphic disorder. This is a disorder in which the patient is excessively concerned regarding a perceived flaw in his or her appearance. By definition, this concern will result in impairment in social, occupational or emotional functioning. Patients often have concomitant psychiatric disorders like eating disorders or depression.

There is no specific way to diagnose the condition. A <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> can be of help. In general, if you have concerns that his preoccupation with his legs are significantly affecting his life functioning, that you should discuss this with him.

Keep in mind all patients should see their primary care doctor prior to any surgery for ""medical clearance."" Evaluation of this will/should include addressing this topic."
Why do I have diastasis recti?,"Diastasis recti is a common problem, especially in women, but it can also occur in men. Essentially what happens is that there is gradual separation of two bands of vertically oriented muscles, the rectus abdominis muscles, which are located in the front of the abdomen on either side of the belly button. This does not usually cause any pain or discomfort but, with straining, an elongated bulge can be seen running from below the breastbone down the abdomen. 

As you say, the most common for of diastasis recti is the kind that occurs in pregnant women from the pressure of the uterus on the abdominal wall. In men, the most common causes for diastasis recti are obesity (causing similar pressure on the muscles), or a history of vigorous straining exercises such as sit ups or weightlifting. 

Some cases of diastasis recti in men can be treated just with physical therapy. You should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who may be able to refer you to a physical <a href=""/psychotherapists"">therapist</a> who can suggest some strengthening exercises for the abdominal muscles. 

If exercises do not work, then you would need to talk to a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> about a possible abdominoplasty, or ""tummy tuck"", procedure. "
Is there a way to tighten up saggy elbows?,"Sagging of the skin tends to occur in middle age as the collagen fibers and other materials which give the skin its firm texture start to break down with age. Sagging is especially common in areas of frequent motion, such as the elbows and other joints. Sagging can also be exacerbated by recent <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a>, and it is very common for middle aged women to have an area of loose skin and flesh on the back of the arm overlying the triceps. 

The first step in dealing with this issue are the non-surgical options. For example, improving the tone of the muscles (such as the triceps) that underlie these areas of sagging skin can often help with the overall appears of the skin. You should talk to your personal trainer at your gym about what exercises you can perform to improve tone in your upper arms. 

After taking these measures, you would need to set up an appointment with a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a>. ""Arm lifts"" can be performed which involve making a cut down the underside of the arm and removing extra skin and tissue and then tightening up the remaining skin. Your plastic surgeon will be able to tell you if this operation is a possibility for you. "
What are the risks and advantages of abdominoplasty?,"Abdominoplasty (also known as a ""tummy tuck"") is a plastic <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> procedure in which excess skin and fat is removed from the front of the abdomen, resulting in a firmer, more toned appearance. Often, abdominoplasty also involves fixing any weakness or separation of the abdominal muscles that may occur with aging, fluctuations in weight, and pregnancy. 

The procedure is usually very well tolerated, but it should not be performed immediately after a C-section. Usually, <a href=""/plastic-surgeons"">plastic surgeons</a> will recommend that you wait a few months after your C-section at least until your weight has stabilized and your body recovered from the pregnancy; this will result in a better final outcome from the abdominoplasty. 

Abdominoplasty is very effective in repairing sagging skin and weak muscles. It is not, however, a safe alternative to <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> and exercise; in fact abdominoplasty should generally be postponed if a weight loss need is anticipated, as rapid fluctuations in weight will make the overall final effect less optimal. Also abdominoplasty will not cure stretch marks, if that is a major concern for you.

Risks of the procedure include bleeding, infection, scar tissue formation, and blood clots. Smokers are more likely to have these complications than nonsmokers. 

If you have any further questions about the procedure, you should set up an appointment with your plastic surgeon. "
Is there a way to make close-set eyes look farther apart?,"There is actually quite a bit that can be done to change the shape of the face, and make the eyes look further apart, even though the interpupillary distance (IPD) stays the same. You are also correct in stating that surgical repositioning of your eyes is not something that would be done on a healthy adult. There are conservative options that can be found by altering make-up or wearing glasses with certain types of frames, and an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> or even an <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a> might have suggestions in that regard. Assuming that you have already considered those options, the next best step would be to make an appointment with a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or head and neck surgeon who specializes in cosmetic surgery. Obviously, specific recommendations would require a personal physical examination, measurements, and, usually, photography. Depending on the structure of your face and your specific circumstances, he or she would be able to recommend altering the nose, the eyelids, or the surrounding soft tissue of the face. Of especial value, a surgeon would be able to help you in understanding the benefits and limitations of cosmetic surgery, and would help you to have realistic expectations before you decided to move forward. There is a broad range of variation within the normal population, and seeking multiple professional opinions before choosing elective surgery would also be in your best interest in addressing such a complex question. "
How can one lose weight on their face?,"This is a great question and a challenging one.  Unfortunately, there is no magic formula.  However, I think I can give you a reasonable overview as you continue your diet and exercise regimens.  Remember that your weight and your <a href=""/procedure/weight-loss-1011"">weight loss</a> techniques are critical aspects of your health and should be discussed with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> at every visit.

Weight loss patterns very widely from person to person because of different body types and genetic backgrounds.  Loss of facial fat almost universally isn't noticed until a person has lost much of their abdominal weight.  In fact, significant weight loss specific to the face is often a sign of <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> or malnutrition, not healthy dieting.  On average, as fat stores are burned off, weight loss is noticed first where most of the weight was kept (i.e. the stomach area in men).  You may be losing some fat stores in your face, but its hard to notice since you see yourself everyday.

The best types of diets are balanced.  Stay away from processed sugars, fast food, and highly salted foods.  This along with regular cardiovascular exercise is likely to give good results in the long run.  Remember that maintaining a healthy BMI is important for every aspect of your health.  Please keep plugging away and don't get discouraged.  Your hard work will pay off in the end.  "
What can cause fatigue with testing positive for Epstein-Barr Virus?,"I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling so badly! This is something you should definitely discuss with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a>. It sounds like the testing that you had for Epstein Barr virus six months ago may have been consistent with a relatively recent Epstein Barr virus infection, especially given the positive EBV early antigen (EA-D) test, which typically is found in the blood shortly after an infection and then goes away over time. The other two tests (EBV VCA and nuclear antigen) persist in the bloodstream for life after an EBV infection, and so they could not help you distinguish between a recent and very remote infection. 

If this was an acute EBV infection, then it is certainly true that the fatigue associated with the infection can persist for several months after the infection, even after all of the other symptoms have resolved. That being said, 6 months is quite a while to be feeling fatigued after an EBV infection, and so your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> will probably want to consider other potential causes of your fatigue, such as depression, problems with your thyroid function, or <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>. Start by going to the followup appointment, as you are already planning to do, and I'm sure that together you will be able to come up with an acceptable plan for further workup. "
"""What should I do if my son has hand, foot and mouth illness?""","This is something you should definitely discuss with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a>. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>, especially among young children. As the name suggests, there are often symptoms involving the hands and feet (including redness and some blistering among other things), and also the mouth, with the same blisters and redness. It can be extremely concerning and distressing for both the patient and his or her parents, as it makes it difficult to eat or drink, and also is often associated with moderately high <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. In this setting, there is usually some degree of irritability or fatigue, with the entire picture being one of a very sick child. Especially for parents who have never experienced or do not remember the effects of this illness, it can be disconcerting. The good news is that it usually will resolve all by itself in just a few days, and the only thing that needs to be done is to manage the symptoms as they arise. Encourage hydration, manage temperatures and discomfort with over the counter analgesia (if appropriate), and wait for the illness to pass. As it is often spread in waves, it is possible your child may have some sick contacts who are already over it. If you are concerned that your child has this illness, please speak with your doctor."
What is the danger of measles to me when pregnant?,"Measles can be a very significant problem when you are pregnant, as it is a disease that can be severe in adults that are susceptible. If you have concerns about having been exposed, please speak with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> so that you can be appropriately screened and treated if necessary. We are fortunate in the United States to have a wide spread vaccination program that has helped most of the school aged children to be vaccinated. What many people don't remember is the broad and life threatening complications that occurred before vaccinations were so common, and you are now, unfortunately, having to dig into what some of those are. If you have been vaccinated yourself, then your risk of becoming infected is much lower. Depending on your exposure history (and the amount of contact that you have had with the person that is infected), your doctor may choose to do some tests to determine if you are immune to rubeola, or measles. Unlike rubella (German Measles), rubeola is not associated with birth defects, and so it is primarily for your own health and well being that you should be seen by your doctor. Obviously, your health affects that of your unborn child very much.   Again, please speak with your doctor as needed."
Should I request further urinalysis/testing?,"This is an issue that you should raise with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a>. The possibility of acquiring a sexually transmitted disease can be very worrisome.  Furthermore, any unprotected sex does place you at risk of acquiring an <a href=""/procedure/std-sexually-transmitted-disease-150"">STD</a>, although it would be somewhat more unusual to present with this diagnosis many months later.  However, diagnosing STDs in men can be more difficult than in women because men are often asymptomatic for much longer periods than women, even if they do have an infection.  For your own peace of mind, it would not be medically contraindicated to have specific testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia, since these would be the most likely infections to cause penile discharge and itching.  This testing is very easily done from either a simple urethral swab or a urine test.  In addition, if your symptoms were due to a yeast infection, they should have improved with the fluconazole.  If they have not, you should let your doctor know.  Overall, safe sexual practices and regular health screening are always appropriate.  Your concern is valid, given your history of unprotected sex, since even one encounter can lead to an infection.  In this situation, the best thing you can do is make sure to always use protection when sexually active, and continue to have regular appointments with your physician to discuss your concerns and consider additional testing. Again, please talk to your doctor."
"Eight days of fever, fatigue, headache, stiff neck, and body aches. Is it time to go to the ER??","I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling so badly and not experiencing much improvement even 8 days out now. It is definitely the case that viral infections commonly cause symptoms like this, and those symptoms can go on for quite a while, definitely more than 1 week. However, if you are feeling more and more fatigued and not having any relief, then it is definitely time to check in with a <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> again. 

Of all the symptoms that you mention, I am most concerned by the <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a> and the stiff neck, because these could be symptoms of meningitis, which can be a serious medical problem. If the headache and stiffness are severe, especially if you have other symptoms such as dizziness, sensitivity to light, or nausea, then a trip to the emergency room is definitely in order. In the emergency room, they will probably want to do a spinal tap to look at the fluid in your spinal column and make sure that you do not have meningitis. 

On the other hand if the headache and stiffness are mild and more like a general sensation of fatigue, then you might just be able to contact your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> and get in tomorrow for an urgent care visit. "
Does this sound like meningitis or something else?,"I would definitely go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> right away about these symptoms. If you can't get in to see your primary care doctor at an urgent care appointment today, going to the emergency room for quicker evaluation would be very appropriate. 

I think you are right to worry about meningitis. Meningitis is characterized by severe <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, and neck stiffness. It sounds like you have all of these symptoms, so ruling out meningitis is of utmost important. If your doctor, after an examination, agrees that this could be meningitis, then you will need a spinal tap to rule it out. 

There are also other things that could cause these symptoms. For example, a really bad flu or other viral infection could cause all of these same symptoms. Similarly, a strep throat infection could cause these symptoms. Finally, it could be that you are having a bad migraine!

Nevertheless, you are right that the first step is to seek an evaluation by a doctor right away. Based on what your doctor finds, they will be able to help you figure out what treatment is needed, and hopefully you will be feeling better soon. 

Contact your doctor right now!"
Is two weeks too early to be tested for HIV if you are showing some symptoms?,"Acute infection with HIV can present in a variety of ways, some of which can resemble the flu. Many people will develop fevers, malaise, <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, joint and muscle aches, and <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>. Some will develop a concurrent rash, which can be in many different forms and distributions. The physical exam in acute HIV may reveal enlargement of lymph nodes throughout the body. 

Fortunately, there are accurate tests that can be used to differentiate these two different illnesses. For the flu, swabs obtained from the back of the throat (through the nose) can be used to detect the presence of the virus. For HIV, it generally takes a few weeks to months to detect the antibody in the patient's blood that is produced in response to transmission of the virus. However, within just 1-2 weeks after infection, it is possible to detect the actual viral particles through the use of different blood tests. If there is suspicion of HIV infection and initial testing returns negative, the test can be repeated at a later date to confirm the result. 

It is strongly advised that you seek out the care of your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss the symptoms that you are experiencing. With the use of a thorough medical history, physical exam, and testing, you should be able to get to the bottom of your symptoms and start the appropriate treatment. "
How long is a fever supposed to last?,"I would recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a quick evaluation. Although you are right that many times a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> is not necessarily a serious problem, since it has been going on now for three days, it would be worth while making certain. 

A fever is part of the body's natural response to an infection. A low grade fever is common with most viral infections, like the flu or the common cold. However, a fever may also be a sign of a more serious illness, such as a bacteria infection like a <a href=""/procedure/pneumonia-214"">pneumonia</a>. In adults in particular, it is not common for the fever from a common viral infection to last more than a day or two, which is why making sure you do not have a worse infection settling in is important. 

Your doctor can perform a thorough examination, looking for evidence of a worse infection. If they find anything concerning, they may want additional tests, such a blood or urine tests or an x-ray of the lungs. Based on these studies, they will be able to recommend a treatment, if one is necessary. 

I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Why am I getting random fevers?,"First of all, your question already contains the answer to the most important first step forward. You have first to document your temperature while you are feeling hot, which you can do with a simple drug store thermometer. This is critical, because if you 'feel hot' but do not have an actual elevation in your temperature, then this is not a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, and the list of potential medical causes is much different then if you do have a real temperature elevation. 

Once you have performed this simple home data collection step, you should be able to schedule another appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to address the issue again. 

In the absence of fever, there are several potential causes of feeling warm. In women, one very common cause is 'hot flashes"" which usually start to occur in middle age and represent the beginnings of menopause. In both men and women, another cause would be hyperthyroidism, caused by over activity of the thyroid gland. If, on the other hand, you do have a documented fever, then the list of causes is numerous, and includes various infections, as well as rheumatologic (joint) conditions and cancer. 

In either case, your doctor will want to perform a thorough examination and some basic bloodwork to get started. Please discuss with him or her soon!"
What is blood poisoning?,"A blood infection is when infection from another part of the body spreads into the blood. This is very serious, obviously, because it can then travel to any other part of the body. If it travels to other parts of the body, it can ""grab on"" to certain areas of the body (such as some of the heart valves) that have been traumatized or are damaged and can ""seed"" these areas with bacteria. Should this happen, there is then a concern that the bacteria can create a ""biofilm"" which can then make them almost completely resistant to antibiotics by forming a barrier over the surface. In some rare cases, the only intervention that can be completed at that time is complete surgical removal of the affected area. Obviously, that is a much bigger deal than just treating a muscle infection with some antibiotics, and describes the reason that <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctors</a> are often very aggressive at treating things that may seem small to patients. All of those long, sleepless years of training with little pay in large hospitals help doctors to see just how bad things can rarely get, and help us to do everything we can to keep our patients away from those complications. Please continue to follow up with your doctor as advised. "
Can stress cause shingles?,"Shingles, or herpes zoster, as it is called by doctors, is an interesting disease. There is a bit of truth in both answers that you propose in your question. First, most of us ""catch"" the virus that causes shingles when we are young. It is best known as ""chicken pox."" While the acute <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> eventually goes away, the virus itself relaxes in our body for decades, waiting for a chance to break out again. It lives in the nerves themselves, which explains the pattern of the itch and rash when it does come back (which is called by doctors a ""dermatomal distribution""). While it is there dormant, your body is able to suppress it due to the normally healthy immune system. When something comes along that makes the immune system less effective, the virus has a chance to express itself again. Stress, other illnesses, and chronic steroid use can all pre-dispose people to developing manifestations of the virus. There is a shot that has been FDA approved to prevent shingles, but it is only approved in those over the age of 65. Please speak with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> about your questions, and see if the shot may be right for you. "
Could I have glandular fever?,"Glandular <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, also more commonly known as infectious mononucleosis or just 'mono' for short, is a viral infection caused by the Epstein Barr virus. The condition is very common; most people have been infected by the virus by the time they reach adulthood! Typically, the virus infects older children or teenagers, and the symptoms include <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, swollen glands in the neck, fever, and fatigue. The infection is contagious, and the virus tends to be spread from person to person through saliva and respiratory secretions. Therefore it is also sometimes called the 'kissing disease.'

The time from when you are exposed to the virus in the saliva of another person until the time that you could potentially develop the symptoms is called the 'incubation period.' In the case of infectious mononucleosis, the incubation period is typically more than 1 month. For this reason, it is unlikely that your cough right now is the result of infectious mononucleosis, as you were exposed only 1 week ago. 

Nevertheless, I think it would be prudent to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for a checkup and more advice. There are several other potential causes of your cough that can be investigated and, if necessary, treated. See your doctor today!"
Do antibiotics cure Leptospirosis or do they just treat it?,"Leptospirosis is an unusual infection that is caused by the Leptospira bacteria. It is fairly rare in the United States, with most cases occurring in those who are exposed to certain wild animals or who come into contact with water that has been contaminated by wild animals infected with the bacteria. 

The condition is often very difficult to diagnose, because it has a large number of vague symptoms, like muscle aches and pains, <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, and <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. Also, since it is rare, it is not at the top of the list for most <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctors</a> when they see a patient with these symptoms. 

Most cases of leptospirosis are actually self limited and get better on their own without any treatment at all (probably most cases are not even diagnosed). However, if you are diagnosed with leptospirosis, there is benefit to taking antibiotics, as these will help you get better more quickly. In most cases, you can expect to make a full recover from Leptospirosis with cure of the infection. 

If you or someone you know has recently been diagnosed with Leptospirosis, then you should definitely work closely with the hospital physicians or infectious disease doctors who are managing the case. They will be able to answer all of your specific questions!"
How do you get a fever to go away?,"<a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">Fever</a> is a very basic sign that your body is trying to fight something off. Fever alone, especially if it is mild, is not necessarily worrisome because it means your body is doing its job! Therefore, most of the time, fever is simply treated with a fever-lowering medicine like aspirin or tylenol, and the infection is allowed to run its course. 

However, since you have now had fever for two days continually, which is not responding to a fever-lowering medicine, you should probably go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> for an evaluation. High fevers that are resistant to fever lowering medications and that persist for several days are sometimes a sign of a more serious infection requiring medical treatment. 

Make sure to tell your doctor what other symptoms you are experiencing, such as cough, <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, ear pain, rash, urinary symptoms, or abdominal pain, as these symptoms will help your doctor as they try to narrow down the potential causes of your fever. In addition to a physical examination, your doctor may decide to do other testing, such as basic blood work, if there is any concern for a serious infection. Also, based on what they find, they will be able to determine whether you need treatment, such as with antibiotics. "
Why do I feel cold even though I am sweating?,"It sounds like you may have a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>! Fever causes both sweating and cold with chills. This is because, when you have a fever, the body temperature tends to rise and fall around the fever every few hours. When the body temperature is rising, you will perceive this as being cold and having chills (in fact, your brain is making your muscles shiver to help raise the body temperature). Then, when the temperature is falling, the sweat glands and blood vessels in your skin open up to release the excess heat, leading to sweating. 

I think you should go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. Fever should not continue for two weeks, and so it is necessary to get a thorough checkup and see if together you can figure out why you are having symptoms of fever and what needs to be done about it. 

Make sure to mention to your doctor if you  have any other symptoms that might point towards potential sources of the fever - such as headache, sore throat, sore muscles, swollen joints, <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, cough, weight loss, changes in your bowel movements, or pain with urination. These symptoms will help them narrow down the potential causes of your fever. "
is there a vaccine for Lyme disease?,"Some years ago, there was a vaccine for Lyme disease that was available. However, it dd not cause lasting protection from the disease, and the vaccine was discontinued due to general lack of demand for the vaccine. 

Nevertheless, there are plenty of things you can do to protect yourself from getting Lyme disease. First of all, when you are outdoors, especially when you are walking through the woods or through tall grass, you should wear protective clothing to prevent coming into contact with ticks. Also when you return indoors, you should thoroughly check yourself over, paying attention to areas like the waist line, groin, armpits, and sock line, where ticks tend to end up. 

If you do find a tick, you should seek attention from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. If you do develop any evidence of early Lyme disease, such as a red spreading ring around the site of the tick bite, you will need to take antibiotics to clear up the infection. Fortunately, when the infection is caught early, it is very easy to treat with these antibiotics and there are no lasting effects. 

Please talk to your doctor for more information!"
Are these the symptoms of a tick bite?,"You definitely need to go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible, because this redness around the bite could be a condition that needs to be treated. 

In particular, in many areas of the United States now, ticks transmit a condition known as Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by bacteria which live in the saliva of the ticks and pass into the blood stream of a human after a tick bite. The first signs of Lyme disease are a spreading circular area of redness around the tick bite, which is sometimes accompanied by vague general symptoms like fevers, fatigue, or <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>. Fortunately, if this is what you have, it is easily diagnosed by your doctor and it is easy to treat with simple antibiotics. It is important not to wait, because Lyme disease becomes more difficult to treat later on. 

Another possibility, other than Lyme disease, is that this area of redness is simply a skin infection at the site of the tick bite. Nevertheless, that should also be evaluated by your doctor to make sure that you do not need to take antibiotics for that infection. 

Get in to see your primary care doctor right away!"
How long is mono contagious?,"As you probably know, mono, or ""infectious mononucleosis,"" is a common viral infection which typically occurs in teenagers and young adults. Symptoms include <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, swollen glands in the neck, and fatigue. Most of the time, the condition is not serious, however symptoms can linger for a long time and can result in trouble keeping up with work or school obligations. However, it sounds like your symptoms have improved, and I am glad you are feeling better!

Unfortunately, it is hard to predict when you are no longer contagious. Most people are actually capable of transmitting the virus even before they develop symptoms (this is called the 'incubation period', and viral shedding may also continue for many weeks to months after the symptoms go away (with slowly decreasing contagiousness over time). Therefore, although the fact that your symptoms are better is a good sign, since the peak of being contagious does correlate with the the time before and during the worst symptoms, this does not absolutely mean that you are no longer contagious. 

I recommend that you pose this question to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, who can give you a more definitive answer. Good luck!"
What can I do now that my proteus infection has cleared up?,"Proteus is a very common bacterial infection, and it is usually responsible for urinary tract infections. Proteus can infect other parts of the body as well, but that is more rare. Therefore, I assume that what you had was a Proteus infection in the urine. 

If this is not the case, and the infection was somewhere else (for example, in the bloodstream), then there might be longer term health complications or followup that you would need. You would have to talk to the <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> who treated the infection however, or to an <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a>, to get the specifics, as any complications would be related to the part of your body that was infected. 

Then is something that you should talk to your doctor about, as sometimes regular antibiotics or other treatments are needed to prevent recurrence. Good luck. "
Did I get Chagas disease from an insect bite?,"Chagas disease, as you have probably read by now on the internet, is a parasitic disease that is caused by a biting insect. It is found in South America but, because of eradication campaigns, it is decreasing in frequency and is really mostly encountered only in rural South America in substandard housing. Therefore, if you were mostly traveling in cities or staying in hotels, the chance that this is Chagas disease is very remote. 

If you are concerned about Chagas disease still, based on what kind of traveling you were doing, then there are specialized tests that can be done to rule the infection out; this is something you would need to talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or a travel medicine doctor about. 

More importantly, it does sound like you sustained an insect bite of some kind which is now likely infected, based on the fact that it has a spreading area of redness around it. I would get in to see your primary care doctor or an emergency room about this right away, as, based on what the bite looks like, you may need to take some antibiotics to help clear up the infection. "
How does a person get Lyme disease?,"Lyme disease, as you may have read online, is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through bites by certain ticks. Lyme disease is very common in certain parts of the United States. For example, in the Northeast the ticks that carry Lyme disease are found everywhere, even in urban areas like parks and greenways. Therefore, if you live in an area where Lyme disease is common, it is easy to get infected; since the ticks are small, you may not even recall having been bitten. 

Typically the early symptoms of Lyme disease are a spreading red ring on the skin around the tick bite. In a certain percentage of people, if the condition is not caught and treated at this stage, it can go on to cause body-wide symptoms, such as joint pains and swelling. 

If you are having worrisome symptoms, it is important to go see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> right away. If this is Lyme disease, it can be diagnosed with some simple blood tests and treated with antibiotics. Importantly, there are many other conditions which can cause similar symptoms, and for this reason it is important to have a full check up. 

Go see your doctor as soon as possible!"
How long should a fever typically last?,"Yes, something definitely could be wrong if you think you have a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> and it has been persistent for over a week. Definitely a fever may last for different durations depending on the clinical situation, and may not resolve itself if the cause is serious. A fever is generally a manifestation of systemic inflammation. If there is persistent inflammation for a variety of possible reasons, you may continue to have a fever. There is no fixed time for how long a fever should last. 
It also depends as to what your symptoms are and what you define as a fever. A fever of 100.4 is generally what is considered significant, and depending on your symptoms maybe due to a virus, a bacterial infection, drug related. 
It is of the utmost importance that you make an appointment to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to discuss your situation. Your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> will be able to ask you questions about your clinical picture in depth, perform a detailed physical exam, order necessary lab tests to check for inflammatory changes and for other alarming values. Depending on these results, your doctor will be able to treat you appropriately, possibly with antibiotics or with other therapy. "
Can a MRSA infection be fatal?,"Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA is a special type of bacteria that frequently is found on the skin and in the noses of many people.  MRSA gets its name from its ability to survive a specific antibiotic that was used to treat Staphylococcus aureus for many years.  There are a number of distinctions that we should make.  First, there is a difference between being infected with MRSA and being colonized.  MRSA infections can come in many forms from skin and soft tissue infections to infections of the blood and heart valves.  Infections can be dangerous, whereas MRSA colonization means that the bacteria lives on the skin without causing any symptoms.  Unfortunately, being colonized may make it more likely to eventually develop an infection, especially if you undergo <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> or another medical procedure.

The good news is that most MRSA infections are almost never fatal.  While many strains of MRSA are resistant to more than one antibiotic, there are usually other acceptable antibiotic options to treat the infection including many common ones such as Bactrim or doxycycline.  Colonization can also be treated by undergoing a decolonization procedure which involves an antiseptic soap such a chlorhexidine and a nasal ointment called mupiricin. You should contact your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> who can discuss this more thoroughly and help direct you to the appropriate therapy.  Good luck!"
How does meningitis spread?,"Meningitis is an infection of the lining that covers the brain.  It can be a very dangerous condition, especially if it is not diagnosed and treated early.  There are many causes of meningitis including several bacteria  such as two strains of Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilius influenzae and viruses such as a group of enteroviruses, herpes viruses, and HIV among many others.  The bacteria that cause meningitis travel through the blood to reach the covering of the brain and infect it.  Unfortunately, many of the bacteria that cause meningitis colonize the nose and throat and as your concern points out are transmitted through respiratory droplets.  Viral meningitis can be transmitted in much the same way, though it is also spread by fecal-oral routes and insect bites.

Luckily, only family members and contacts working within approximately three feet of those who have meningitis are considered to be at high risk.  If you do work in close contact with your colleague who was diagnosed with meningitis there is effective antibacterial prophylaxis for some forms.  Contact your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> for who can help you get the right treatment.  Also, you should contact your primary care physician or go to the Emergency Room if you develop <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, rash or other concerning symptoms.  Good luck!"
What causes boils on the skin?,"Boils in the skin are a relatively common occurrence that many people get at one time or another. That being said, recurrent boils are not normal and should be evaluated. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. If necessary, he or she may refer you an <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a> or a skin specialist (a <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a>) who can better help you with this.

A boil (also known as a furuncle) is a infection of the skin. The infection is often (if not always) centered around a hair follicle and involves the clogging of the hair pores. The infection forms a ball on the skin -- inside which the bacteria grow -- and thus gives the boil its characteristic appearance.

A boil can happen randomly for many people. However, if someone is getting recurrent boils -- this may be a sign of a underlying problem. The first thing to consider is if you have poor skin hygiene that could be contributing. There should also be an evaluation of if there is poor circulation to the skin that contributes to the infection. There should also  be an evaluation if there is a disorder with your body's ability to fight infection -- the most common of which is diabetes mellitus. 

Good hygiene is the first step, but please also talk to your doctor for more information. Good luck!"
Does a fever mean that you have an infection?,"A <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> occurs when the body temperature is elevated to 100.4 degree F or higher.  However, the degree of a fever does not necessarily indicate how sick a person is.  It happens when something is wrong, usually an infection within the body, and the hypothalamus of the brain increases the body's temperature to fight against infections.  (It is also normal for a fever of up to 100.4 degree F to occur after strenuous exercise or heat exhaustion).  That said, a fever is an important part of your body's defense against infection and inflammation.  Most bacteria and viruses thrive best at the normal body temperature of 98.6 degree F.  When they invade your body, causing infections, your body's defense mechanism is to raise its normal temperature in an attempt to kill off the bacteria and viruses.  In short, the fever is fighting the battle that might be going on in your body for you, not against.  Although it is rarely harmful, brain damage from a fever may occur if it is over 107.6 degree F so prompt medical care is essential in this emergency situation.  Fever is also a symptom caused by a variety of illnesses that it is good idea to schedule a visit with a <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> or an <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a> to rule out any serious condition.  "
How do you get a MRSA infection?,"MRSA is a pathogenic bacteria that can infect humans. MRSA is an acronym that stands for Methicillin Resistent Staphylococcus Aureus. There are many different types of bacteria out there, and they are classified in many different ways. In very basic terms, one way to classify bacterial is by whether it is gram stain positive, or negative (aka gram positive, or gram neg). This has to do with the make-up of the cell wall of the bacteria. MRSA is gram positive. Gram positive bacteria can be further classified by their shape. Bacillus is the shape of a pill capsule, cocci are spherical, spirochetes are cork-screw shaped. MRSA is a cocci. Cocci can be staph (like a cluster of grapes) or strep (like a string of pearls). MRSA is a ""staph""ylococcus. In a hospital setting, when bacteria from a patient is cultured to identify it, it is tested with multiple different antibiotics to see what kills it the best (this is called its ""sensitivity""). Thus methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) is resistant to the antibiotic methicillin (which is in the penicillin family). Like most bacterial infections, MRSA is transmitted through close contact. This is why nation wide there has been a large quality control push to encourage hand washing within hospitals to help prevent the spread of infections from one patient to another. She may be at increased risk of exposure to the bacteria due to her job, but that doesn't mean that she will necessarily get infected from it. All the more reason to be diligent about hand washing. If she has more questions about MRSA and the spread of infection, or if she thinks that she may be infected, I would recommend making an appointment with her <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>, or an <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a>. I hope that this information is helpful. "
Does a tetanus shot cause a lot of pain?,"Tetanus shots are a relatively common procedure. To answer your question -- no, a tetanus shot should not hurt a significant amount. While it does involve a needle and breaking of the skin, it is a relatively well tolerated procedure.

A tetanus shot is an important immunization. The shot gives you an exposure to a small, dead version of the tetanus virus -- which allows your immune system to see it and therefore prepare its defenses. Thereby, the next time you are exposed to the tetanus virus (often though a open cut like from a nail or from a railing), then you can fight it off. Tetanus is a horrible disease that causes spasm of the muscles (all your muscles contract and you can't move) so preventing it is key. Often, the same shot includes immunization for diptheria and pertussis -- two other very damaging diseases.

The pain itself is minimal. It is a small needle often given into the meaty part of the arm. There can be a small amount of soreness for 1-2 days (similar to the sensation if you worked out too hard). Rarely, people get a low grade <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. Otherwise, outside of a very rare allergic reaction, it is well tolerated.

Good luck!"
Can I get an infection if I scratch my mosquito bite?,"If you have a bite or any other concerning skin infection that appears to not be healing, you should speak to your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a>. While mosquito bites can often be red and angry for a short period of time, and can then be exacerbated the the scratching that is done to relieve the itch, if the site is getting worse or persists, please speak with your doctor. This could be a sign that the initial small wound from the break in the skin caused by the mosquito has become secondarily infected. As there are many bacteria that generally live on our skin, just waiting for a chance to get in, this is easy to have happen. Some of the first signs are redness, swelling, and pain, which are then followed by <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, chills, and other signs that there may be a bacteria that is invading and causing problems for your entire body. In this day and age of antibiotic resistant bacteria, there is the additional fear that any infection may be caused by a resistant bug such as MRSA, which require powerful antibiotics (and, occasionally, surgical drainage) to heal completely. Please see your doctor if your wound is getting worse or has not healed. "
Is my belly button infected?,"Foul odors can often be a sign of an infection, but just because you have a foul smell does not mean that the bacteria or fungus that are making the smell have actually invaded your body (which would be an infection). Some signs of an infection would include redness, swelling, and pain or tenderness. As an infection progresses, you might also start to develop a <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> and other, more wide spread symptoms. Given the dark, moist folds of your umbilical region, they are perfect places for both bacteria and fungi to grow unless they are cleaned carefully and regularly. Even so, those who are immunosuppressed, obese, or have other medical issues can be pre-disposed to developing infections in these sites.  If you are worried that you might have an infection, you can clean the area gently with a mild skin soap, water, or even a diluted concentration of other skin cleansing anti-bacterial products. Be careful not to irritate the skin with cleaning. The most important thing with any skin infection (or concern for an infection) is to make sure that you visit with your <a href=""/family-physicians"">family physician</a> about anything that is either getting worse or refuses to get better over a period of time. "
Why do people with HIV develop thrush?,"Thrush is an infection of the mouth with the a fungus called Candida.  This is the type of fungus that can cause yeast infections of the skin, mouth, and vagina.  This overgrowth of fungi occur when the immune system is weakened.  In the case of your partner, his infection with HIV has most likely weakened his immune system to the point where he develops thrush.  Thrush is one of the first signs of a weak immune system and can occur with only mild reductions in the T-cells which are effected by HIV.  This is why so many HIV positive people get thrush.

Treatment of thrush is simple, but preventing it from occurring in the future is a bit more complicated.  The first question that I would have is if your partner is on the correct anti-retroviral medications.  The medications for HIV today are excellent and can keep the virus at bay for many years.  Perhaps these medications need optimized.  Thrush can be treated with oral anti-fungal medication.  

I suggest that your partner schedule an appointment with his <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a>.  This is the <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> that he sees for his HIV.  The two of them can discuss this symptom of a weakened immune system and come up with a plan to combat it.  Good luck.  "
Can I build up a resistance to mono?,"Mononucleosis is a disease which many people get. It is thought that most of these are caused by a virus. In most cases, it is rare for people to get mono twice, but this is possible. Talk to your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> if you have specific health concerns that apply to yourself.

Mononucleosis is also known as mono and also known as ""the kissing disease."" The reason it is called the kissing disease is that it is caused by a virus which is often transmitted by saliva. Teenagers often get this as they start this social interaction -- but this is not always the case. Most often, mononucleosis is caused by the Epstein Barr Virus -- or EBV. 

This causes the symptoms of <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, fatigue, and overall decreased energy that we associate with mono. Our body develops immunity against a virus once it sees it. Therefore, getting EBV mononucleosis a second time is very unlikely, because your body (if working normally) should be able to fight it off a second time around.

That being said, people rarely get mono twice. This is because other viruses (like CMV, a cousin of EBV) can also cause a similar <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a>. Also people who have not perfect immune systems can not fight the infection appropriately.

Talk to your doctor for more information."
Should I get a swine flu shot if I'm traveling to a country with high instances of swine flu?,"Although swine flu has potential to contribute to a worldwide influenza pandemic, avian influenza is more common.  Egypt has had several reported cases of avian flu during recent months, and you are wise to consider this infection prior to traveling.  The current CDC and WHO guidelines are to get a seasonal influenza vaccine prior to travel (it incorporates the most common strands found during each flu season).  You should also avoid poultry farms, wild birds, dead birds, bird fluids/droppings, bird markets, and poultry/eggs that have not been completely cooked.  Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or alcohol-based sanitizer.  Cover your mouth with a tissue or your upper arm when you sneeze or cough.

If you develop symptoms of influenza, such as fevers, cough, shortness of breath, or muscle pains, then you should see a <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> or call the US embassy quickly to see if you would benefit from antiviral therapy.  

And of course, it is always a good idea to be evaluated by a <a href=""/travel-medicine-specialists"">travel medicine specialist</a> prior to travel to determine what other vaccines and prophylactic medications may be recommended.
"
What is the swelling in my neck?,"Lymph nodes are part of the body's immune system.  When an infection occurs, the bacteria or viruses are brought from the surface by specialized immune cells to the lymph nodes where they are presented to white blood cells.  These white blood cells then start to divide and multiply and release a number of inflammatory factors which make the body a hostile environment for bacteria and viruses.  

The division and multiplication as well as the inflammation lead to swelling of these lymph nodes which can become very tender.  Often this will predominantly occur in one lymph node, specifically the one nearest where the offending organism has invaded the body, because specific nodes act as drainage basins for specific areas of the body.  The lymph nodes of the neck drain the mouth and nose areas, thus in an upper respiratory infection like a common head cold, these nodes often become swollen.  The typical treatment is simply to give your body time to fight the infection.  Once it is over, your neck will go back to normal.

Another possibility is that your painful swelling is due to an inflamed salivary gland.  The principle is fairly similar.  These glands are typically under the jaw or to the sides of your face.  Regardless of where the swelling is, you should talk to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> to make sure that there is nothing more serious going on, such as an <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a> that has formed due to your infection.  If so, you would need to be on antibiotics and likely require drainage of the fluid collection."
Is a staph infection considered a severe infection?,"Staph infections are among the most common infections, and generally respond very well to treatment, although they sometimes require a simple procedure to remove the local infection. Unfortunately, over use of common antibiotics and failing to complete treatment regimens as directed have led to strains of bacteria that are resistant to the majority of antibiotics commonly used. 

You may have heard of MRSA, which is one example of this resistance that can be very dangerous. Because testing for this particular resistant strain of bacteria requires further testing, doctors are generally very cautious with any skin infection until all of the test results are back. Failure to completely treat this infection can result in the bacteria going to other parts of your body, such as your bones or even your heart, which can then require <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a> to remove the infection, followed by long courses of intravenous antibiotics that often require indwelling intravenous lines. While this scenario is not common, it is certainly possible when an infection is not treated completely. 

If you are concerned about not taking time off during the work week, please speak with your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> about scheduling, but don't avoid treating this infection as it can become very serious. Please speak with your doctor about your concerns.  "
How can I reduce the risks of getting or spreading antibiotic-resistant infections when I visit hospital patients?,"The risk of passing antibiotic resistant infections is difficult. In fact this is a question that many infectious control experts are working on diligently. I would talk to your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> regarding specific details with respect to your health and your specific risks.

There are many type of super bugs. One of the most common that you mention is MRSA or methicillin resistant staph aureus. Staph aureus is a type of bug, and methicillin resistant means that it is resistant to methicillin (a type of penicillin). By implication if it is resistant to methicillin it is resistant to many of the bugs. This specific infection is not air borne. This is passed through contact. It can also live on other objects, so touching an object (like a bed or chair) that the infected person has touched might transmit it. Hand washing is key to preventing transmission. If you are going form room to room it is probably worthwhile to wear a protective gown and gloves to protect your clothing (these should be available as the <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctors</a> and nurses will wear them before entering hte room). The bug will likely not infect you, but simply live on your skin (colonize your skin) and therefore giving blood should not be a problem. 

There are many other infections - some of which are airborne, like the flu. Some like in water, but not all.

Talk to your doctor. If you have specific medical conditions this could change your exposure risks."
Does the Rapid HIV test look for antibodies?,"You are correct that the antibody test for HIV takes months to become positive.  Unfortunately, the rapid HIV test is just a faster method of detecting those antibodies.  So while the result so the test will come back faster, you can't have the test done any sooner.

Since you were possibly exposed to HIV 4 weeks ago, you are nearing the end of the window where you can develop the acute retroviral syndrome.  This is an illness that 90% of people that received the virus will get between 2 weeks and a month after exposure.  Symptoms include <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>, night sweats, enlarged lymph nodes, <a href=""/procedure/sore-throat-466"">sore throat</a>, muscle aches, a rash, and several other episodes.  People who get the acute retroviral syndrome often say they thought they caught the flu.  While the absence of these symptoms does not rule out HIV transmission, it does reduce the likelihood that you did get it.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can take a detailed history of any symptoms you may have and perform a physical exam, focusing on the possible findings of the acute retroviral syndrome.  The two of you can also discuss measures you can take to protect yourself against HIV.  In a couple months, you can have the HIV antibody test.  Good luck.  "
What is intestinal TB?,"Tuberculosis is a very common bacterial infection, especially in developing countries, and it can cause many symptoms, include intestinal symptoms. Tuberculosis is quite contagious, and it requires immediate medical evaluation and treatment.   Most commonly, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis infects the lungs, causing chronic cough, weight loss, and other symptoms. However sometimes it can cause what is called 'extra-pulmonary' (outside the lungs) tuberculosis, infecting lymph nodes and other organs, such as the intestines. Intestinal tuberculosis is especially common in the developing world. Often intestinal tuberculosis may have no symptoms, or it may present with <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>, cramping, and weight loss. Often people who have intestinal tuberculosis also have other sites of tuberculosis infection, such as in the lungs.  It is very important that your son be evaluated by an infectious disease <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> or his <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>, or whatever other qualified physician is available wherever he is living. In addition to beginning treatment for tuberculosis, which usually requires taking several drugs at the same time for many month, he may also need to be evaluated for medical conditions that may have put him at higher risk of contracting tuberculosis, such as infection with the HIV virus. "
Is seborrheic dermatitis a symptom of HIV?,"The first, and most important, point is that HIV is a very serious infection that has significant life threatening health consequences if not detected and treated but that can be well managed if diagnosed and if medications are regularly taken.   Therefore it is absolutely critical, if you have any concerns whatsoever about a potential HIV exposure or infection, that you get tested as soon as possible. Testing is simple and available readily from your <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">doctor</a> and is the first step in ensuring your continued health and long life.   To answer your question, there are many, many skin conditions related to HIV infection. These include seborrheic dermatitis; in fact virtually all people with HIV infections get seborrheic dermatitis in the later stages of the infection. The are also predisposed to skin infections and skin cancers.   As always the diagnosis and the management of your particular condition will require testing for HIV and a visit with your doctor. Setting up a visit with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as soon as possible is highly recommended. "
How are white blood cells and HIV related?,"HIV attacks a specific subtype of white blood cells, the CD4 T cells.  There are several different types of white blood cells, each of which is responsible for fighting specific types of infections (for example, viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasitic, etc.).   CD4 T cells help the other types of white blood cells fight infection.  

When HIV infects a cell, it can survive there for many years, protected from antiviral medications.  It slowly replicates, and its offspring infect other cells.  Eventually, the virus takes over all of the cell functions in order to make more viral particles, leading to cell death.  Without CD4 T cells, the other white blood cells cannot work as well even if they are present in sufficient numbers, leading to the serious infections that characterize AIDS.

Antiviral medications prevent the virus from replicating and infecting new cells.  <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">Doctors</a> monitor patients' CD4 white blood cell count and HIV viral load to determine when they will benefit from starting medications.  It is very important that you see your doctor regularly as you learn more about HIV infection.  Working with your doctor to stay informed about your health and adhering to the therapeutic plan is more important than targeting a specific white blood cell count."
Child's pupil size varies constantly. Is this a problem?,"The normal function of the eye pupil is that it dilates in response to low light situations. This allows more light to enter the eye and helps with visual acuity in dark environments. If you notice that your son's pupils dilate mostly in this setting, then there is probably nothing wrong. 

However, this is definitely an issue that you should mention to your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. Sometimes, pupil irregularities can be a sign of a serious medical problem, either a problem within the eye itself, or a problem with the neurological symptom. This is especially the case if the issue affects only one eye, rather than both eyes, raising the chance that this might be a medical problem. 

Your pediatrician will begin by examining your son's eyes closely. First, they will want to check for visual acuity, to make sure that your son's vision is basically normal. They will also look for any evidence of inflammation in the eye, cataracts, tumors, or other causes within the eye itself. Finally, they will perform a neurological examination, to make sure that there are no warning signs. 

Based on what they find, they may want to refer your son to an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for a more complete eye examination. Good luck!"
Why is my vision blurry in my left eye?,"There are a number of different causes for blurry vision, and I would definitely suggest touching base again with your <a href=""/optometrists"">doctor</a>. It would probably be best to get a formal eye examination by an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> in order to help pin down what might be going on. 

There are several different causes of blurry vision, some serious and some not. For example, intermittent blurry vision can occur with fatigue or eye strain. It may also be caused by seasonal eye allergies (which can also cause some swelling of the eyelids). Similarly, a small scratch on the surface of the eye (known as the cornea) can also cause blurry vision, but this tends to be quite uncomfortable as well. 

There are also more serious causes of blurry vision, which can include deeper inflammations or infections in the eye. It may also be caused by a buildup of pressure in the interior of the eye, which is known as glaucoma. 

If your eye doctor does not find anything wrong with the eye, then following up with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> as well will be recommended, as there are also some medical conditions (such as high blood pressure or migraine) which may cause blurry vision."
My eye got swollen - why is this happening?,"I would go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this for help figuring out what is going on. 

In the first place, since you got in a fight, it would be important to make sure this wasn't caused by a blow to the eye. The veins in the tissue that surround the eye are very delicate and they can be damaged, leading to swelling and (after a day or two) ""black eye"". Your doctor can see if there is any evidence of this. They can also rule out any more serious damage to the eye from a blow, such as a scratch on the surface of the eye or <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a> inside the eye. 

Assuming that you did not sustain any damage to the eye, then it is possible that the swelling is completely unrelated to the fight and might be caused by something else. For example, superficial infections of the eye (called conjunctivitis) are very common, and they can cause swelling, redness and discharge. Similarly, eye allergies are a common problem, and you might have been exposed to something that you are allergic to, causing the eye to swell. 

Start by seeing your primary care doctor as soon as you can for help. Hope you feel better soon!"
My eyes are yellow. Is this jaundice?,"You are definitely correct that a yellow discoloration to the eyes raises the possibility of jaundice (technically, jaundice means a yellow discoloration of the skin, whereas the word for a discoloration of the eyes is 'icterus'). 

Jaundice occurs when bilirubin levels in the blood rise. Bilirubin is a waste chemical that is detoxified and removed from the body by the liver, so jaundice (or icterus) usually means a problem with liver function or with the bile ducts that drain the liver. Jaundice and liver dysfunction can easily be diagnosed with simple blood tests, and it sounds like you have already had these tests done - and that they were normal. 

This means, therefore, that the discoloration of your eyes is unlikely to be jaundice. There are, however, a few other causes of discoloration. Sometimes, the color of the eye can change from chronic irritation or exposure to sunlight. Sometimes, it can be a genetic trait that is inherited or passed down in your family. Occasionally, the coloration can be from an area of tissue that grow in from the corner of the eye, called either a pterygium or a pinguecula. The best thing to do would be to see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> at your earliest convenience to get a diagnosis and figure out whether any treatment is available. "
What to do about sore eyelids?,"I strongly recommend that you go to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> right away. If you cannot get in to see your eye doctor, then an emergency room might be a good alternative to get a quick eye examination. 

The way you are describing the symptoms, which include sudden onset of pain and redness, make the likelihood of a foreign body in the eye, or trauma to the surface of the cornea, very likely. This can occur quite suddenly and often by accident. For example, there are many instances of people accidentally scratching their corneas with their fingernails when raising their hands or rubbing their faces or eyes. 

Your eye doctor or emergency room doctor will be able to examine her wife's eye closely, probably using a special lamp called a slit lamp or a special dye that glows in the dark and causes any foreign bodies or corneal scratches to show up more readily. At the same time, they will be able to rule out other types of eye conditions, such as an infection, or acute glaucoma of the eye. 

Based on what they find, they will recommend an appropriate treatment, which will likely involve medicated eye drops. Go see the eye doctor right away!"
Blood in eyes - 4 month old daughter?,"I would recommend that you have this checked out by your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> as soon as you can.

The most common cause of blood in the white part of the eye is a subconjunctival hemorrhage. Most of the time, these are caused by crying or other straining which bursts one of the small fragile blood vessels in the white part of the eye. When this happens, some blood leaks out and you get the bright red appearance in a patch. Most subconjunctival hemorrhages are benign and don't need any particular treatment. 

However, before saying this, it is important to examine the eye closely to make sure that there is not a more serious form of eye trauma or other cause of this <a href=""/procedure/bleeding-1071"">bleeding</a>. Your pediatrician can examine your child closely to make sure the eye is ok. They can also make sure there are not any other signs of easing bruising or bleeding elsewhere on your child's body. 

If this is just an isolated subconjunctival hemorrhage, they will probably just recommend close observation. However, if there are any other concerning signs, they may want to perform additional testing. 

Contact your pediatrician's office and make an appointment as soon as you can. "
Im 37 and noticed graying around my brown eyes. What could this be?,"There is a condition called arcus senilis, where a grayish ring forms around the outer edge of the iris (colored part of the eye). This ring is often more pronounced in the top half of the eye. In older adults, arcus senilis is a normal part of eye aging and is never something to be concerned about. In younger adults like you, however, it is important to have a complete check up with your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> and with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. This is because, if this does turn out to be arcus senilis, then it may be a sign of high levels of cholesterol in your blood stream. 

If your doctor says that this is not arcus senilis then, on the other hand, it is worth noting that as we mature the pigment levels in our irises do change slightly. Therefore, it can certainly be possible to notice changes in the color of your iris, say from brown to gray, and for that to be completely normal. 

Finally, rarely, rings of color around the iris may be signs of another more serious medical condition, such as Wilson's disease.

Start by setting up a visit with your eye doctor at your earliest convenience. "
Why do I have blurry vision after waking up?,"The most common reason for blurry vision after waking up from sleep (assuming this gets better after a few minutes) is having some dried out tear secretions floating around on the surface of the eye. This happens in most people, and is part of the reason that many people ""rub their eyes"" when they wake up; they are trying (unconsciously most likely) to clear up their vision by removing these secretions. 

Another common cause would be eye allergies, or allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis symptoms (itching, burning, watering, and redness of the eyes) are often worse when getting up from sleeping, especially if the person is allergic to dust, mold or mites, as these tend to be concentrated in the mattress, blankets, and pillows. 

I would mention this problem to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. They can check out your eyes and your vision to make sure there is nothing going on. If the symptoms of blurriness do not resolve during the day, or if you have other concerning symptoms such as floating spots or flashing lights before the eyes, then you need to see a doctor right away! "
Is it bad if I don't wear glasses when I have -2.50?,"Glasses and other forms of corrective vision wear (like contacts) are designed to help you see better! That being said, the factors that lead to deterioration of the vision are, in most cases, independent of whether or not you actually wear them. In other words, not wearing your glasses shouldn't cause any worsening of your vision in and of it self. 

That being said, you should always wear your glasses when doing important tasks, such as driving, if your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> has determined that doing so is necessary. Otherwise, you will be putting yourself and others at risk. Also, if you have any trouble seeing the board at school, that would be an indication for wearing the glasses. If you do not like the way the glasses look, then you could explore the possibility of <a href=""/procedure/contact-lenses-99"">contact lenses</a> with your doctor. 

The major side effect of not wearing your glasses when they are necessary, other than not being able to see, is that this may contribute to eye strain or fatigue. Although this doesn't permanently damage your vision, it can be uncomfortable. 

I suggest that you talk with your eye doctor or <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a>, who can help you come up with a eye wear prescription that you feel more comfortable wearing all the time. "
Is there a way to improve your vision?,"The general trend is vision is that, due to the normal effects of aging, once your vision starts to deteriorate and you 'cross the line' into needed to wear glasses or contacts, then there is no going back. In fact, it is common for vision to continue to slowly deteriorate over time, requiring periodic tweaking of your glasses or contact prescription by your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. 

Unfortunately, there is no non invasive way to prevent or reverse this deterioration in eye sight. Of course, it is important to have regular eye examinations (at least once a year) to make sure that you do not have any other eye diseases, as detecting and treatment them is an important part of protecting the eye sight. Also, having yearly physical examinations with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> is important, as there are several medical conditions (such as diabetes and <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a>) that can have bad effects on the vision if they are not controlled. 

There are surgical procedures that can be used to correct vision and get you back to a place where you do not need to wear glasses. LASIK is the most common procedure, which most people have heard of. If you are interested in a procedure like this, that would be something to talk to your eye doctor about. "
Why do people get eye diseases?,"It is difficult to answer this question specifically without knowing a bit more about what exact diseases your relatives have. 

There are, of course, many different eye conditions that are associated just with age and that tend to develop over time as we get older. However, some of these conditions also do have a strong genetic component. For example, both glaucoma and macular degeneration, two disease that tend to develop in the elderly, have at least a partial genetic component. 

The best way to protect yourself against eye disease is to have regular checkups with your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. In fact, for most adults, it is recommended that you have a basic eye examination on a yearly basic, regardless of whether or not you have any symptoms or have any corrective vision needs. At this visit, an eye doctor will screen you for all of the common eye diseases, including glaucoma and macular degeneration. If you have not had an eye exam in a while, your doctor will most likely want to dilate your eyes at least once so that they can get a good look at the back surface of your eye, which is where many diseases show up initially. "
Why does the bridge of my nose hurt?,"Sinus congestion can definitely cause pain that is sort of spread throughout the <a href=""/procedure/bridge-17"">bridge</a> of the nose as well as the cheeks and forehead. However, all of the swelling with sinus congestion is on the inside; it should not cause any obvious swelling on the outside. 

One likely possibility is that the pain and swelling are from your glasses pinching the bridge of your nose. This is a pretty common problem, especially if you have recently gotten new frames. If this is the case, I would recommend that you go back to see the <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a> who prescribed the glasses to you. They can take a look at where the pressure points are occurring and adjust your glasses so the they fit your face better. 

On the other hand, if this is not from your glasses and if it persists, then your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> would be a good person to get advice from. They can rule out other potential causes of this pain and swelling, such as a minor skin infection in the area of the bridge of your nose.

Make an appointment with your optometrist or primary care doctor today, and I am sure that you can get to the bottom of this quickly.  "
Is too much computer use bad for a person's eyes?,"For a long time we have wondered whether the increase time that people spend in front of a computer screen would have detrimental effects on brain function and eye sight.  So far, we have not found any definitive evidence that this is the case.  There are millions of people that work desk jobs in front of a computer all day and so far, we have not seen an increase in the rates of vision problems later in life.  With that said, there is no way for us to know what the effects will be down the road.  Perhaps staring at a computer screen for 10 hours per day may cause problems when you're 70 years old.  Without evidence of this, no one should recommend that you make any changes to your job or life style right now.  

You should however have your vision checked on a regular basis.  Some people like to have their vision checked every year or every several years (depending on if their are any problems) by an <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a>. I suggest that you schedule an appointment today.  An optometrist is a <a href=""/optometrists"">doctor</a> who performs vision tests and fits patients with the right prescription lens.  This way you can be sure that your vision is not changing over time.  "
Is my eye twitch something serious?,"The most common type of eye twitching is called blepharospasm, which is actually a twitching motion of the eyelid and not the eye itself. 

Generally speaking, blepharospasm is brought on by eye fatigue or stress, and it goes away quickly when you have time to rest. If this is the case, you may notice that the twitch is worse after, for example, a long day staring at a computer screen. Other common causes that are associated with blepharospams include caffeine and alcohol consumption, eye allergies (such as seasonal allergies), and dry eyes. 

I would recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> about this condition. They will be able to examine your eyes and help discover if there is a treatable reason for your eye twitch. For example, if you have eye allergy problems, this is something that can be cleared up easily with simple medications. 

If your eye twitch is actually motion back and forth of the eye itself and not of the eyelid, this could be nystagmus. Nystagmus is sometimes a symptom of a serious medical problem and therefore it also requires evaluation by your eye doctor or your primary care doctor as soon as possible. "
What should I do if my eyes won't focus?,"There are several potential causes of your symptoms. Probably the most common thing is that you may be suffering from eye strain. This commonly occurs in people who perform long tasks such as staring at a computer screen all day. If, for example, you notice that the problem occurs only after a long day at work,this is probably what is going on. In addition to taking regular breaks from work, other things that often help this problem can include using good posture, using an anti-glare screen on your computer monitor, and the like. 

However, you should also see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for an eye examination. As we age, sometimes our vision changes and we no longer have 'perfect vision.' One of the most common causes of eye strain or trouble focusing is actually the development of mild nearsightedness. 

Your eye doctor will be able to perform a full eye examination to help determine if you might need corrective eye wear for your vision. They will also be able to screen you for rarer and more serious eye conditions which could be causing your problems.

In general, it is recommend that everyone should have a full eye examination about once a year, even if they have 'perfect vision.' Good luck!"
Can your family doctor test for glaucoma or do you have to see an eye doctor?,"Glaucoma, as you probably know, is a serious eye condition that occurs when pressure builds up inside the eye, usually gradually,which can eventually lead to blindness if it is not detected and treated. Glaucoma does have a genetic component, so you are at higher risk because of the fact that your father's family has the condition. Unfortunately, glaucoma usually doesn't have any symptoms until it has progressed significantly; for this reason screening for glaucoma is recommended.

Unfortunately, although testing for glaucoma is very simple and only takes a few seconds, the machine that is used to test for it is used only by eye doctors and not by family doctors. Therefore, you will need to make an appointment with your regular <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for this exam. Regardless, it is recommended that most people should have an eye exam with their eye doctor every year (in addition to the annual exam they have with their <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a>). In addition to checking for glaucoma, eye doctors check for numerous other eye conditions and also test your vision, so the visit will definitely be worth your while!"
Why are my eyelids puffy?,"There are a few possibilities here. One is that you have blepharitis, which is an infection of the edges of the eyelids right where the eyelashes come out. Blepharitis is usually provoked by chronic irritation of the eyelids, and it usually responds really well just to good hygiene and warm compresses to clean the surface of the eyelids. It is also important to stop using any mascara or other eye makeup until the condition clears up, as this is a major factor in bringing on blepharitis. 

Another possibility would be that you have allergic conjunctivitis, or eye allergies, and that the allergies are provoking the itching and tearing on the surface of your eyes, which you are then interpreting as itching of the eyelids. Also, with allergic conjunctivitis it is common to have some eyelid puffiness. Allergic conjunctivitis usually responds well to the usual anti allergy medicines like antihistamines. 

I suggest that you get in to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a>. Please seek help urgently if you have any severe symptoms, like puslike discharge from the eyes, eye pain, or <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a>. These would be symptoms that the problem requires more aggressive medical treatment. "
What should I do if there is blood in my eye?,"If you actually see a demarcated area of bright red blood in the white part of your eye, then this is likely a subconjunctival hematoma. This occurs when a small blood vessel under the surface of the white part of your eye bursts, allowing blood to escape. This most commonly occurs with coughing or straining, but it can also occur accidentally, for example by bumping or scraping your eye. Subconjunctival hemorrhages, although they look ugly, rarely require medical treatment, as they get better on their own over a period of days to weeks. 

Second, if the area of 'blood' is actually more like a general redness or irritation, then this could be conjunctivitis, inflammation of the white part of the eye, either from an infection or from allergies. To rule out the possibility that you have conjunctivitis, you should see your <a href=""/optometrists"">doctor</a> who will be able to recommend an effective treatment. 

Furthermore, if you have any concerning symptoms, such as severe eye pain, blurry vision, or <a href=""/procedure/headache-499"">headache</a>, these might be signs of a more serious problem and you should seek immediate medical help. "
Should I be worried about my blurry vision?,"If your vision is currently blurry, then you probably need re-evaluated by your <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a>.  Over time, everyone's vision changes because of changes in the lens which is responsible for focusing light in our eyes.  Thus, people that where glasses need to have there lens prescription changed every few years to accommodate these changes.  For some people it take longer for these changes to happen.  Because this problem is so common, you need to have this evaluated first.  There are other problems that can occur which can cause blurry vision.  For example, cataracts can cause disruption in vision because they prevent light from making it to the retina.  While cataracts typically happen in older people, certain medications can also be a culprit.  If you take steroids for an inflammatory condition, then this is a possibility.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your optometrist.  He or she can test your vision using a Snellen chart which tells the <a href=""/optometrists"">doctor</a> how bad your vision is in each eye.  From there, you can try a new prescription for eye glasses to see if that corrects your vision.  If your vision is not correctable with new lenses, then you will probably need to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> for further evaluation.  "
Why do my eyes hurt when I look to the side?,"By far the most common cause of this type of pain, especially if it is occurring in both eye, is simply strain of the eye muscles. This is especially common in people who work at a computer screen all day or perform other task that require careful use of their eyes. Usually it improves with regular rest periods and with reducing environmental work problems, like glare on the computer screen. However, a fair number of people who have this kind of eye strain actually have a minor vision problem (such as near sightedness) that has been undiagnosed; if they wear appropriate corrective eye wear then the strain tends to go away!

Therefore, my first recommendation for you would be that you go to see your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for a complete vision check up if you have not done so recently. They will be able to determine whether you need corrective eye wear. They will also be able to make some additional recommendations on how to reduce eye strain. 

Rarely, eye pain like this can be a sign of a more serious eye problem, especially if there is redness of the eyes, blurry vision, or pain of the eyeball itself. If you have these symptoms, you should seek emergency attention from your eye doctor. "
How can I prevent blurry vision from staring at a computer all day?,"It sounds like you are suffering from 'computer vision syndrome' which is a very common problem in people who work at a computer all day long. Computer vision syndrome is simply a problem of eye fatigue, and it doesn't result in permanent damage to your eyes. 

The first thing I would do is go to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> and have a complete eye checkup. The most common factor that predisposes to computer vision syndrome is actually having an small undiagnosed vision problem, such as a small degree of nearsightedness. Even very small vision defects can put you at much greater risk of eye strain when using a computer. Therefore, the first step is to see if you need corrective eyewear, either glasses or contacts. If you do, then using the vision correction should mostly reduce the fatigue you are having while working on the computer. 

It is also important to pay attention to the work environment. In particular good working posture and reducing glare of the computer screen (from a window or over head lights) can help reduce eye strain significantly. 

Start by setting up a visit with your eye doctor today, and I hope you are feeling better soon!"
Can it hurt your eyes if you sleep with contacts in?,"The answer to this question depends a lot on your own personal tear chemistry and eye characteristics, as well as the type of contacts you use. In other words, you will have to ask your own <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for advice. 

There are some contacts that are made to be left in while you sleep and there are other contacts that are definitely not made to be worn while asleep. If you have the former type of contact, as long as you properly clean then and dispose of them when it is time for a new pair, then it should be fine to sleep with them in. On the other hand, if your contacts are not made to be worn around the clock, then you could be potentially damaging your eyes by leaving them in. 

Even in the case of contacts that are made to be worn continuously, there are some people who, because of their personal eye characteristics, cannot tolerated wearing them like this. In other words, use common sense - if your eyes feel irritated after sleeping with your contacts in, then this is probably not right for you. 

Your eye doctor will be able to provide you with more individualized advice. "
Do I have to go to the eye doctor if I have perfect vision?,"The question depends in part on your age and whether you have any other medical problems. Most young adults with no vision problems and no medical problems or any visual symptoms probably do not have to see their <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> very frequently. 

However, as you age, it is important to start having regular eye checkups. There are several reasons for this. First, as you age your vision may start to deteriorate without you noticing right away - your doctor might be able to pick this up before you would and recommend corrective eye wear if necessary. Secondly, as you age you start to be at risk for eye diseases, such as glaucoma (which is a build up of pressure inside the eye). Therefore, it becomes important to have regular eye exams in order to screen for these diseases; importantly, most of the time these disease can be picked up with screening tests by your doctor long before you would notice any symptoms. Finally, as you age you tend to begin to develop medical problems, like <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a> or diabetes. These medical problems can have a negative effect on the health of the eyes, and it is important to look out for this. 

Please talk to your eye doctor for specific information about how frequently you should have an eye exam!"
Why do I see black spots in front of my eyes when I stand up?,"There are two potential causes here. 

First of all, sometimes when you stand up or change positions quickly, your body's vascular system doesn't have time to respond appropriately by constricting the veins in your feet and legs. When this happens, blood pools in your legs temporarily and the blood flow to your brain is very briefly affected, leading to symptoms like <a href=""/procedure/dizziness-vertigo-468"">dizziness</a> or black spots in front of the eyes. You can solve this problem by staying well hydrated, by changing positions slowly, and by talking with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> to determine whether you might be taking any medications that could be making this problem worse. 

The second possibility are floaters. These are small collections of protein that form inside the liquid of the eye ball with normal aging. They cast shadows on the retina and therefore are seen as dancing grey or black spots or wavy lines. They are generally not much of a nuisance, but they may be more noticeable when changing position quickly as they suddenly shift around under the influence of gravity. 

You should talk to your primary care doctor or your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> for more information."
"What is causing my eyes to be dry, crusty, and itchy?","If your symptoms have been present for some time now, I would recommend making an appointment to be seen by an ophthalmologist to get your eyes examined. Part of what a physician will be able to do in the visit is take a thorough history, which would be very helpful. For instance, from the information that you have given me thus far my first thought was that there may be a component of allergies. I am not sure if you have a history of seasonal allergies, but these symptoms are frequently seen in the setting of allergies. If you have other symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, etc, then you may benefit from an oral selective antihistamine. These can be bought over the counter (like Zyrtec) or provided via prescription from a physician. If the symptoms are specific to just your eyes, and after an exam your physician does think it is allergies, then it may be fixed with eye drops. If you just recently developed the crusting and itchy eyes all the sudden, you may have developed an infection like conjunctivitis, or pink eye. I wish you all the best, and definitely recommend making an appointment to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. "
Do you need to go to the eye doctor if you have perfect vision?,"The short answer to your question is, yes! You should absolutely go to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> at your age. As you point out, early in life the primary role of the eye doctor is to work on problems associated with not seeing so well and needing contacts or glasses. 

However, as we age, the chances that we could develop some other disease of the eyes that needs to be detected go up. For example, glaucoma is a serious cause of blindness that occurs when the pressure in the inner chamber of the eye because gradually to high. Your eye doctor will check for glaucoma. Furthermore, if you have any other medical conditions, such as <a href=""/procedure/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-208"">high blood pressure</a> or diabetes, these could have effects on your eye health or your vision, and your eye doctor will be able to look for them. 

Generally speaking, people your age should probably have an eye exam about once a year. This exam will include checking on your visual acuity (which can also decline with aging) as well as looking for other eye disease. Your doctor may also want to dilate your eyes from time to time to get a better look at your retinas; ask about this when you set up your appointment. "
Why am I having trouble focusing my eyes?,"Problems with your vision can often cause headaches and poor balance. Diseases affecting vision can arise from the eye, the part of the brain that interprets visual stimuli, or the nerve fibers that transfer information from the retina to the brain. There are a number of optical problems that can cause your focus to be off. For example, blurred vision at a distance but clear at near is called myopia (nearsightedness). This is the most common optical disorder where an affected individual might try to accommodate by squinting, getting close to the words, or complaining of blurred vision when far away from an object. On the other hand, a person with hyperopia or farsightedness experiences blurred vision when focusing on near object but clear when at a distance. Astigmatism occurs in patients who have difficulties with clarity at both near and distance.  In addition, a binocular vision refers to a variety of conditions in which the eyes drift inward, outward, or upward.  In such cases, it may result in a person experiencing <a href=""/procedure/double-vision-410"">double vision</a>. He or she may notice losing their place on a page while reading, sensing that letters or words appear to move, the need to close or cover one eye, and discomfort associated with reading.  Depending on your age and risk factors, you may need to get an eye exam by an <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a> and possibly a <a href=""/family-physicians"">family doctor</a> to make sure that you don't have other common conditions that affect vision such as diabetes, hypertension, and transient ischemic attacks.  Good luck."
Why are my baby's eyes rolling?,"All newborn babies have poor control over the muscles that move the eyes, just as they have poor control of all the other muscles in their bodies! At first babies can not even focus on objects and they see everything as just blurry shapes and shadows. However, by about 2-3 months of age, a baby should be able to focus at least momentarily on an object and follow it briefly with their eyes. If your baby is not doing this, this could be an indication of something wrong that needs to be evaluate. 

Even though at this age a baby can focus briefly on an object, this does not mean that they can coordinate the movement of their two eyes simultaneously! Therefore it is common for babies to be 'cross-eyed' at 2-3 months of age. However, by 4-5 months of age, they should be learning to coordinate their eyes and the cross-eyed look should be going away. Therefore if your baby continue to have cross-eyed moments for much longer, it is not unreasonable to have an evaluation by a pediatric eye doctor.

Talk to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> if the symptoms continue or if you have further questions. "
Is sunlight bad for your eyes?,"There is a lot of evidence that too much exposure to strong sunlight can be bad for your eyes. As you know sunlight contains ultraviolet rays. These are high energy rays that can produce burns to the skin, which is why you wear sunscreen lotion when you go outdoors for longer periods of time. Interestingly, ultraviolet rays can also penetrate and damage the eyes over time. In particular, research has linked exposure to ultraviolet rays to the development of cataracts and macular degeneration, which are two of the most important causes of impaired vision in older adults. Therefore, there is some good sense to wearing sunglasses when you will be outside in bright light. 

Of course, this is more difficult to do when you have to wear prescription glasses. However, you could talk to your local <a href=""/procedure/eyeglasses-98"">eyeglasses</a> store. Many manufacturers of eyeglass lenses offer special lens coatings that darken and lighten depending on the amount of light. There are also such things as prescription sunglasses. 

Additionally, you should always make sure to keep up with your yearly appointments with your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. In addition to checking out your prescription, your eye doctor is also looking for cataracts and other eye diseases. "
What are the things I see floating in front of my eyes?,"What you are seeing in front of your eyes are something called 'floaters.' Floaters are probably the most common eye condition and, usually, they are not a sign of a serious eye problem. 

Your eye is full of a thick liquid called vitreous. This liquid contains multiple proteins and, over time, small bits of these proteins 'coagulate.' This is a normal age-related process, and the number of coagulated bits of protein tends to increase over time. Since these coagulated proteins are not transparent to light, they cast shadows on the retina, which you perceive as moving floating spots in front of the vision. They move because they are, in fact, floating in the vitreous under the influence of gravity. 

There is no effective treatment for floaters. Protecting your eyes from strong sunlight, by wearing sunglasses when outdoors, may help slow down their development. At the same time, however, as they are a basically normal phenomenon that everyone has to one degree or another you don't need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> that they mean there is something wrong with your eyes. 

You should mention them to your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> when you go in for your yearly eye checkup. However, typically nothing is done about them unless they are so severe that they are impairing vision. "
How often should I get my eyes examined?,"There is no recommendation for routine eye examination. Therefore, to answer your question, if you are asymptomatic and feeling fine -- you do not regularly need to get your eyes checked. If you are having any problems with your vision or your eyes that prompted this question - -then please see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> at once.

There is no screening for your eyes that is needed for otherwise healthy people. An ophthalmologist, or eye doctor, only sees people who have specific concerns. For example, people with diabetes or taking specific medications require annual check ups to ensure the eyes are not deteriorating. 

If you are concerned, you may want to visit an <a href=""/optometrists"">optometrist</a> (not an ophthalmologist). An optometrist is not a doctor, but someone who specializes in vision. They can be found at many eyeglass stores and in most malls. They can help you check your vision to make sure there are no major problems. While an optometrist cannot check the parts of the eye that a trained ophthalmologist can -- they can do a generalized ""once over."" Again, this is not necessarily required -- but something you could do if you are concerned. They can help determine when/if you need glasses.

Good luck!"
How is distorted vision from crossed eyes treated?,"This is a concerning symptom. I would recommend that you discuss this with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>. If needed (and quite likely) you will need to be sent to an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a> (known as an ophthalmologist). This should be addressed as soon as possible.

Firstly, vision is a complex process. There are three fundamental components to the vision process in the human. One, is the eye itself. The eye is a complicated structure that transmits light to the retina (the part of the eye that ultimately interprets the visual images we seen). Second, are the nerves (known as the optic nerves) that carry the images to the brain. Third, are the brain centers involved in vision. There are multiple areas in the brain that are responsible for processing, aligning and interpreting the images that the eyes see.

Now, in order to determine if or how to help your vision, we need to determine which of the three parts mentioned above are causing the problem. If there is a problem with the eye, an ophthalmologist can identify this. Subsequently he or she may be able to treat this. If not the eye, you may need to see a brain doctor (<a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a>) to help.

See your doctor early as if not treated early, permanent damage can occur. Good luck!"
I just got diagnosed with pinguecula. What should I do now?,"A pinguecula, although a scary sounding condition, is not as serious as it sounds so the first thing to do is to take a deep breath.  They are actually fairly common.  It is defined as a noncancerous growth of the conjunctiva, which is the mucus membrane lining the eyeball and underside of the eyelids.  It appears as a small yellowish nodule near the cornea.  It is usually on the side close to your nose.  The cause is unclear but it is thought to be due to sun exposure (as it is more prevalent in tropical climates) and irritation of the eyes.  Pinguecula occur most often in those over 40.  It is a benign condition that usually requires no treatment.  It may increase in size very slowly over many years.  Lubrication with artificial tears might help any discomfort.  Temporary discontinuation of <a href=""/procedure/contact-lenses-99"">contact lenses</a> or a change in the type of lenses that you wear might be necessary.  Occasionally mild steroid eye drops are needed to decrease the inflammation. It is important to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">ophthalmologist</a> to have a full eye examination and to discuss appropriate treatment for your particular case.  Make sure to always protect your eyes from the sun with UV blocking sunglasses."
Should I replace my prosthesis?,"The field of prosthetics and orthotics has indeed advanced a great deal in thd last few decades.  When it comes to an evaluation of your <a href=""/procedure/prosthesis-1245"">prosthesis</a>, the best place to start is with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a>.  He or she can make sure that you don't have any other health concerns with regard to your prosthesis and can also help facilitate a referral to the appropriate prosthetics / orthotics department for further evaluation.  

The most important thing to consider when it comes to replacing your current prosthesis is how well it is working for you.  There have been both functional and aesthetic improvements in prosthetic devices since yours was made, but on the other hand if what you currently use allows you to do all of the things you need and want to do, you may not want to go through the process of trying to get another device made and fit to your foot.  However, new devices may be able to give you increased range of motion and ability to do things as well as being more natural looking in appearance.  A good prosthetician can go over these options with you and discuss the risks and benefits of pursuing a new device.  He or she can also go over the costs, as insurance may or may not cover something new."
What if I get a fungal medication into my eye?,"Generally speaking, anytime that you accidentally get a medication in your eyes, you should seek medical help, either from your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or from your <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. 

Most medications will have brief instructions as part of their packaging that describe what to do immediately after getting the medication in the eye. This often includes flushing the eye with water for several minutes, removing <a href=""/procedure/contact-lenses-99"">contact lenses</a>, and the like. Therefore, I would first recommend that you take a look at the packaging for the particular medication that you have to see what it recommends and follow these instructions. 

After following these emergency instructions, the next step is to go see the doctor. This is important because sometimes there can be continuing damage to the eye, especially if the medication is not entirely removed, despite following the emergency instructions. This damage may require medical treatment, for example with eye patching or with topical eye medications, and close followup to make sure that the eye is healing well. 

Therefore, I would book an appointment with your doctor right away to be seen. If you can't get in to see your doctor soon, another option would be to visit the emergency room (especially if the pain in the eye is severe). "
Why do I always wake up with red eyes?,"It sounds like this is a rather vexing problem!  You have clearly given your situation a great deal of thought, and many of the things you suggest can sometimes cause red eyes.  However, as you point out, none of them truly seem to fit the situation your describe.  The best way to identify what is causing your symptoms is to see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye specialist</a> right away.  Getting to the bottom of what is causing your symptoms will require a careful review of not only your history but also an eye exam.  You mentioned taking accutane as a child, but other prior or current health issues and/or medications can affect your eyes so it will be important for an opthalmologist to consider these issues when evaluating your eye.  Furthermore, some eye problems are manifestations of other systemic illnesses, so your <a href=""/eye-doctors"">doctor</a> will want to know about any other new symptoms or changes in your health you have noticed recently.  Finally, when considering any kind of eye problem, a full examination including dilation of the pupil is very important.  From your description it is not clear if the lining of  the eye (conjunctiva) or the white of the eye (sclera) is red, and your doctor will want to use a slit lamp and fundoscope to look inside the eye to identify which part of the eye is irritated/inflamed.  Also, if you do notice any vision changes or pain, you should seek medical care at an emergency department."
What can cause watery eyes?,"There are three basic ways in which the eyes become too watery, and the causes vary based on the mechanism at play. An individual may experience watery eyes due to excessive tear production, inadequate drainage of a normal amount of tears, or inflammation in the eyes. Excessive tear production can actually be stimulated by overly dry eyes, superficial foreign bodies, cranial nerve V irritation, eye strain, and situational occurrences such as <a href=""/procedure/vomiting-1119"">vomiting</a> and laughing. Poor clearance of tears can be caused by laxity of the eyelid or obstruction of the nasolacrimal (tear) duct that drains tears to the nose. Inflammation due to conjunctivitis, blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid) or allergies, for example, can also lead to watery eyes. Constant, excessive watering of the eyes is a reason for your mother-in-law to consult her <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>. 

The first step in the evaluation will be to obtain a more detailed medical history and conduct a physical exam. Simple information such as the use of contacts, change in environment, presence of other allergies or allergic symptoms, and the presence/absence of any systemic symptoms can go a long way in helping to define the cause. Once this is established, her doctor will be able to devise a treatment plan targeted to the specific etiology than can help reduce the excessive water in her eyes. "
Why is my eye bloodshot?,"There are many reasons that your eye may be blood shot (conjunctivitis, as it is known to doctors), and this is a very common condition that your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care </a><a href=""/eye-doctors"">doctor</a> can help address. The most important thing to be sure of is that your vision remains good. If there have been any changes in your vision, you should see an <a href=""/ophthalmologists"">eye doctor</a>, or even your primary care doctor, immediately. This could be a sign of something serious that needs to be addressed. 

If your vision is fine, there are several possible causes, most of which are not potentially dangerous to your vision if they are corrected in a timely manner. Redness is most often a manifestation of irritation, and so anything that would irritate your eye could cause redness. Likewise, anything that decreases irritation will often lead to improvement. Minor trauma can often happen, even while you sleep, and can lead to a red eye. This will usually improve slowly over a few days. Dry eyes can also lead to redness, as can sunburn or allergies. Wearing contacts too much without cleaning or other problems with contacts can also cause irritation. Frequent rubbing from any other reason will also lead to irritation. Please speak to your eye doctor or primary care doctor to determine what may be causing your red eye. I hope your eye gets better soon!"
"Why do I have watery, itchy eyes?","I recommend you discuss this issue with your <a href=""/eye-doctors"">doctor</a>. If your itchy eyes are related to a cold, then it is usually something that will resolve with time. What most people don't realize is that pink eye, the common infection that kids get and spread so easily, is just another variant of many of the common upper respiratory tract infections that we commonly get. Because of the intimate connection between the nose, the throat, and the eyes (they all share common drainage pathways), and an infection in one part can spread rapidly to the others. If your eyes have been itching during a cold, they should start to do better as the cold resolves. You can help them by keeping them well hydrated (such as with drops) until they start to do better. If they are painful, then it is a good idea to see a doctor. This is especially true if your vision ever changes for the worse, as this could be something that needs to be seen immediately. Small scratches on your eyes can come from itching too aggressively, and so you need to be careful with that. If your problem persists, please speak to your doctor. And in the meantime, please wash your hands regularly."
How do I get rid of the orange/red circle of veins in my eye?,"I think this is unlikely to be a popped blood vessel in the eye. Although these do occur, the tend to cause a large, reddened spot of discoloration under the clear part of the eye where the blood spills out. It sounds like what you have, on the other hand, is simply prominent blood vessels in the clear part of the eye. 

These prominent blood vessels could be caused by a number of different conditions leading to inflammation or chronic irritation of the eye. For example, seasonal eye allergies are a common cause of prominent, irritated blood vessels. Other causes might be exposure to physical irritants, like wind or dust. Finally, some chemical exposure can cause eye irritation; this might occur from exposure to chlorine in the eyes from a swimming pool, for example. 

I would suggest going to see your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this issue. They will be able to examine your eyes and help determine what is going on. If this is irritation due either to a physical or chemical exposure or allergies, your doctor will be able to prescribe medications, which might be either eyedrops or oral medications, in order to reduce the inflammation. 

Good luck!"
My eyes are always itchy and watery no matter the season or day. Why? ,"If you haven't talked to your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> about this yet, that would be the first step. You need a doctor to take a look at your eyes and help figure out whether this redness and itchiness is coming from. 

By far the most common cause of red and itchy eyes is allergic conjunctivitis. The type of allergic conjunctivitis that you are most likely familiar with is the kind caused by seasonal allergies, which it sounds like you do not have. However, there are other types allergies which can cause redness and itching of the eyes. These include various ""indoor"" allergies, such as allergies to mold or mites. These symptoms can occur year round. 

Another potential cause would be blepharitis, which is an inflammation of the edges of the eyelids. Blepharitis is often caused by chronic irritation from eye makeup or other chemicals. However, it can also sometimes be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. 

Your doctor will be able to examine you and confirm which diagnosis--either one of these two, or another condition-- you have. Based on the diagnosis, they will be able to recommend appropriate treatment, which might include anti allergy eyedrops or pills, or antibiotics in the case of an infection. "
Why are my wisdom teeth growing sideways?,"It sounds like you are ready to have your wisdom teeth removed. While many <a href=""/dentists"">dentists</a> believe that wisdom teeth should be removed at some point, all would agree that they need out when they are causing problems like they are now.  There are several theories as to why our wisdom teeth seem to come in crooked and sideways much more often than they should. The leading theory is that our jaws are not large enough to accommodate a 3rd molar and thus when they decide to come in, they bump up against the 2nd molar and pop through sideways. They can become impacted, infected, and cause your other teeth to move in crooked.  Wisdom teeth coming in crooked almost never has anything to do with your gums being bad or unhealthy.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with an <a href=""/oral-surgeons"">oral surgeon</a>. The fact that your teeth are already painful means that you should not hesitate to be seen.  He or she can take a close look at all of your teeth and decide which of your 3rd molars need removed. Likely, the decision will be made to remove all of them to prevent any further problems you may have in the future. Good luck.    "
Did I have a growth spurt yet?,"It sounds like you have many questions about the physical changes of puberty.  Your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> is always an excellent and confidential resource for you to discuss questions or concerns about your health.  You are correct that your final adult height is often related to the height of your parents.  In order to tell whether you are still growing or whether you have completed puberty, a physician will need to examine you to determine your state of physical development.  If you have not developed fully adult male body hair patterns, then it is likely that you are not yet done growing.  It can also sometimes be very helpful to plot your height on a growth curve because in many cases a child's adult height can be predicted based on the patterns of his or her growth as a child.  This may be part of the reason that a physician told you last year that your estimated adult height is 5'4"".  However, the best way to determine whether or not you have completed puberty or whether you are still growing is to be examined by a physician this year.  If you have any further questions about this process, you can discuss them with your pediatrician. Good luck!"
Why has my 3-year-old had a persistent dry cough and now a red patch on his soft palate?,"You mention a number of different symptoms, which may not all be related to each other. It is important to discuss your concerns with his regular <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, as that is the <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> who knows him best and will best be able to answer your questions. 

For example, his platelet count is a little elevated and it sounds like his chest x-ray is a bit abnormal. This might indicate that he has an acute infection, such as a <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a> or pneumonia, which might need to be treated with antibiotics (if it is severe), or potentially just observed (if caused by a virus and not very severe). 

On the other hand, it sounds like the persistent dry cough, sneezing, and snoring are potentially a separate issue which have been going on for quite a bit longer. These might be signs of an allergic condition, such as chronic nasal allergies, which could cause these symptoms. Alternatively, they may be a sign that his adenoids have enlarged again, or that his tonsils are enlarging into his airway (if he did not have his tonsils removed when he had his adenoid surgery). 

I would start by discussing your concerns with his pediatrician at your earliest convenience. "
My son has a rough red rash on the back of his hands - what is it? ,"The only way to be certain of telling what this rash is would be to take your son to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. It is very difficult to diagnose rashes over the internet, but often very easy to do so in person!

That being said, there are several common types of rash that are the most likely causes of your son's symptoms. 

The first is <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, which is a condition in which the skin becomes excessively dry, reddened, and irritated. Eczema is often worse during the cold winter months, and it can also be made worse by frequent exposure to water and soap. It is usually diagnosed with just the physical examination, and it can often be treated easily with medications called steroid creams to reduce the itching and inflammation, along with a lubricating product to keep the skin moist. 

The second would be contact dermatitis, which is similar to eczema in terms of its symptoms, but which is triggered by exposure to some substances (such as a chemical, new soap, metallic object) that the skin reacts to. Contact dermatitis is treated in much the same way as eczema (steroid creams), as well as avoiding whatever the trigger substances was. 

Make an appointment with your son's pediatrician!"
Is there a relationship between outbursts and ADHD?,"I'm sorry to hear that you family is dealing with this problem! The good news is that ADHD is a very common problem in childhood, and there are many resources available to help you out!

Children with ADHD do often have trouble with impulse control. This can lead to behaviors like outbursts, so it is likely that these behaviors are part of your son's ADHD symptoms. However, children with ADHD are also more likely to have other conditions that can cause certain types of outbursts, such as Tourette's syndrome. 

Therefore, I think the best first step is to work with your child's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> and <a href=""/psychiatrists"">psychiatrist</a> to define whether these outbursts are related to his ADHD or not. His <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctors</a> may recommend beginning treatment for ADHD with medications and seeing if the outbursts improve. If so, then there is no particular need to worry about another diagnosis and, if not, additional treatments could be pursued. 

It would also be a good idea to meet with your son's teachers to see if he needs any specific accommodations in the classroom and school in order to maximize his opportunities for success there. 

Good luck working through this complex issue!"
Is it safe if babies prefer solids to milk?,"Milk is a vital part of your young child's overall health in the early stages of development, but this will gradually become less so over time. While breast milk is obviously noted to have significant advantages to both the mother and the child, even the formulas that are so common will have excellent formulations of essential vitamins and minerals that are necessary for your child to grow in the healthiest manner.

If you feel that your child is changing his diet too aggressively and not getting the well rounded diet that he needs, speaking with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> may be appropriate. He or she will be able to check your son's height and weight on a growth chart to make sure that there are no disturbing trends, and then be able to answer specific questions. He or she may recommend adding some formula or breast milk to help in mixing the solid foods that you are feeding your baby to make sure that all of his needs are met. There may be other findings suggested in your routine well baby checkup that would make your doctor more of less concerned. Please speak with your baby's doctor about your concerns."
What should I do if my daughter's neck keeps clicking?,"I would take your daughter to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> at your earliest convenience to have this issue checked out.  

I assume that your daughter is not bothered by this clicking, that is, that there is no pain, stiffness, or trouble moving the neck, nor any recent history of a fall or trauma to the area. If this is not the case, then I would prioritize evaluation much more quickly, as the clicking sound may be related to a more serious problem in the neck. 

However, in the absence of these symptoms or history, the clicking sound is much more likely due to normal elasticity in the ligaments around the bones of the spine, which can sometimes make a ""snapping"" sound, or to the production of small air bubbles in the spinal fluid (analogous to the sound that occurs when you crack your knuckles). 

Nevertheless, your pediatrician will be able to perform a thorough examination, looking for any evidence of spinal misalignment or other issue that might require additional workup, such as X-rays of the spine, or referral to a specialist, such as a pediatric orthopedic <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>. 

Please make an appointment with your daughter's pediatrician at your earliest convenience!"
What are the risks involved in lactose intolerance?,"This is a discussion to have with your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. Lactose intolerance is relatively common, particularly in people from certain parts of the world.  In fact, by adulthood some experts estimate that most people will have some degree of lactose intolerance.  Overall the term lactose intolerance refers to a condition in which a person does not have the ability of break down the sugars found in milk, specifically lactose.  The enzyme that breaks down lactose is called lactase and is typically produced by the cells lining the intestine.  When a person does not produce this enzyme, the lactose sugars cannot be broken down and can contribute to causing abdominal bloating, gas, and crampy <a href=""/procedure/abdominal-pain-1063"">abdominal pain</a>.  This is, of course, not particularly pleasant for the person involved, so the best treatment is to avoid foods that contain lactose, i.e. milk products including cheese, yogurt, and ice cream.  The good news for your son is that an intolerance is NOT the same as an allergy--milk products will not cause your son to go into an anaphylactic reaction such as can happen with children who are allergic to peanuts.  You will not have to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about carrying around a syringe of epinephrine (the so-called epi pen) in case of severe allergy.  An intolerance causes distressing but not life-threatening symptoms.  The best thing for you to do in this situation is make sure that you schedule a visit with his pediatrician to go over how to keep your son healthy and how to ensure that he receives adequate nutrition, given that milk products will not be a part of his diet for now."
What is slapped cheek disease?,"This is definitely something that should be discussed with the child’s <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or primary care doctor.

Slapped cheek disease generally refers to an infection with parvovirus B19.  It is also known as 5th disease.  This refers to the fact that it was the 5th childhood viral <a href=""/procedure/illness-75"">illness</a> with a rash discovered (behind measles, mumps, rubella and German measles). It is a relatively common infection that often occurs in kids.  The infection generally is fought off by the body's immune system and the kids make a full recovery.  The virus causes a rash that usually occurs on the face.  Kids also tend to look sick.  They'll have a fever and may look a little lethargic.  If your neighbor's daughter only has a rash on her face and no other symptoms, 5th disease is unlikely.  

Referring to the patient in question, if there is concern that this little girl has an infection, her parents should seek care from a pediatrician immediately.  He or she will be able to tell what she has (if anything) and provide reassurance.  If 5th disease is diagnosed, the child is likely to get better unless she has another medical illness that causes <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a>.  She and the entire family will need to stay away from pregnant women because the infection in a pregnant woman can be detrimental to the fetus. 

The child’s parents should book an appointment today."
Do ovarian cysts affect pregnancy?,"I think that your daughter and you should talk a bit more with her regular <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> or her OB GYN doctor to get a specific answer to your question. I say this because there are basically two circumstances in which cysts in the ovaries could be diagnosed. 

The first, and most likely possibility is that these are functional cysts in the ovaries. Basically, the normal process of ovulation every month produces cysts in the ovaries as part of the body's regular cycle. If an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> is done, these are often picked up and the diagnosis of ovarian cysts is given. This emphatically does not, however, mean that this is a disease; rather it means that the ovaries are doing what they are supposed to do!

On the other hand, if the ultrasound shows that both ovaries are full of many cysts, rather than just the scattered functional cysts I mentioned above, then this could be a condition, known as polycystic ovarian syndrome. Polycystic ovarian syndrome, unlike regular functional ovarian cysts, can be sometimes associated with trouble with fertility as well as irregular periods and other problems. 

Talk to your daughter's doctor, who will be able to clarify this issue for you and give you additional direction."
Is it normal to have periods which last 9-10 days of very light flow? ,"The average length of a period is between 5 to 7 days. ""Average"" means that there are plenty of women who will have periods that are shorter than this, and there are also women who will have periods that are longer than this. As you also noted in your question, the fact that you are young means that your periods are more likely to be longer or irregular, and that they tend to get shorter and more regular as you get older. 

Nevertheless, this is definitely a good issue to bring up with your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care doctor</a> or your adolescent doctor the next time you have a visit. Sometimes long periods can be a problem, especially if they lead to excessive blood loss, which can cause <a href=""/procedure/anemia-384"">anemia</a> and fatigue. 

Your doctor will be able to perform a complete checkup to make sure that everything is looking normal! Sometimes they may want to check some basic blood work or get an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> of your uterus and ovaries at this visit, but not always. 

They will also be able to answer any other questions you might have about your general health, including other questions about your menstrual cycles. Book an appointment today!

Good luck!"
Why does my 9-year-old have a severely swollen face and blotchy red spots?,"Your daughter's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> could certainly be right that these symptoms are related to some sort of viral infection, as this is definitely one of the most common causes of rashes in this age group. However, the fact that there has been no <a href=""/procedure/fever-1019"">fever</a> or other clear signs of a viral infection (like runny nose or cough) is somewhat perplexing, because classically these “viral rashes"" appear a few days after the other symptoms, such as fever, have already started. 

Another possibility would be an allergic reaction, which could be related to something your daughter has come into contact with. Even though you can't recall using any new products in the home, for most allergic reactions, an offending source is never really found. If you notice that the rash responds well to the anti-histamine then that might be further evidence that this is an allergic type rash. 

I would suggest going back to see your daughter's pediatrician again, now that this has been going on for a few days. Sometimes, the only way to arrive at the correct diagnosis in these cases is to have your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> look at the rash a few different times, so that they can see how it changes and evolves over time. Book an appointment today."
Could sweet smelling sweat be a sign of diabetes?,"Some individuals with untreated diabetes can develop a fruity odor, most prominent on the breath, that is caused by the production of certain chemicals called ketones, in response to the prolonged elevation of blood sugar. Most of the time, there are other symptoms present at the same time, such as <a href=""/procedure/frequent-urination-1253"">frequent urination</a>, dehydration, and lethargy. Therefore, it is unlikely that your daughter has diabetes; that being said, it is definitely something you should mention to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. If your daughter has any other more concerning symptoms, such as those I mentioned, then you should seek immediate medical evaluation. 

Additionally, there are a number of rare metabolic conditions which are caused by defects in the way the body breaks down various chemicals. Several of these metabolic conditions - which include phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease - can cause strong or unusual body odors. Fortunately, most of these conditions are screened for at birth by a newborn screen, which was probably performed on your daughter when she was born before she was discharged home from the hospital. Assuming this testing was normal, then the possibility that your daughter has one of these conditions is extremely low. You can verify that this testing was done by checking in with your daughter's pediatrician. Again, please discuss with her <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctors</a> soon."
What does it mean when your collarbone sticks out?,"I would recommend that you mention this issue to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or to your adolescent medicine <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>. They will be able to examine your collarbone and make sure there are no signs of a serious medical problem that might require workup or treatment.

Most of the time, a difference in the appearance of the two collarbones is not a significant medical problem, as it usually just represents a minor difference in the shape of the two bones. 

Sometimes, one collarbone may be more prominent if it has been previously fractured. After a fracture, the area where the fracture heals is often a bit distorted or thickened. This is a normal part of the healing process and is not something to be concerned about. 

You would need to be more concerned about this issue if you have or if you develop any other symptoms, such as stiffness in the shoulder or pain in the shoulder joint, pain over the collarbone, or pain in any other joints of the body. In this case, there may be an underlying inflammatory condition affecting your joints that would need to be diagnosed and treated. 

Again, please discuss with your doctor. Good luck!"
Why won't my cough get better??,"I would strongly recommend that you go to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or your adolescent medicine <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> for a checkup as soon as you can. Any time a cough lingers for as long as yours has, especially when it seems to be getting worse, it should be evaluated by your doctor. They can help figure out whether or not you need additional treatment at this time. 

One possibility is that you started with a simple upper respiratory infection (such as the common cold) which has now progressed to a more serious problem, such as a lung infection (pneumonia) or a sinus infection. Your doctor should be able to tell if you have a serious infection after a physical examination; if so, you may need to take antibiotics to help clear things up.

It is also possible that you are suffering from another condition that might cause lingering cough, such as <a href=""/procedure/asthma-210"">asthma</a> or nasal allergies. Again, this should be apparent on the physical examination. Both asthma an allergies can be effectively treated by inhaled or oral medications that your doctor can prescribe for you. 

In addition, your doctor will be able to follow up with you to make sure that you are getting better and that any medication you are taking is working. Good luck and please see your doctor soon!"
Can sinus problem develop into bronchitis?,"Sinus congestion, cough, and some of the other symptoms your son is suffering from can all be caused by the same types of bacterial or viral infections. Typically, an upper respiratory tract infection will begin with minor symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and then either clear up (most of the time) or progress to more stubborn and persistent symptoms, such as sinus congestion or deep cough. 

The best rule of thumb is that whenever the symptoms have not gone away after a few days or are getting worse (as they sound like they are in your son's case), then you should go to see a <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>. Your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> will be able to perform a full examination and help figure out whether any additional treatment is needed. 

The types of things that will need to be ruled out would include a true sinus infection or a serious lung infection such as pneumonia. These can both be triggered by an initial common cold or other similar infection, and they usually need to be treated with prescription antibiotics. 

If on the other hand your pediatrician determines that this is just <a href=""/procedure/bronchitis-390"">bronchitis</a>, then antibiotics will most likely not be necessary, although medications to help relieve the cough and other symptoms may be of some use. Again, please discuss this with your pediatrician soon."
Should I have this splinter removed?,"Splinters can be very painful, both going in and when they need to be removed!  If your daughter has had the splinter in for a year it is unlikely to cause any long-term problems.  But to be safe, you should have her evaluated by her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>.  He or she can examine the area and determine the best way to try and remove it.  Foreign objects (such as splinters) are typically most concerning at the time of the initial accident because of concerns about infection.  Clearly that is not the case in this situation.  However, it will be equally important to make sure that trying to remove the splinter doesn't cause significant scarring, bleeding, or any possible damage to surrounding structures.  Your daughter's pediatrician should be able to assess these issues by examining the area.  If there is any concern, he or she can also refer your daughter to either a plastic <a href=""/surgeons"">surgeon</a> or a <a href=""/hand-surgeons"">hand surgeon</a> for further evaluation of the best way to remove the splinter.  If she acquires any splinters in future, it may be best to consider having a physician examine the area at the time of injury because that is often the easiest time to remove them!"
How long is a mother contagious that has shingles to her infant?,"This is a question you should discuss with your <a href=""/primary-care-&lt;a href="">doctors</a>""&gt;primary care doctor. Shingles, as you probably know, is caused by the same virus (the varicella virus) that causes chicken pox. Shingles is actually a reactivation of the chicken pox virus in an older person, as the virus never completely leaves the body after a case of chicken pox in childhood. 

Both the chicken pox and the shingles sores are contagious because the virus is found in high concentrations in the crusty secretions from the sores. The sores are no longer contagious when they are completely dry. Using good hand hygiene and avoiding contact with the sore areas is the best way to prevent spread. 

It will also be important to follow this closely both with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> and also with the doctor who is treating your case of shingles. Chicken pox, although formerly a common childhood infection, is less common now with vaccination. Sometimes, cases of chicken pox can be quite serious, and therefore keeping a close eye on your child and getting regular advice from your pediatrician as this case progresses is the best way to ensure that things turn out ok. Your regular doctors can examine the sores and help determine whether they are still contagious and whether you need to take any precautions to prevent spread. Please discuss with them soon."
What's causing my son's upper leg pain?,"There are several different causes of pain in the leg, but since this has been going on for two days now with no obvious source, I think it is worth going to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> for an evaluation. 

Most of the time, this kind of pain ends up being from a minor twist or sprain, from running or playing sports. However, you should mention to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> when you go to see them if there have been any falls or other events that might have resulted in trauma to the leg. If so, this might make your doctor lean more towards getting some x-rays, as might any positive findings on the physical examination. 

Also, in children, unexplained leg pain is sometimes a sign of osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone caused by bacteria. Make sure to tell your doctor if you have noticed any fever, as that would go along with a potential diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Your pediatrician may want to obtain some basic blood work looking for signs of inflammation or infection to rule out this possibility. 

Start by contacting your pediatrician's office today! They should easily be able to help you figure out whether this is something that you need to <a href=""/procedure/worry-175"">worry</a> about. "
What's wrong with my hamstring?,"Sorry to hear you are having so much discomfort in your leg! You should definitely go see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about this as soon as you can, since it sounds like it has been going on for a while. 

The most likely cause is that you have pulled your hamstring. This commonly happens in those who play different types of vigorous sports. It can also happen if you accidentally fall or twist your leg. Pulls of the muscles in the hamstring can take a long time to heal. Often, get back to normal requires resting from vigorous exercise as well as basic stretching exercises and anti inflammatory medications. 

If your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> finds evidence of a hamstring pull, they will be able to recommend medications for the pain and swelling. They will also be able to give you advice about whether you need to stop playing sports for a while, or whether you need to do some stretching exercises. They can also rule out any other possible causes of the pain and ""knot"" sensation, such as a big <a href=""/procedure/bruise-contusion-1175"">bruise</a> inside the muscle. 

Make an appointment with your doctor right away. In the meantime avoid any vigorous physical exercise until you have gotten the green light from your doctor. "
What causes a painful lump in the armpit?,"You definitely need to take your child to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> right away! If you can't get in to see his pediatrician right away, then you should go to an emergency room for an immediate evaluation. 

I am concerned that this lump in the armpit represents an <a href=""/procedure/abscess-1066"">abscess</a> or other infection. These can sometimes start off as ""swollen glands"" like you mention, but a golf-ball sized lump in a 4 yr old is very big! Also the pain is concerning. 

In the emergency room or your pediatrician's office, your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> can evaluate the lump. If there is a sign of an infection or an abscess, it may be that the lump needs to be opened up so that the pus can be drained out. Also, antibiotics will most likely be necessary to get the infection under control. 

There are other less common causes of swollen glands in the armpit that are also serious. For example, this can be caused by lymphoma, a type of cancer. However, given the pain and suddenness of this problem, I think infection is more likely. Regardless, your doctor will be able to evaluate things and make recommendations about what work up and treatments are needed!"
My one year old has a large lump on the back of his head with no injury. Should we go to ER?,"Your son should get care form a <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> soon. The fact that he has been pulling at and rubbing his ear suggests to me that he may have an <a href=""/procedure/ear-infection-111"">ear infection</a> or a respiratory infection or throat infection causing backup of pressure and liquid in the ear. Importantly, these conditions can also cause enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and I strongly suspect that the large bump on the back of your son's neck is probably an enlarged lymph node. 

However, I do think that your son deserves another evaluation. In particular the fact that he is abnormally lethargic is concerning to me. I understand that you went to the doctor yesterday and that everything seemed fine at that point. However, with this new lethargy, that might be a sign that things are getting worse, not better. 

It would be very reasonable to take your son to an emergency room for evaluation. Another reasonable option would be to contact your pediatrician's office and ask for an urgent care visit, assuming that they can get you in to be seen quickly. In either setting, the doctor can make sure that your son is safe and that he doesn't have any signs of a serious infection. Good luck!"
What causes white spots on your gums?,"I am not aware of any association between seizure medication and white spots appearing on the gums. I would suggest that you take your son to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or his <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> in order to get these spots checked out. 

There are several potential causes of the white spots that your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctors</a> will consider. First, there is a condition called thrush, which is a yeast infection in the mouth. This tends to occur in people who have depressed immune systems, but it can also occur in others, especially in those with complicated medical backgrounds, as in your son's case. 

Another possibility are canker sores, which are small, usually painful, ulcers which have a whitish appearance and can occur throughout the mouth. The exact cause of canker sores is not clear, although they do seem to be brought out by physical or emotional stress in some people. 

Finally, a viral infection of the mouth, such as by the herpes virus, may cause whitish sores or blisters that also tend to be quite painful. 

Your son's pediatrician can take a look in his mouth and help figure out what these white spots might be and what treatment, if any, might be needed."
My daughter has pus pockets in her throat - why?,"I assume by 'pus pockets' that you mean that your daughter has pus covering the surface of the tonsils when you look in the back of the throat. This sort of throat infection can be cause by a number of different bacteria and viruses, including the strep and mono that she was already tested for. Unfortunately, since there are so many different potential infectious causes, it is often hard to tell what is exactly causing the infection, if the strep and the mono come back negative. Fortunately, in most cases, it does not matter, because with close attention and care from her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, the condition generally tends to resolve without any serious complications. 

If, on the other hand, by pus pockets you mean that your daughter actually has a deeper infection inside the throat, then this is potentially more serious, because it might require drainage of the pus or hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics to get over the infection. If this is what is going on, it is important to act quickly before the infection has a chance to spread or worsen. 

Your pediatrician will be the one who is best able to guide you through this process and give you the advice you need. Please continue to discuss this issue with him or her!"
Sometimes I wake up and I can't see or hear - what's wrong with me?,"The first thing I would do is ask your parents to take you to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. Your pediatrician is the doctor who knows you best, and they can evaluate you for the presence of any serious medical conditions. 

The most likely cause of your symptoms is something called sleep paralysis, which is a relatively common condition in which a person wakes up before the brain's sleep mechanism becoming fully disengaged. This can lead to a very unpleasant sensation where someone is awake but cannot move the body. There may also be other symptoms, such as the ones that you describe. 

Mild intermittent cases of sleep paralysis do not need treatment. However, if this becomes a recurrent issue, it definitely should be evaluated. Often, worsening sleep paralysis is associated with certain lifestyle factors, like sleep deprivation. It may also be associated with various medical conditions, including seizures and narcolepsy. 

Your pediatrician will be able to perform a complete physical examination. Based on what they find, they will be able to help decide whether any treatment is needed or whether any additional workup or visit with a specialist doctor, such as a <a href=""/neurologists"">neurologist</a> or <a href=""/sports-medicine-specialists"">sleep doctor</a>, is needed. 

Good luck!"
Can malnutrition affect facial development?,"Malnutrition can be a significant problem for some adolescent males. In the United States, the most common causes of malnutrition in this age range include serious gastrointestinal disease, like inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), and eating disorders. 

When malnutrition occurs in adolescents, the most likely effect will be that it will delay the onset of puberty. If the underlying cause of the malnutrition is caught in time and treated appropriately, most males will go on to have normal pubertal development, assuming that they remain adequately nourished. However, in some severe cases, the development of normal features associated with puberty may be permanently altered. This, in particular, tends to affect the impairment of adult stature (how tall someone is). Also, in some cases, chronic inflammation associated with some forms of malnutrition (inflammatory bowel disease, for example) may permanently decrease the production of testosterone, leading to trouble with secondary sex characteristics, like facial hair patterns. 

If these are issues that you are dealing with, then you need to discuss them as soon as possible with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>. You could start with your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>, although if delayed puberty is a significant problem you will probably also need to see a pediatric <a href=""/endocrinologists"">endocrinologist</a> for help. "
Why do my knees hurt when I bend to pick something up?,"I recommend that you ask your parents to take you to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. Any time that knee pain goes on like this for several weeks without resolving, it should be checked out by your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>. Your doctor can examine the knee and help figure out what, if anything, is going on. 

When you go to your doctor, make sure to mention to them any sports injuries, falls, or other things that might have been associated with the onset of your pain. Also, mention if you have noticed any swelling or redness of the knee, and mention if you notice anything else that makes the pain worse (for example, walking versus sitting). 

There are several different cause of knee pain that your doctor will consider. For example, a condition called ""runner's knee"" (or patellofemoral syndrome) is very common. Other common causes of knee pain in your age group include tendonitis and Osgood Schlatter syndrome. 

Based on what your doctor discovers, they will be able to help decide whether or not you need any additional workup, such as x-rays of your knee. They will also be able to recommend which medications you might take to relieve the pain. 

Good luck!"
"My daughter is an avid swimmer, and her toes are dry and bleeding - why?","I highly recommend that you take your daughter to see her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> about this issue. It does sound like there is something chronic going on here, and your pediatrician should be able to help you figure out what it is!

One potential clue here is the fact that the symptoms seem to get better with the application of a steroid cream. Since steroid creams are used to treat skin inflammation, this means that probably there is some inflammation underlying your daughter's symptoms. One of the most common causes of skin inflammation is something called <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>. This is a condition in which the skin becomes excessively dry, leading to redness, itching, and cracking. The fact that your daughter is an avid swimmer also is relevant here, as chronic moisture and exposure to water is one of the factors that can lead to persistent eczema. 

Fortunately, eczema can be treated, although it generally requires persistent and care. Steroid creams are definitely part of the treatment and, when applied to the skin of the feet, there are not really any significant long term consequences of using them. Furthermore, using a good skin moisturizer to protect against the water exposure can be very important. 

See your pediatrician as soon as possible!"
Why are my 8-year-old's nails brown?,"I would recommend that you take your daughter to see her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. There are a few different potential causes of this brownish discoloration, and they will be able to help you figure things out. 

For example, if all of your daughter's finger and toe nails are equally discolored, then it is more likely that this is some sort of chemical or dye exposure. Frequent use of certain nail polishes, for example, can result in some permanent discoloration of the nails. 

On the other hand, fungal infections of the nails can also cause thickening and discoloration, although this is somewhat less likely to affect all of the nails equally. 

Your pediatrician will take a close look at your daughter's finger and toe nails and help decide what are the most likely possibilities and, if necessary which treatments should be used. If this turns out just to be a staining reaction, no specific treatment will be necessary, as the nails will slowly grow in normally. On the other hand, if this turns out to be a fungal infection, it may need to be treated with a prescription anti fungal medication. 

Please set up a visit with your pediatrician at your earliest convenience. "
Is my toddler having trouble breathing?,"These symptoms sound concerning an should prompt you to see your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> very soon.  The problem that your daughter is having is either from her lungs or her heart.  Her <a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">acid reflux</a> could also be playing a role.  If she has very severe reflux, some of this fluid may be entering her lung making her cough.  If she does not produce adequate oxygen exchange during this time period, she will turn blue.  She may be grabbing her throat because it hurts from the acid.  Other possibilities would be a congenital heart disease.  However, with no murmur ever noticed on exam, and the problem just now being seen, this is unlikely.  Another problem could be a lung disease like cystic fibrosis.  If she had a very mild case of cystic fibrosis, it may not get noticed until now.  

I suggest that you schedule an appointment with your daughter's pediatrician today.  He or she will be able to examine your child's chest for signs of any lung or heart disease.  Any abnormal lung sounds or previously not identified heart murmurs will need further work up.  Her <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> may also want to measure your daughter's oxygen levels to make sure she is oxygenating her blood normally.  If anything abnormal is found, then she may need referral to a specialist.  "
What could cause high white blood cell count in a child?,"There are a few different causes of an elevated white blood cell count. Since the white blood cell are involved in fighting off infections in the body, almost always a white blood cell count that is elevated means that your son has just been fighting off an infection. 

The most common scenario in which this occurs is that you bring your child to the <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> for a regular checkup visit, and the <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> orders routine checkup blood work that comes back with a high white blood cell count. This typically just means that your son has just gotten over some viral infection (like a common cold), and the usual thing to be done is to just repeat the blood work in a few weeks to make sure that the count has come down. 

In rare cases, a high white blood cell count can be a sign of a serious problem, most typically a blood cancer like a leukemia or a <a href=""/procedure/lymphoma-385"">lymphoma</a>. Even though this is not at all common, this is the reason that your pediatrician is being cautious and checking additional blood work. It will be important to followup closely with them to make sure that everything turns out normal."
Is psoriasis hereditary?,"<a href=""/procedure/psoriasis-87"">Psoriasis</a>, as you know, is a chronic skin condition which is autoimmune, meaning the body attacks the skin, leading to red, itching, and scaling spots on the skin. 

Psoriasis does have a strong genetic component. For example, about 40% of people with psoriasis have family members with psoriasis. However, there are also cases of psoriasis that occur without any family history. What this means is that, although there is definitely a genetic component, there is no guarantee that a person will develop psoriasis just because of genetics. There are numerous environmental factors, including various infections, smoking, and other factors, that can serve as triggers to bring psoriasis out in a person. 

In short, we can say that your child is likely to be at higher risk of developing psoriasis given the fact that you suffer from the condition. However, they may not develop the condition. 

The best thing that you will be able to do for your child is make sure that they have regular visits with their <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. Make sure that, after your child is born, you mention to the pediatrician your personal history of psoriasis. At your child's regular visits, they will look for signs of psoriasis as well as ensure that your child is otherwise generally healthy. "
Why my nine year old get chest pains while eating?,"Chest pain while eating and chest pain in a child are both somewhat unusual.  The best thing to do in this case is for your daughter to see her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> right away. He or she can talk with you and with her more about her symptoms and go over the rest of her medical history as well as a thorough physical exam. Hopefully this will help get to the bottom of whatever is causing her this discomfort!

There are several different things that could be contributing to her symptoms.  First, <a href=""/procedure/acid-reflux-heartburn-1032"">acid reflux</a> or 'heartburn' can often be interpreted as chest pain.  Reflux symptoms are more common in adults, but they can occur in children as well.  Second, your daughter could have something in her stomach (an <a href=""/procedure/stomach-pain-ulcer-1029"">ulcer</a> or irritation known as gastritis) that is causing this pain in the setting of eating.  Ulcers are also not common in children, but they can occur.  Your pediatrician will probably also want to know more about the timing of this pain as well as how long after food it occurs.  Food allergies to milk, wheat, or other food products can often cause indigestion and abdominal discomfort shortly after eating.  Many times symptoms in the abdomen can be referred to the chest area.  Finally, depending upon the timing of her symptoms, it is also possible that your daughter may have pulled or strained some intercostal muscles or even be developing a respiratory infection and that is causing the chest pain.

Your daughter should definitely be evaluated by a physician as soon as possible, and hopefully she will be feeling better soon!"
How can I make sure that my son does not get pink eye?,"Pink eye is another term for the condition conjunctivitis.  Conjunctivitis is an inflammation (often caused by an infection) of the conjunctiva.  This is the thin, transparent outer lining of the eye.  The vast majority of cases of conjunctivitis are caused by a virus.  The common culprit viruses are usually the same types of viruses that cause the common cold.  They are commonly spread through hand to hand contact.  Thus, washing your hands frequently is the best method to preventing its spread from person to person.  There is no treatment, other than lubricating eye drops for the symptoms.  The other cause of conjunctivitis that is much less common is a bacterial infection.  This is a much more serious infection that requires more immediate treatment with antibiotics.  

If you are worried that your son may have conjunctivitis, then I suggest that you schedule an appointment with his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>.  His <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> can examine his eye closely and determine what type of conjunctivitis it is.  If there is any concern at all that it could be the bacterial version of the infection, then his doctor will give you a prescription for antibiotic eye drops.  If his doctor is sure that it is the viral type, then some soothing lubricating eye drops are all that is needed.  Good luck.  "
What is wrong with my daughter's birthmark?,"Based on the description that you are giving, it sounds like your daughter has the type of birth mark known as a macular stain. These are small malformations in the tiny blood vessels, called capillaries, under the skin, and they are extremely common. In common language, they are variably known as 'stork bites', 'salmon patches', or 'angel kisses.' Because these macular stains are composed of blood vessels, they are sensitive to thing that increase blood flow. In a young child, these most typically would be crying or other types of emotion; therefore, it is very common and totally normal to have these spots look darker at these times. 

If you have not talked to your <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> or pediatric <a href=""/dermatologists"">dermatologist</a> about this issue, I would still recommend that you do so. First of all, to confirm that this is indeed just a macular stain and not another form of birthmark. Second, because most of the time macular stains are beginning to fade after the first 1 or 2 years of life. If the stain is still strongly present at 3 years of age, then this might be a sign that it is going to persist for years. If so, depending on the size or location, it might be a cosmetic problem and you might want to discuss treatment options with your pediatrician or pediatric dermatologist. "
Is caffeine bad for children's skin?,"Soda, coffee, and other similar drinks that contain caffeine do not typically cause any trouble with the skin.  This does not mean that children should be allowed to drink caffeine in large amounts. Caffeine can have multiple effects on children, most typically interfering with their normal sleep cycles. Additionally, it is not recommended that children be allowed to drink large amounts of soda, because these contain lots of empty sugar calories which displace healthy nutritional foods and may contribute to problems with becoming overweight. 

The fact that your nephew is having <a href=""/procedure/rash-504"">skin rashes</a> is definitely something that needs to be investigated, however. Children commonly suffer from food allergies and <a href=""/procedure/eczema-166"">eczema</a>, which are the typical causes of chronic skin rashes. 

The best step would be to encourage your nephew's parents to bring them to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>. The pediatrician will be able to provide good advice on how much soda and caffeine intake is healthy for the child. They will also be able to take a look at the rash and help figure out what the likely cause of the rash is. Additional testing may be needed, including allergy testing, but the child should see his pediatrician as soon as possible first!"
What happened when my son had his vaccinations?,"The small knot that you feel under your son's skin is most likely just a small immune reaction to the vaccine itself.  These are quite common and are usually benign.  What can happen is that a group of immune cells move into the skin in response to the vaccine to try and fight what they think is an infection.  They create a small granuloma (the bump) that hangs out for a while and then goes away.  The bump could also be a small piece of connective tissue that you are just noticing now after the injection.  

Despite this probably being a benign thing, you should still be seen by a <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a>.  Any time you notice any possible reaction to any treatment that a doctor provides, you should always return to be seen.  Thus, I suggest that you schedule an appointment for your son to see his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a>.  He or she can examine your son's injection site and determine if this reaction requires any treatment.  If there is any question of what it is, his doctor may take a look at the bump using an <a href=""/procedure/sonography-ultrasound-256"">ultrasound</a> machine.  Most likely his doctor will give you reassurance that your son's little knot is going to go away soon.  "
How do you cure head lice?,"Head lice is something that we all fear getting for us and our children, but in reality it is a fairly easy problem to deal with.  There are over the counter medications and shampoos that can be purchased at your local drug store.  Deciding on which one can be difficult and having your <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> involved in the decision is always helpful.  In addition, it is always nice to know if your daughter actually has head lice.  While they are common, there are other possibilities that look like head lice.  Unless you have actually seen the parasites, there is always the possibility that your daughters symptoms (itching scalp, etc) are caused by something else.  A quick trip to the pediatrician's office can sort that out.  I suggest that you schedule an appointment today.  If her doctor does see the lice parasites or if the symptoms are consistent enough to try treatment, then her doctor will likely prescribe something or give you some direction on what to buy over the counter.  One option is a permethrin cream or shampoo.  This is a very effective treatment that only has to be done once in some cases.  Be sure to follow the directions closely because using the shampoo exactly like your other shampoo will not work.  Good luck.  "
Do birthmarks ever go away?,"There are many different kinds of skin irregularities that are present at birth (or shortly after) and are referred to as birthmarks.  In general there are two kinds of birthmarks: those caused by cells involved in producing pigment and those caused by irregular vascular markings.  The pigmented birthmarks include moles, cafe-au-lait spots, and the 'Mongolian' spot found on the lower back.  Moles and cafe-au-lait spots typically do not fade with age, but Mongolian spots often do.  Vascular birthmarks include several different pink/tan patches that are caused b an overgrowth of blood vessels.  Hemangiomas will often resolve in childhood, while a nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) usually does not.

With regard to your son's birthmark, the best thing for you to do is to schedule an appointment with his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> to discuss further. Your son's <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> will be able to give you more information about exactly what kind of birthmark your son has and whether it is one of the kinds that will likely fade as he grows older.  There are dermatological options (including <a href=""/procedure/surgery-415"">surgery</a>) to remove or minimize birthmarks, and you and your son's doctor can discuss whether this may be a good option for him as he grows older.

Can someone be allergic to grass?,"It sounds like your daughter's symptoms are very much associated with the time that she spends outside, so it is very reasonable to consider an outdoor exposure as the cause of the rash.  Many people are allergic to grass, so it is possible that your daughter is one of them.  In adults grass allergies are more typically associated with so-called seasonal allergy symptoms, ie watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose rather than skin reactions.  However, some allergies do manifest themselves as <a href=""/procedure/rash-504"">skin rashes</a>, so it is definitely a good idea to take your daughter to her <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> for a more thorough history and physical examination.  In addition to the grass, it is also possible that your daughter is being exposed to something else outside (even another plant, such as <a href=""/procedure/poison-ivy-or-poison-oak-506"">poison ivy</a>) that s causing this rash.  Your pediatrician can go over the rest of your daughter's health history (and hopefully examine the rash) to help determine whether she should be seen by a pediatric allergy specialist.  Some of the medications used to treat allergies in adults have recently been approved for use in children, so if it turns out that your daughter does have specific allergy triggers, there may be treatment options other than simply avoiding the allergen."
Does my son have scoliosis?,"<a href=""/procedure/scoliosis-spine-deformation-1214"">Scoliosis</a> can cause significant deformity of the spine, and it is important to catch it early so that preventive measures can be taken to prevent permanent disability in affected children.  However, scoliosis is most often identified in children a bit older than your son, as most screening for the condition is done in pre-teens or teens.  In your case, the best thing to do is make sure that your son sees his <a href=""/pediatricians"">pediatrician</a> right away.  You can discuss your concerns with his physician, and most importantly the <a href=""/pediatricians"">doctor</a> can examine your son to identify anything that might need further attention.  There are several conditions that can affect a child's growth and skeletal stability.  Many of these conditions are genetic, and it is likely that your son would have already been diagnosed.  Vitamin deficiencies can also affect skeletal growth--your pediatrician may want to get a better sense of how much and what kinds of foods your son has been eating.  If your pediatrician does have any concerns, he or she can order additional imaging tests to examine the bones of your son's back.  Depending upon the results of the exam, a referral to a specialist may be helpful.  However, the first step is a good history and exam with your doctor. Good luck!"
How can one get rid of intestinal parasites?,"Unfortunately, this is the type of issue that needs looked at much sooner than later.  The symptoms of intestinal parasite infection can be non-specific so despite your travel to South America, there is really no way to know what you have without additional testing.  Travel to the developing world can be a risk factor for contracting many illness including intestinal parasites.  Once such culprit is Giardia.  Giardia is a single cell parasite which can hangs out in infected water supplies or infected food.  About 2 weeks after the initial infection patients tend to report very water <a href=""/procedure/diarrhea-1117"">diarrhea</a>, nausea and vomiting (i.e. both ends), severe abdominal pain and excess gas.  If your GI symptoms don't quite fit with this description, you may have caught something else.  Other parasite such as helminths (worms) can have more vague abdominal symptoms (a little pain, indigestion etc).  These can still by harmful to you by causing intestinal bleeding and vitamin deficiencies.    I would suggest further evaluation first by your <a href=""/primary-care-doctors"">primary care physician</a> and then perhaps by and <a href=""/infectious-disease-specialists"">infectious disease specialist</a>.  Bring with you information such as the color, quantity, and event the smell of your stools.  Make sure to write down exactly where you were and what you ate while there.  Good luck.  "
