Is exercise safe for people with abdominal aortic aneurysm?,"Exercise is safe for most people with abdominal aortic aneurysms — with a few caveats. You should avoid exercise that involves lifting more than 50 pounds and prolonged squatting. This combination is particularly dangerous because it can cause a temporary yet significant increase in blood pressure that could rupture the aneurysm.People with small- to medium-sized abdominal aortic aneurysms — up to 5.5 centimeters — who aren't candidates for surgery may participate in moderate exercise, such as walking or riding a bike. However, check with your doctor for specific recommendations based on your overall health and specific circumstances.People with large abdominal aortic aneurysms — more than 5.5 centimeters — should avoid even mild exercise, unless otherwise directed by their doctors."

		My fiance had a semen analysis done. He was told he had abnormal sperm morphology. What does this mean?
	","
Sperm morphology — the size and shape of sperm — is one of the things checked in a semen analysis for male infertility. Sperm morphology results are reported as the percentage of sperm that appear normal when semen is viewed under a microscope. 

Normal sperm have an oval head with a long tail. Abnormal sperm have head or tail defects — such as a large or misshapen head or a crooked or double tail. These defects may affect the ability of the sperm to reach and penetrate an egg. 

However, having a large percentage of misshapen sperm isn't uncommon; in fact, if your sperm sample contains only 4 percent ""morphologically normal forms,"" it's considered normal. 

Morphology is just one piece of a fertility analysis and, by itself, does not determine fertility. Other important factors checked in a sperm analysis are: 

If a semen analysis shows irregularities in any of these areas, a wait-and-see approach is generally tried first. Another semen analysis is usually done after four to six weeks to see whether sperm quality has improved on its own. If there are still abnormalities, tests may be necessary to look for an underlying problem. 

Even with abnormal sperm morphology, motility problems or a low sperm count, it's important to remember that an abnormal semen analysis does not mean you are infertile. Many men with low semen analysis values are still able to father children. It just may take longer, a year or more. If you and your partner aren't able to conceive through sexual intercourse, assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization may be an option.

		Could an abortion increase the risk of problems in a subsequent pregnancy?
	","
Generally, abortion isn't thought to cause fertility issues or complications in subsequent pregnancies. However, some research suggests a possible link between abortion and an increased risk of:

During a medical abortion, a woman takes oral medications — such as mifepristone (Mifeprex) — in early pregnancy to abort the fetus. During a surgical abortion, the fetus is removed from the uterus — typically with a vacuum device, a syringe or a spoon-shaped instrument with a sharp edge (curette) — as an outpatient surgical procedure. Rarely, a surgical abortion can damage the cervix or uterus. In such cases, surgery might be needed to correct the damage before a woman can conceive again.

If you've had an abortion and are concerned about the possible impact on a future pregnancy, consult your health care provider. He or she can help you understand the potential risks, as well as what you can do to help ensure a healthy pregnancy.

		What are acai berries, and what are their possible health benefits?
	","
The acai (ah-sigh-EE) berry is a grape-like fruit harvested from acai palm trees, which are native to the rainforests of South America. Acai berries are widely touted as a so-called superfood, with proponents claiming that they are helpful for a variety of health concerns, including arthritis, cancer, weight loss, high cholesterol, erectile dysfunction, detoxification and improving general health.

Acai berries may be a good source of antioxidants, fiber and heart-healthy fats. But research on acai berries is limited, and claims about the health benefits of acai haven't been proved. 

Many fruits besides acai berries provide antioxidants and other nutrients that are important to your health. But if you'd like to try acai, check your local health food or gourmet stores — acai can be consumed raw, in tablet form, in beverages such as juice, smoothies or energy drinks, or in other food products such as jelly or ice cream.

Are ACE inhibitors safe for people with kidney disease? I've heard conflicting advice on this.,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are often the first medications used to treat high blood pressure in people with kidney disease. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are a good choice because they lower blood pressure and help protect the kidneys from further damage. However, these medications must be used with appropriate caution.All ACE inhibitors and ARBs initially increase serum creatinine and potassium levels. But this increase may be only temporary. Sometimes ACE inhibitors and ARBs cause a persistent decline in kidney function marked by an increase in both serum creatinine and potassium levels. For this reason, your doctor may want to recheck these levels within three to five days after you start the medication.If your serum creatinine and potassium levels are high, your doctor will likely adjust your dosage and then recheck your levels again in three to five days. Typically, a dose can be identified that will lower blood pressure while maintaining acceptable kidney function and serum potassium levels.It is important to note that the blood pressure goal in people with kidney disease is 125/75 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or lower."

		I've read that the dietary supplement acetyl-L-carnitine may reduce fatigue in multiple sclerosis. Is this true?
	","
Some research suggests that acetyl-L-carnitine can improve fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), although more study is needed. 

Acetyl-L-carnitine is a form of L-carnitine, an amino acid that is found in nearly all cells of the body. L-carnitine plays a critical role in the production of energy from long-chain fatty acids. In addition, it increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. 

Fatigue is a common symptom in people with multiple sclerosis. The cause isn't well understood. A study published in 2006 evaluated the benefit of supplementation with L-carnitine in people with MS-related fatigue who had low blood levels of L-carnitine. Study participants were given 3 to 6 grams of oral L-carnitine daily. Researchers reported a decrease in fatigue intensity in 65 percent of participants treated with immunosuppressive drugs, especially in those treated with cyclophosphamide and interferon beta. Another study published in 2004 showed that acetyl-L-carnitine seemed to improve fatigue in people with MS better than amantadine, a drug commonly used to treat MS-related fatigue. 

However, problems with the design of these studies make it unclear whether acetyl-L-carnitine is truly effective at reducing MS-related fatigue. A recent systematic review published in 2012 concluded that there is still insufficient evidence that carnitine offers a therapeutic advantage over placebo or other medications. An ongoing larger scale randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial expected to be completed in 2013 may answer some of these questions. 

Although acetyl-L-carnitine generally has few or mild side effects, it can interfere with anticoagulants and other medications. So talk to your doctor before starting acetyl-L-carnitine or any dietary supplement.

		Is acid reflux the same as GERD?
	","
Acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are closely related, but the terms aren't necessarily interchangeable. 

Acid reflux is the backward flow of stomach acid into the esophagus — the tube that connects the throat and stomach. Acid reflux is more specifically known as gastroesophageal reflux. During an episode of acid reflux, you may taste regurgitated food or sour liquid at the back of your mouth or feel a burning sensation in your chest (heartburn). 

Sometimes acid reflux progresses to GERD, a more severe form of reflux. The most common symptom of GERD is frequent heartburn. Other signs and symptoms may include regurgitation of food or sour liquid, difficulty swallowing, coughing, wheezing and chest pain — especially while lying down at night. 

If you have occasional acid reflux, lifestyle changes can help. Lose excess weight, eat smaller meals, and avoid foods that seem to trigger heartburn — such as fried or fatty foods, chocolate and peppermint. Avoiding alcohol and nicotine may help, too. 

If necessary, occasional acid reflux can be treated with over-the-counter medication, including: 

If you suspect that you have GERD, your signs and symptoms worsen, or you experience nausea, vomiting or difficulty swallowing, talk to your doctor. Prescription medications may help. In a few cases, GERD may be treated with surgery or other procedures.

		Can I harm my natural nails by wearing acrylic nails every day?
	","
Acrylic nails aren't likely to harm your natural nails. It's important to be cautious when using acrylic nails, however. 

Sometimes a gap develops between the acrylic nail and the natural nail. If the acrylic nail is bumped or jarred, it can separate from the natural nail. This gap provides a moist, warm environment in which a nail infection can flourish. A nail infection might also occur if acrylic nails are too long or too rigid, or the nails are applied with unsanitary tools. If you develop a nail infection, your natural nail might become thick or ragged and appear discolored. 

It's also possible to have an allergic reaction to components of acrylic nails or the adhesives used to apply them. This can result in redness, swelling and pain around the nail. 

If you choose to have acrylic nails applied in a salon, take steps to minimize the risks: 

If you opt to apply acrylic nails at home, follow the safety precautions printed on the package. Work in a well-ventilated area, and be careful to protect the skin around your nails from the chemicals used to apply acrylic nails. 

If you suspect a nail infection or have redness, swelling or pain around a nail, consult a dermatologist for an evaluation.

		I have chronic low back pain. Would acupuncture treatments help?
	","
Many people who have chronic low back pain have found acupuncture to be helpful. But the scientific evidence to support these claims has been mixed, partly because it can be difficult to devise a good form of sham acupuncture for comparison. 

Acupuncture for back pain involves inserting very thin needles to various depths into strategic points on your body. Scientific studies have indicated that sham acupuncture works just as well as real acupuncture for back pain. A key point, though, is that both sham acupuncture and real acupuncture relieved low back pain better than having no treatment at all. 

So if other treatments haven't helped your low back pain, it may be worth trying acupuncture. But if your back pain doesn't begin to improve within a few weeks, acupuncture may not be the right treatment for you.

What is acute respiratory distress syndrome?,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition caused by widespread inflammation of the lungs. This inflammation causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels in the lungs. As a result, fluid builds up in the air sacs (alveoli) and other lung tissue. When the air sacs fill with fluid, the lungs can no longer fill properly with air and the lungs become stiff. This makes breathing very difficult.In most cases, the cause of ARDS can't be determined. Doctors refer to this as idiopathic ARDS. Known causes of ARDS include:The main symptom of ARDS is severe shortness of breath. This may develop within minutes or gradually over a few days.

		What does the research say about the relationship between food additives and ADHD?
	","
There's no evidence that food additives cause attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but some studies show that certain food colorings and preservatives may increase hyperactive behavior in some children. Because several studies have looked at a combination of food additives and their possible effects on hyperactivity and ADHD, it isn't clear which additives might affect behavior.

Food additives that may increase hyperactive behavior include: 

The British government has requested that food manufacturers remove most artificial food dyes from their products. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 be clearly labeled on food packaging along with other ingredients. But many colorings and food additives don't require labeling. The FDA's food advisory committee has determined that studies to date have not proved a link between food colorings and hyperactive behavior. More research is needed regarding whether limiting certain foods helps prevent hyperactivity and ADHD symptoms.

Talk with your child's doctor about the pros and cons of trying an elimination diet to see if it makes a difference. Make sure your doctor or a dietitian helps supervise the diet plan, however. A diet that eliminates too many foods can be unhealthy because it may lack necessary vitamins and nutrients.

The approach for your child's overall health and nutrition is a diet that limits sugary and processed foods and is rich in fruits; vegetables; grains; and healthy fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, flaxseed and other foods.

Is it true that caffeine can have a calming effect on a child with ADHD?,"Some studies suggest that high doses of caffeine combined with methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) may be more effective in treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than methylphenidate alone. Like methylphenidate, caffeine is a stimulant. However, too much caffeine also can cause insomnia, nervousness, irritability and increased heart rate. Because of their smaller body size, children are even more susceptible to these effects than adults are. For these reasons, most pediatricians discourage caffeine consumption in children. Caffeine is not recommended as a treatment for ADHD in children."

		Is there such a thing as adrenal fatigue?
	","
Adrenal fatigue is a term applied to a collection of nonspecific symptoms, such as body aches, fatigue, nervousness, sleep disturbances and digestive problems. The term often shows up in popular health books and on alternative medicine websites, but it isn't an accepted medical diagnosis. 

Your adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones that are essential to life. The medical term adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease, refers to inadequate production of one or more of these hormones as a result of an underlying disease. 

Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include: 

Adrenal insufficiency can be diagnosed by blood tests and special stimulation tests that show inadequate levels of adrenal hormones. 

Proponents of the adrenal fatigue diagnosis claim this is a mild form of adrenal insufficiency caused by chronic stress. The unproven theory behind adrenal fatigue is that your adrenal glands are unable to keep pace with the demands of perpetual fight-or-flight arousal. As a result, they can't produce quite enough of the hormones you need to feel good. Existing blood tests, according to this theory, aren't sensitive enough to detect such a small decline in adrenal function — but your body is. 

It's frustrating to have persistent symptoms your doctor can't readily explain. But accepting a medically unrecognized diagnosis from an unqualified practitioner could be worse. Unproven remedies for so-called adrenal fatigue may leave you feeling sicker, while the real cause — such as depression or fibromyalgia — continues to take its toll.

		Is it true that adult acne is the result of a hormonal imbalance in the body? I'm thinking about trying a natural hormone acne treatment.
	","
Hormones likely play a role in the development of adult acne, but hormones generally aren't the root cause of acne.

It's true that some people with hormonal imbalances due to diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome experience more problems with acne. However, the vast majority of those with adult acne have no measurable hormonal imbalance.

A number of so-called natural acne treatments promise to ""equalize"" hormonal imbalances to reduce adult acne breakouts. But ""natural hormones"" are often derived from plants. Their chemical structure is different from hormones produced in the body, so their effectiveness may be limited. And because hormonal imbalance isn't thought to play a major role in acne anyway, the premise behind such products is shaky at best. 

Also, while the Food and Drug Administration has increased the regulations regarding quality and purity of dietary supplements, they're still subject to far less oversight when it comes to efficacy and safety. 

Adult acne can be a distressing and frustrating problem. Successful treatment of severe adult acne may take months or even years. But the good news is that effective treatments are available. If you're concerned about adult acne, consult a dermatologist to learn more about safe, proven treatments. Also, check with your doctor before taking any dietary supplements, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.

"My husband, who is African-American, refuses to wear sunscreen when he is outdoors. He says his naturally dark skin protects him against sun damage. Is he correct? ","No. Everybody should wear sunscreen.Although people with dark skin may not sunburn as easily as those with fair skin, they are still at risk of skin damage from excessive sun exposure. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends routine use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or greater for all people — regardless of skin color.Skin color is determined by the number, distribution and type of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin. Dermatologists refer to the degrees of pigmentation in skin as ""skin types."" Skin types range from very little pigment (type 1) to very darkly pigmented (type 6).It is true that dark skin provides some protection against sun damage. People with light skin types have a much higher incidence of skin cancer than do people with dark skin types. But dark skin is not a guarantee against skin cancer. People with dark skin, hair and eyes can — and do — get skin cancer. Particularly vulnerable areas include under the fingernails and toenails, on the palms of the hands and on the soles of the feet — where skin is lighter.Like those with light skin, people with dark skin are also at risk of premature skin aging from excessive exposure to the sun. This includes wrinkles and mottled or uneven skin pigment.So regardless of your skin type, it's important to protect your skin in the sun by limiting sun exposure and wearing sunscreen and sun-protective clothing when outside.Source: American Academy of Dermatology"

After a flood, be cautious about handling foods and medications that were exposed to flood or unsafe municipal water. They may be contaminated with toxins or germs that can cause illnesses, such as hepatitis or gastroenteritis.

Do not eat any food that may have come into contact with flood water. This includes food packed in plastic, paper and cardboard containers that have been water damaged. Discard food and beverage containers with screw caps, snap lids, crimped caps (soda bottles), twist caps, flip tops and home-canned foods, if they have come into contact with flood water. These containers cannot be disinfected. If in doubt, throw it out.

Undamaged, commercially prepared foods in all-metal cans or retort pouches (packages used to seal food for long-term unrefrigerated storage) can be saved if you remove the labels, thoroughly wash and rinse the outside of the containers, and then disinfect them with a sanitizing solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach to 1 gallon of safe drinking water. Be sure to put on new labels or write the food and expiration date on the containers when you're done.

Any medications — pills, liquids, drugs for injection, inhalers or skin medications — that have come into contact with flood or contaminated water should be discarded. The exception to this is drugs that are lifesaving and not easily replaced. In these cases, if the container is contaminated but the contents appear unaffected — for example, the pills are dry — the pills may be used until a replacement can be obtained. However, if a pill is wet, it is contaminated and should be discarded. After a flood, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately about getting replacement medications.

		Does air pollution make outdoor exercise risky? What if you have asthma or another health problem?
	","
While aerobic activity is one of the keys to a healthy lifestyle, air pollution and exercise can be an unhealthy combination. This is especially true if you have asthma, diabetes, heart or lung conditions, or lower respiratory disease. 

Even when you're not exercising, exposure to air pollution can cause health problems. But with the combination of air pollution and exercise, the potential health problems are increased. For one thing, during aerobic activity you typically inhale more air, and you breathe it more deeply into your lungs. And because you're likely to breathe mostly through your mouth during exercise, the air you breathe in generally bypasses your nasal passages, which normally filter airborne pollution particles.

Health problems that air pollution is associated with include: 

What's not clear with air pollution and exercise is how much exposure is a danger, or how long you have to be exposed. And because exercise has clear health benefits, don't give up on exercise entirely, unless your doctor has instructed you to. Instead, focus on ways to minimize the risks of the air pollution and exercise combination. 

To limit the effects of air pollution and exercise:

		Is air travel during pregnancy safe, especially near the beginning or end of pregnancy?
	","
Generally, commercial air travel during pregnancy is considered safe for women who have healthy pregnancies. Still, if you're pregnant, it's best to check with your health care provider before you fly. 

For women who have certain conditions — such as sickle cell disease, clotting disorders and placental insufficiency — air travel during pregnancy might increase the risk of complications. In addition, your health care provider might restrict travel of any type after 36 weeks of pregnancy or if you're at risk of preterm delivery.

If your health care provider approves air travel and you have flexibility in your travel plans, the best time to fly might be in the middle of your pregnancy — about weeks 14 to 28. This is when you're likely to feel your best, and the risks of miscarriage and premature labor are the lowest.

When you fly: 

Decreased air pressure during flight may slightly reduce the amount of oxygen in your blood, but this isn't likely to cause problems if you're otherwise healthy. Likewise, the radiation exposure associated with air travel at high altitudes isn't thought to be problematic for most business or leisure travelers. There's a caveat for frequent fliers, however. Pilots, flight attendants and others who fly often might be exposed to more radiation than is considered safe during pregnancy. If you must fly frequently during your pregnancy, discuss it with your health care provider. He or she might limit your total flight time during pregnancy.

Albuterol is commonly used for short-term relief of asthma symptoms. A type of medication known as a short-acting bronchodilator, it eases symptoms by opening the airways during an asthma flare-up. 

Albuterol is usually given with a metered dose inhaler (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and sometimes in tablet or liquid form. Albuterol side effects can include: 

More-serious — though less common — side effects include: 

Albuterol side effects are worse with the liquid or tablet form than with the inhaled form. Also, the risk of albuterol side effects increases with higher doses. 

To ease medication side effects, you may need to try a metered dose inhaler if you are taking the liquid or tablet form. Or it may be worthwhile to try a different quick-relief medication, such as the short-acting bronchodilator levalbuterol (Xopenex) or pirbuterol (Maxair). 

If you use albuterol three or more times a week or have severe asthma symptoms, you probably need to take a long-term asthma medication to better control your asthma. With asthma under better control, you won't need to use albuterol or another quick-relief medication as often.

		Does drinking alcohol affect your blood pressure?
	","
Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure to unhealthy levels. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increases your blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increases. 

Heavy drinkers who cut back to moderate drinking can lower their systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by 2 to 4 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and their diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number in a blood pressure reading) by 1 to 2 mm Hg. Heavy drinkers who want to lower blood pressure should slowly reduce how much they drink over one to two weeks. Heavy drinkers who stop suddenly risk developing severe high blood pressure for several days. 

If you have high blood pressure, avoid alcohol or drink alcohol only in moderation. Moderate drinking is generally considered to be: 

A drink is 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof distilled spirits. 

Keep in mind that alcohol contains calories and may contribute to unwanted weight gain — a risk factor for high blood pressure. Also, alcohol can interfere with the effectiveness and increase the side effects of some blood pressure medications.

I recently read a book that advocates a nutrition-based approach using supplements to treat alcoholism. The theory is that alcoholism is mainly a physiological problem and not a mental health problem. What is your opinion of this type of alcoholism treatment approach?,"Because people with alcoholism tend to eat poorly, a common-sense approach to good nutrition is an important part of alcoholism treatment. But there's no credible scientific evidence that any specific nutritional approach is a cure for alcoholism or even a critical part of the recovery process.Alcoholism is a complex illness influenced by genetic, psychological and social factors. When you become addicted to alcohol, irreversible biological changes occur in your brain, which impair your ability to control your use of alcohol. Even if you've been sober for years, a return to drinking can rapidly lead to impaired control and the biological, psychological and social consequences of alcoholism.Research has shown that there's no clear ""alcoholic personality"" that predisposes you to alcoholism. But addiction is very much a mental health problem — and, like all mental health problems, has physical as well as psychological components to it.Replacement of some specific vitamins and minerals may be important in treating nutritional deficiencies in some individuals. However, the most effective approach to alcoholism treatment involves reducing the shame and isolation that accompanies addiction, treating co-existing medical and psychiatric conditions, directly addressing the craving of alcohol, and creating sober, viable, social support networks."

In females with the gene defect, the disorder is mild — causing few, if any, signs or symptoms. Women can transmit the abnormal gene to their children, even if they have no signs or symptoms themselves. Male children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the defect from a mother who has the abnormal gene. In males, the signs and symptoms are more severe and progress at a faster rate.Signs and symptoms of Alport syndrome include:A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of Alport syndrome by:There's no cure for Alport syndrome. Treatment is directed at controlling blood pressure. In severe cases, kidney dialysis or transplantation may be needed."
"I'm a mountain climber. Many times, I've climbed to elevations above 8,000 feet, but I have no memory of reaching the peaks of these mountains afterwards. What causes this?","The higher you climb above sea level, the less oxygen you have to breathe. At altitudes above 8,000 feet (2,424 meters, or m), the oxygen level becomes very low. If you normally live at or near sea level, your body simply isn't used to working with so little oxygen. This is why mountain climbers, hikers and skiers who ascend too rapidly to altitudes above 8,000 feet (2,424 m) may be affected by altitude sickness — which can cause, among other symptoms, amnesia and memory loss.There are three main types of altitude illnesses:Amnesia or memory loss can occur in conjunction with all three types of altitude illness. This may be due to the effects of oxygen deficiency, low body temperature (hypothermia) or certain medications. Amnesia may also occur after return from altitudes above 16,500 feet (5,000 m).To avoid altitude illnesses, take the following steps:"
My mother-in-law has dementia and repeats the same questions over and over. What is the best way to respond?,"Repeating questions is a very common behavior in people with impaired memory. Some Alzheimer's caregivers cope with this problem by answering the question each time — recognizing that the interchange is simply a way for the confused person to seek reassurance. However, this requires tremendous patience.Another technique to try: If your mother-in-law has retained her ability to read, write the answer to the repeated question on an index card. Give the index card to your mother-in-law, and when she repeats the question, tell her — in a very matter-of-fact tone — to check the index card. After a number of reminders, your mother-in-law may eventually learn to check the card to receive reassurance, instead of repeating the question to you."

		Can exercise prevent memory loss and improve cognitive function?
	","
Yes, it might. Exercise has many known benefits, including reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, strengthening the bones and muscles, and reducing stress. It also appears that regular physical activity benefits the brain. Studies show that people who are physically active are less likely to experience a decline in their mental function and have a lowered risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Exercising several times a week for 30 to 60 minutes may: 

Physical activity seems to help the brain not only by keeping your blood flowing. It also increases chemicals that protect the brain and tends to counter some of the natural reduction in brain connections that occurs with aging.

More research is needed to know to what degree adding physical activity improves memory or slows the progression of cognitive decline. Nonetheless, regular exercise is important to stay physically and mentally fit.

"Is it true that Alzheimer's disease advances more slowly in people with higher IQs? My father, who is a Ph.D., has had this disease for nine years and can still function pretty well.","Not everyone with Alzheimer's disease will experience the same symptoms or progress at the same rate.Some researchers believe that people with higher IQs or advanced education are more resilient to dementia than are those with lower IQs or less education. Other researchers argue that advanced education gives a person more experience with the types of memory and thinking tests used to measure dementia. This advanced level of education simply may help some people hide their condition longer. As a result, by the time such a person is diagnosed, he or she may actually decline more rapidly because the disease is more advanced at that point.There's no evidence that high IQ or advanced education increases life span or survival rates in people with Alzheimer's disease."

		I recently heard about a new Alzheimer's treatment, a nose spray containing insulin. How does it work and is there an Alzheimer's nose spray available?
	","
Insulin — a hormone that helps regulate your blood sugar — appears to play a role in normal memory processes. Insulin irregularities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. 

In the past several years, researchers have been investigating the use of insulin to treat Alzheimer's disease. One of the challenges is how to provide insulin in such a way that it improves brain function without disrupting your blood sugar levels. If your blood sugar drops too low, for example, it can create complications, such as confusion, heart palpitations, anxiety and visual disturbances. 

Preliminary research suggests that when taken as a nose spray, insulin reaches the brain within a few minutes and improves memory. However, this research involved small groups of participants who had either early Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. Although this research is promising, more research on the safety and effectiveness of intranasal insulin therapy for Alzheimer's disease is necessary.

According to an April 2010 statement from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a number of factors could play a role in whether you develop Alzheimer's disease. However, more research is needed before modifying any of these factors can be proven to prevent Alzheimer's.

The NIH report was developed by an independent panel of health professionals and public representatives who reviewed the most current research on Alzheimer's prevention. The panel found that studies to date have varied too much in size, scope, criteria and definitions to compare results and draw reliable conclusions.

An important first step in developing a treatment plan for any disease is having a clear diagnosis. New Alzheimer's tests may help with early detection of the disease. However, before these become widely available, more research is needed to determine who might benefit from them and what they reveal about the progression of Alzheimer's and other diseases. 

Early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is an important goal. Early intervention with medications may slow the progression of the disease and provide a better opportunity to plan for the future.

		Can a head injury cause or hasten Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia?
	","
The immediate effects of a head injury can include dementia symptoms, such as confusion, memory loss, and changes in speech, vision and personality. Depending on the severity of your injury, these symptoms may clear up quickly, last a long time or never go away completely. However, such symptoms that begin soon after your injury generally don't get worse over time as happens with Alzheimer's disease.

Certain types of head injuries, however, may increase your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or other dementias later in life. The greatest increase in future dementia risk seems to occur after a severe head injury that knocks you out for more than 24 hours. A moderately serious head injury that causes unconsciousness for more than 30 minutes, but less than 24 hours, also seems to increase risk to a smaller extent.

There's no evidence that a single mild head injury that doesn't knock you out, or that knocks you out for less than 30 minutes, increases your risk of dementia. However, repeated mild injuries may increase risk of future problems with thinking and reasoning. 

You're likely at greatest risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's later in life, post-head injury, if you also have other risk factors. For example, carrying one form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene increases the risk of Alzheimer's in any individual. A head injury in such a person would increase his or her risk further. 

It's important to note that many people who sustain a severe head injury never develop Alzheimer's disease or later dementia. More research is needed to understand the link.

		Can a Mediterranean diet lower my risk of Alzheimer's?
	","
You may know that a Mediterranean diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, olive oil, legumes, whole grains and fish — offers heart-healthy benefits. But a Mediterranean diet may also benefit your brain. Studies show that people who closely follow a Mediterranean diet seem less likely to develop cognitive decline when compared with people who don't follow the diet.

Research shows that a Mediterranean diet may: 

It's unclear why following a Mediterranean diet may protect brain function. Researchers speculate that making healthy food choices may improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels and overall blood vessel health — all factors that may reduce the risk of MCI or Alzheimer's disease.

Studies of the effects of diet on dementia are dependent on the recall of the participants — problematic when some of those studied have memory troubles. More research is needed to know to what degree a Mediterranean diet prevents Alzheimer's or slows the progression of cognitive decline. Nonetheless, eating a healthy diet is important to stay physically and mentally fit.

		My doctor prescribed Ambien, and it's worked great for me. But I'm afraid I might become dependent on it. Is that likely?
	","
It's unlikely you'll become dependent on zolpidem (Ambien). Ambien and similar sleep medications are effective and much less likely to be habit-forming than are some other drugs sometimes prescribed for sleep problems — for example, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan) or temazepam (Restoril).

However, relying on a sleep medication generally isn't the best long-term solution for insomnia. Medications can mask an underlying problem that needs treatment. They can also cause side effects. 

For example, some people who take Ambien and similar medications such as eszopiclone (Lunesta) do things while asleep that they don't remember — such as driving, or preparing and eating food. Because you're not awake, these are dangerous behaviors. In rare cases, these medications may trigger a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Some recent studies suggest possible links between certain sleep medications and increased risk of death and cancer, but much more work needs to be done to sort out these relationships.

Sleep medications can be useful in the short term — but the best approach is to address whatever's causing your sleep problems in the first place. If you still have trouble sleeping, other therapies include learning new sleep habits (such as keeping your bedtime and wake time consistent from day to day), getting counseling for anxiety or other psychological concerns, and using stress-reduction techniques.

Another type (lymphangiosarcoma) may occur in people with chronic lymphedema in an arm or leg. Doctors refer to this rare condition as Stewart-Treves syndrome.Angiosarcomas typically cause no signs or symptoms in the early stages. As a tumor grows, it may cause a lump or swelling. Later it may cause pain if it presses on nerves or muscles. A doctor may suspect an angiosarcoma based on:The only way to confirm a diagnosis is by a biopsy of affected tissue. Early-stage treatment often includes surgical removal of the tumor combined with chemotherapy and radiation. In later stages of the disease, treatment is more difficult. But it may include chemotherapy and, in some cases, radiation therapy. Prognosis depends on stage of disease. If the cancer is localized, the prognosis is very favorable."

		What causes ankle swelling during pregnancy — and what can I do about it?
	","
Various factors contribute to foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy. For starters, your body produces and retains more fluid during pregnancy. Also, your growing uterus puts pressure on your veins, which impairs return of blood to your heart. In turn, this can lead to swelling in the legs, ankles and feet. Hormonal changes might play a role as well. 

Foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy is common and usually goes away after delivery. In the meantime, it might help to: 

In addition, some research suggests that regular foot massages might help decrease foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy. 

Although mild foot and ankle swelling during pregnancy is normal, extreme swelling during pregnancy can be a red flag. Contact your health care provider if you have: 

Severe or sudden swelling could be a sign of a serious condition called preeclampsia. Other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia include severe headaches, blurred vision and rapid weight gain. Swelling in only one leg — especially if it's accompanied by pain or tenderness in the calf or thigh — could indicate a blood clot or other underlying condition. Both conditions warrant prompt evaluation and treatment.

		Could ankle weights help me get more out of my usual walking routine?
	","
Ankle weights generally aren't recommended for brisk walking. 

Although ankle weights can increase the energy you burn while walking, they may strain the ankle joint and leg muscles, which could increase your risk of injury. 

To get more out of your walking routine, simply try picking up the pace. If you're in good shape, add short bursts of jogging into your regular brisk walks. If you're less fit, alternate leisurely walking with periods of faster walking. For example, if you're walking outdoors, you could walk faster between certain mailboxes, trees or other landmarks. 

If you'd like to include strength training in your fitness routine, you have plenty of options besides weights. For example, consider resistance tubing — these elastic-like tubes offer weight-like resistance when you pull on them. Your own body weight counts, too. Try pushups, pullups, abdominal crunches and leg squats.

		What are the effects of drinking alcohol while taking antibiotics?
	","
Antibiotics and alcohol can cause similar side effects, such as stomach upset, dizziness and drowsiness. Combining antibiotics and alcohol can increase these side effects.

A few antibiotics — such as metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) — should not be mixed with alcohol because this may result in a more severe reaction. Drinking any amount of alcohol with these medications can result in side effects such as flushing, headache, nausea and vomiting, and rapid heart rate.

Keep in mind that some cold medicines and mouthwashes also contain alcohol. So check the label and avoid such products while taking these antibiotics.

Although alcohol doesn't reduce the effectiveness of most antibiotics, it can reduce your energy and delay how quickly you recover from illness. So, it's a good idea to avoid alcohol until you finish your antibiotics and are feeling better.

		Is it safe to take antibiotics during pregnancy?
	","
Antibiotics are commonly prescribed during pregnancy. The specific medication must be chosen carefully, however. Some antibiotics are OK to take during pregnancy, while others are not. Safety depends on various factors, including the type of antibiotic, when in your pregnancy you take the antibiotic, how much you take and for how long.

Here's a sampling of antibiotics generally considered safe during pregnancy:

Certain other antibiotics should be avoided during pregnancy. For example, tetracyclines — such as doxycycline and minocycline — can damage a pregnant woman's liver and discolor a developing baby's teeth.

In addition, it's important to note that two classes of antibiotics commonly used to treat urinary tract infections — nitrofuran derivatives and sulfonamides — have been associated with rare birth defects. Although there's no direct proof that these antibiotics cause birth defects, additional research is needed. In the meantime, use of these medications is still warranted in some cases.

If an antibiotic is the best way to treat your condition, your health care provider will prescribe the safest antibiotic at the safest dosage.

		If you stop taking antidepressants, could you experience antidepressant withdrawal? Do withdrawal symptoms mean you were addicted to the drug?
	","
Antidepressant withdrawal is possible if you abruptly stop taking an antidepressant, particularly if you've been taking it longer than six weeks. Symptoms of antidepressant withdrawal are sometimes called antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.

Quitting an antidepressant suddenly may cause symptoms such as:

Certain antidepressants are more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than others. If you have any concerns about withdrawal symptoms, talk with your doctor.

Having antidepressant withdrawal symptoms doesn't mean you're addicted to an antidepressant. Addiction represents harmful, long-term chemical changes in the brain. It's characterized by intense cravings and the inability to control your use of a substance. Antidepressants don't cause these issues, and you can't become addicted to them.

To minimize the risk of antidepressant withdrawal, talk with your doctor before you stop taking an antidepressant. Your doctor may recommend that you gradually reduce the dose of your antidepressant for several weeks to allow your brain to adapt to the absence of the drug.

In some cases, another antidepressant or other type of medication is prescribed on a short-term basis to help ease symptoms as your body adjusts. If you're switching from one type of antidepressant to another, your doctor may have you start taking the new one before you completely stop taking the original medication.

It's sometimes difficult to tell the difference between withdrawal symptoms and returning depression symptoms after you stop taking an antidepressant. Keep your doctor informed of your signs and symptoms. If your depression symptoms return, your doctor may recommend that you begin taking an antidepressant again or that you get other treatment.

Is it true that antioxidant supplements may help prevent heart disease?,"Much research has been done to evaluate the potential role of antioxidant supplements in preventing heart disease. But there is no conclusive evidence to support this possible benefit.Antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and beta carotene, are substances found naturally in many foods. They are also available as supplements. Although antioxidants have some health-promoting properties, it isn't clear if antioxidant supplements offer the same benefits as food sources do.Antioxidants slow oxidation, a natural process that leads to cell and tissue damage. It is believed that oxidation plays a role in the development of fatty deposits in the walls of blood vessels (atherosclerosis), which increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.Although some early research suggested that taking antioxidant supplements could prevent this process, more recent studies have found no beneficial effect. Some studies even suggest that antioxidant supplements — which contain antioxidants at levels thousands of times higher than those in food sources — have harmful effects. For example, recent analysis of several previous studies of vitamin E suggests that people who take more than 400 international units of vitamin E a day may be at increased risk of death.For these reasons, the American Heart Association doesn't recommend routine use of antioxidant supplements to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. Instead, it supports a diet high in food sources of antioxidants and other heart-protecting nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."

		Does aortic valve calcification increase the risk of heart disease?
	","
Aortic valve calcification is a condition in which calcium deposits form on the aortic valve in the heart. These deposits can cause narrowing at the opening of the aortic valve. This narrowing can progress to become severe enough to reduce blood flow through the aortic valve, a condition called aortic valve stenosis. 

Aortic valve calcification may be an early sign that you have heart disease, even if you don't have any other heart disease symptoms. 

Calcification and stenosis typically affect people older than age 65. When it occurs in younger people, it's often caused by: 

Aortic valve sclerosis — thickening and stiffness of the valve — and mild aortic calcification usually don't cause significant heart problems, but require regular checkups to make sure your condition isn't worsening. It's important to have your cholesterol checked because you may need medications to lower cholesterol and help prevent aortic valve sclerosis from getting worse. If the valve becomes severely narrowed (stenotic), aortic valve replacement surgery may be necessary. 
"
How does aortic regurgitation affect blood pressure?,"The aortic valve separates the left pumping chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the aorta, the large blood vessel that supplies blood to the rest of your body. When the aortic valve functions properly, it allows blood to be pumped out of the heart and into the aorta and supports blood pressure in the aorta between heartbeats.If the aortic valve doesn't close tightly (aortic regurgitation), some of the blood that has already been pumped out of the heart leaks back in (regurgitation). The heart tries to make up for the problem by pumping out larger amounts of blood with each heartbeat. This causes a decrease in diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, resulting in an increase in pulse pressure — the numeric difference between systolic and diastolic pressure."

		What's the relationship between arcus senilis and high cholesterol?
	","
Arcus senilis (AHR-kus see-NIL-us) and the eye problems caused by high cholesterol are different.

Arcus senilis, also known as arcus cornealis, is a gray or white arc visible above and below the outer part of the cornea — the clear, dome-like covering over the front of the eye. Eventually, the arc may become a complete ring around the cornea.

Arcus senilis is common in older adults. It's caused by fat (lipid) deposits deep in the edge of the cornea. It isn't related to high cholesterol, however. Arcus senilis doesn't affect vision, nor does it require treatment.

Eye problems caused by high cholesterol are uncommon — typically affecting only people who have severe cases of high cholesterol and high triglycerides passed down through families (familial hyperlipidemia). High cholesterol is more likely associated with a similar gray or white arc visible around the entire cornea (circumferential arcus) in younger adults. Treatment is generally aimed at controlling cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

The average person who has high cholesterol doesn't develop an arc of any type. If you're concerned about eye health and high cholesterol, talk to your doctor.

You don't necessarily need probiotics — a type of ""good"" bacteria — to be healthy. However, these microorganisms may help with digestion and offer protection from harmful bacteria, just as the existing ""good"" bacteria in your body already do. 

Prebiotics are nondigestible carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics. When probiotics and prebiotics are combined, they form a synbiotic. Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, are considered synbiotic because they contain live bacteria and the fuel they need to thrive.

Probiotics are found in foods such as yogurt, while prebiotics are found in whole grains, bananas, onions, garlic, honey and artichokes. In addition, probiotics and prebiotics are added to some foods and available as dietary supplements.

Although more research is needed, there's encouraging evidence that probiotics may help:

Research on the effectiveness of aromatherapy — the therapeutic use of essential oils extracted from plants — is limited. However, some studies have shown that aromatherapy might have health benefits, including:

Essential oils used in aromatherapy are typically extracted from various parts of plants and then distilled. The highly concentrated oils may be inhaled directly or indirectly or applied to the skin through massage, lotions or bath salts. Aromatherapy is thought to work by stimulating smell receptors in the nose, which then send messages through the nervous system to the limbic system — the part of the brain that controls emotions.

Many essential oils have been shown to be safe when used as directed. However, essential oils used in aromatherapy aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. When applied to the skin, side effects may include allergic reactions, skin irritation and sun sensitivity. In addition, further research is needed to determine how essential oils might affect children and how the oils might affect women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, as well as how the oils might interact with medications and other treatments.

If you're considering aromatherapy, consult your doctor and a trained aromatherapist about the possible risks and benefits.

I don't like taking so much medication, and I'm wondering if I can cut back and only take medication on days that I have pain.","If you are using an over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen, you can generally adjust the amount you are taking to match your level of pain. This is especially true if the severity of your pain varies. For example, some people experience a flare of arthritis symptoms after increased physical activity. Using the full recommended dose of a medication for several days should help decrease pain and inflammation. When symptoms improve, you can cut back to one or two tablets every few days. If your symptoms don't recur, you can stop taking the medication and just take it when you need it.On the other hand, if your arthritis symptoms are more constant, you may find that staying on a set dosage of the medication all the time provides maximum relief of symptoms. This is because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be taken for several days to achieve a consistent and adequate level of medication in your blood. For this reason, taking an NSAID only when you have pain won't be as effective as taking the medication on a regular basis.If you are taking a prescription arthritis medication, discuss any possible dosage adjustments with your doctor."

The risk appears to be most significant if you already have high blood pressure or other risk factors for heart disease, but more studies are needed before we can be sure.

Other over-the-counter (OTC) arthritis medications — specifically, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others) — also are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. More is known about how — and to what degree — these drugs affect your heart, blood vessels and blood pressure. You need to be especially careful about using these drugs if you've had a heart attack or are at risk of heart attack, as they increase your risk and interfere with the preventive effects of aspirin. 

NSAIDs also increase the risk of bleeding. This is a particular concern for people who have heart disease and are already taking aspirin and other medications that increase bleeding risk, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) or warfarin (Coumadin). In addition, because NSAIDs cause fluid retention, people with heart failure should avoid them. 

Keep in mind that medication isn't the only treatment for arthritis pain. Mild to moderate arthritis pain may be relieved with a combination of self-care measures and lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, exercise, heat or cold therapy, and physical therapy. Many doctors recommend trying this combined approach before starting medication.

If you need medication to help manage your arthritis pain, use the lowest dose necessary for the shortest time possible. Also, discuss with your doctor which pain medication is most appropriate for your specific situation. All medications — prescription and nonprescription — have risks and potential side effects. 

When taking OTC pain relievers for arthritis, keep these tips in mind:

		Can I use artificial sweeteners if I have diabetes?
	","
You can use most artificial sweeteners if you have diabetes, including: 

Artificial sweeteners, also called sugar substitutes, offer the sweetness of sugar without the calories. Artificial sweeteners are many times sweeter than sugar, so it takes a smaller amount to sweeten foods. This is why foods made with artificial sweeteners may have fewer calories than those made with sugar. 

Artificial sweeteners don't affect your blood sugar level. In fact, most artificial sweeteners are considered ""free foods"" because they don't count as a carbohydrate, a fat or any other diabetes exchange. Remember, however, other ingredients in foods containing artificial sweeteners can still affect your blood sugar level. 

Also, be cautious with sugar alcohols — including mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol. Sugar alcohols can increase your blood sugar level. And for some people, sugar alcohols cause diarrhea.

		I have dry eyes. What should I look for when selecting artificial tears?
	","
Artificial tears are eyedrops used to lubricate dry eyes and help maintain moisture on the outer surface of your eyes. Artificial tears may be used to treat dry eyes that result from aging, certain medications, a medical condition, eye surgery or environmental factors, such as smoky or windy conditions. Artificial tears are available without a prescription. There isn't a single brand of artificial tears that works best for every form of dry eyes.

In addition to providing lubricating moisture, some artificial tears contain electrolytes, such as potassium and bicarbonate. These additives may promote healing of the surface of the eyes. Artificial tears may also contain thickening agents, which keep the solution on the surface of your eyes longer.

There are two basic types of artificial tears:

In addition to over-the-counter artificial tears, you may also get relief from gels, gel inserts and ointments. Artificial tear ointments may offer longer lasting relief but may cause blurred vision and, as such, may work best just before bedtime.

If artificial tears don't help in relieving your dry eyes, make an appointment with an eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist). He or she may be able to offer another treatment for your dry eyes.

What is aspergillosis?,"Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic reaction caused by aspergillus — a mold (fungus) found in the environment, such as in decaying vegetation and household dust. In healthy individuals, it rarely causes problems. But aspergillus may affect people with asthma or weakened immune systems.An aspergillus skin test can determine whether someone has been exposed to aspergillus. It's performed by injecting an aspergillus antigen under the skin. Inflammation at the injection site indicates past exposure to aspergillus.Aspergillus can cause illness in several ways, including:ABPA is an allergic lung reaction that often mimics pneumonia. Signs and symptoms include:A doctor may make a diagnosis of ABPA by:Treatment may include oral prednisone.Signs and symptoms of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis include:The infection can spread to other organs, such as the skin, eyes, heart, brain and kidneys. Diagnosis and treatment are difficult. A doctor may suspect invasive pulmonary aspergillosis based on a chest X-ray or CT scan or by a sputum stain and culture. A diagnosis may be confirmed by a biopsy of infected tissue. Treatment usually includes antifungal medications."

		I think I may have an aspirin allergy. What are the symptoms?
	","
Reactions to aspirin are common. If you have an aspirin allergy or sensitivity, you may also have a reaction to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others). 

An aspirin allergy or sensitivity, or a reaction to another NSAID, can cause symptoms that range from mild to severe. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of taking the medication. They may include: 

If you have asthma, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis or chronic hives (urticaria), you're at increased risk of having a reaction to aspirin or other NSAIDs. When a reaction occurs, it can worsen symptoms of these conditions. 

Having asthma or another of these conditions doesn't guarantee you'll have a reaction, or that you should avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs to prevent one. However, if you've ever had a reaction to an NSAID, it's best to avoid all NSAIDs — whether you have one of these conditions or not. 

Keep in mind that aspirin and other NSAIDs are found in many over-the-counter medications — so check labels carefully. When in doubt about whether a medication contains an NSAID, ask your doctor or pharmacist about it. It may be OK for you to use acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) as an alternative, but check with your doctor first to make sure it's safe for you. 

Consult your doctor if you have any medication reaction, particularly if it's severe. For a serious reaction, you may need to see a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating this type of reaction (allergist/immunologist).

		Is it safe to take aspirin during pregnancy?
	","
Generally, aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) aren't recommended as pain relievers during pregnancy. 

Aspirin interferes with your blood's clotting action. As a result, taking aspirin during pregnancy — especially after 32 weeks — can contribute to maternal and fetal bleeding. Aspirin and ibuprofen can also cause the premature closure of a vessel in a baby's heart, which can lead to high blood pressure in the baby's lungs (pulmonary hypertension), and prolong labor. 

However, low-dose aspirin therapy is sometimes prescribed during pregnancy to help treat medical conditions. If you need to take aspirin during your third trimester of pregnancy, your health care provider will likely closely monitor you and your baby. 

If you need to take a pain reliever during pregnancy, ask your health care provider about the options. He or she might approve occasional use of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).

		Is there a connection between asthma and acid reflux?
	","
Asthma and acid reflux often occur together. It isn't clear why, or whether one causes the other. What we do know is that acid reflux can worsen asthma — and asthma can worsen acid reflux. This can be particularly true if you have severe acid reflux, a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

Asthma and acid reflux can occur together in children as well as in adults. In fact, about half the children with asthma also have GERD. 

When asthma and acid reflux do occur together, asthma medications may not work as well to control signs and symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath. Likewise, asthma may worsen acid reflux signs and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and chest pain. 

Treating acid reflux may help ease symptoms caused by either condition. You may be able to control acid reflux with over-the-counter medications — for example, a proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole (Prilosec). Avoiding reflux triggers such as fatty foods, alcohol and tobacco also may help. If that's not enough, prescription medications may be needed. In severe cases, surgery is sometimes necessary. 

Talk to your doctor if you or your child has frequent asthma flare-ups. You may need to adjust asthma-control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids or take other steps to control asthma symptoms. 

In some cases, asthma medications can worsen acid reflux. This is particularly true of theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, others). But don't quit taking or change any asthma medications without getting your doctor's OK first. 

If you or your child is diagnosed with acid reflux, asthma or both, getting the right treatment will help ease symptoms — and it may help prevent health problems associated with either condition.

There's no asthma diet that will eliminate your symptoms. But these steps may help: 

It's also possible that eating less salt (sodium) or eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (oils found in cold water fish and some nuts and seeds) may reduce asthma symptoms. But more research is needed to verify this. 

Making informed choices about what foods to eat and what foods to avoid won't cure asthma. But it may improve your symptoms and your overall health.

How does pregnancy affect asthma?,"The effects of pregnancy on asthma aren't predictable. Your asthma may be unaffected, worse or improved in pregnancy. Sometimes asthma gets worse in the third trimester or during labor and delivery. Women with moderate to severe asthma are at increased risk of an asthma attack during pregnancy and delivery. It's important to maintain good control of your asthma in pregnancy to minimize problems.Poorly controlled asthma poses a health threat to both the mother and the fetus. Severe asthma attacks cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen in the mother's blood. This leads to decreased oxygen supply to the fetus, which can result in lower fetal weight gain. Because of this concern, a pregnant woman is more likely to receive treatment with oxygen during an acute asthma attack. Your doctor may also advise lung function tests and arterial blood gas studies during an acute attack.Many women feel uneasy about taking medications during pregnancy. But if you have asthma, it's important to control the signs and symptoms. If you become pregnant, don't stop taking your asthma medications. Some tips for managing asthma in pregnancy include:Also, asthma shouldn't interfere with your ability to do Lamaze breathing techniques."

		My daughter has asthma. Should we replace the carpeting in our home with vinyl or wood flooring?
	","
Reducing exposure to asthma triggers is one of the most important steps you can take to prevent asthma flare-ups. 

Carpeting can be a reservoir for allergy-causing substances (allergens) that trigger asthma. Carpeting in the bedroom can be especially problematic because it exposes you to carpet dust throughout the night. Hard-surface flooring such as vinyl, tile or wood is much easier to keep free of dust mites, pollen, pet dander and other allergens. 

Steam cleaning carpet on a regular basis can help reduce the presence of dust mites and other allergens in your home. If that isn't enough, replacing carpeting with hard flooring may be a good idea. 

If you do put in hard flooring, keep in mind that all synthetic flooring initially releases gasses known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can worsen asthma. In most cases, products stop releasing VOCs after several days. However, some release more VOCs than others. You may want to look into low-VOC flooring if this is a concern. 

It might be worthwhile having your daughter see an allergist for allergy skin testing. There may be individualized steps you can take to reduce allergen exposure once you know exactly what your daughter is allergic to.

		Is it possible to have asthma without wheezing?
	","
Yes, it's possible to have asthma without wheezing. 

A wheeze is a whistling sound produced by air flowing through a narrowed airway. Although a wheeze occurs primarily on exhaling, it can be heard on inhaling as well. Wheezing is a common sign of asthma, particularly in children. However, asthma doesn't always produce a wheeze you can hear. Instead, other signs and symptoms of asthma may be more prominent. These can include: 

These signs and symptoms of asthma may get worse during play or exercise. A cold or other respiratory infection also can make asthma symptoms more noticeable. 

If you suspect you or your child may have asthma, see a doctor to have it checked out. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent asthma from getting worse, and can help you or your child avoid a bad asthma attack. 

When you see the doctor, be prepared to answer very specific questions. When considering a diagnosis, the doctor will want to know as much as possible about any unusual breathing sounds or other possible signs of asthma. 

In older children and adults, lung function tests can be used to make an asthma diagnosis. Children usually don't develop the skills to take these tests until they're about 4 years old, so asthma diagnosis in younger children is generally based on what a parent notices and tells the doctor. 

While not all unusual breathing sounds are a sign of asthma or another underlying health condition that needs treatment, see the doctor to make sure.

		Why do my asthma symptoms seem to get worse during my period?
	","
Just before and during your period, levels of progesterone and estrogen decrease. In some women, these hormone changes may worsen asthma. The relationship between hormones and asthma is complex, varies between individuals and isn't fully understood.

Along with women's menstrual cycles, other things that cause changes in hormone levels may also worsen or improve asthma symptoms. These include: 

If you have bothersome asthma symptoms during your period, your doctor may recommend that you increase your asthma control medication or take a different medication before your period starts.

		Do atypical cells usually mean cancer?
	","
Atypical cells are cells that appear abnormal under a microscope, but they aren't necessarily cancerous. The presence of atypical cells is sometimes referred to as ""dysplasia."" Many factors can make normal cells appear atypical, including inflammation and infection. Even normal aging can make cells appear abnormal. 

Atypical cells can change back to normal cells if the underlying cause is removed or resolved. This can happen spontaneously. Or it can be the result of a specific treatment. 

Atypical cells don't necessarily mean you have cancer. However, it's still important to make sure there's no cancer present or that a cancer isn't just starting to develop. 

If your doctor identifies atypical cells, close follow-up is essential. In some cases, your doctor may simply monitor the atypical cells to make sure they don't become more abnormal. Other tests or scans may be useful, depending on your specific circumstances. In other cases, your doctor may recommend a particular treatment to try to reverse the process that's causing the atypical cells. And sometimes, your doctor may need to obtain a sample of tissue — such as a biopsy — to make sure you don't have cancer or another serious condition.

		Is chelation therapy an effective autism treatment?
	","
Chelation therapy is not an effective autism treatment, and it may be dangerous.

Some doctors and parents have considered chelation therapy as a potential autism treatment. Proponents believe that autism is caused by mercury exposure, such as from childhood vaccines. Chelation therapy supposedly removes mercury from the body, which chelation supporters say cures autism — but there's no evidence of a link between mercury exposure and autism. In addition, chelation therapy can be associated with serious side effects, including potentially deadly liver and kidney damage.

There's no cure for autism. As a result, many unproven alternative therapies are often suggested. However, these alternative therapies are usually found to be ineffective and sometimes harmful.

		Can special diets help children who have autism?
	","
There's no evidence that special diets are an effective autism treatment.

Some people believe that diets that are free of a protein found in dairy products (casein) and a protein found in many grains (gluten) affect the brain development and behavior that causes autism in children. However, there's little evidence that diet triggers autism or that restricting gluten and casein improves autism symptoms. And for growing children, restrictive diets can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Research is ongoing on the effectiveness of casein- and gluten-free diets.

Autism is a complex brain disorder that has no known cure. For this reason, many frustrated parents turn to unproven alternative treatments — such as restrictive diets that eliminate gluten and casein — in an attempt to help their children.

If you're considering an alternative autism treatment, talk to your child's doctor. He or she can help you identify the treatments that are most likely to be effective for your child, as well as local resources that may provide additional support. If you decide to pursue a restrictive diet, work with a registered dietitian to create an appropriate meal plan for your child.

Two children with the same diagnosis may share certain patterns of behavior but can exhibit a wide range of skills and abilities.A child with an autistic spectrum disorder may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, then become less responsive to other people. These disorders can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years, and in some cases as early as 18 months. Still, it's estimated that only 50 percent of children with autistic spectrum disorders are diagnosed before kindergarten. Delayed speech is one common indicator of such a disorder. However, it's important to note that not all children with delayed speech have an autistic spectrum disorder.Doctors and researchers don't understand what causes autistic spectrum disorders. But they seem to have a strong genetic component. They also may be associated with abnormalities in certain parts of the brain. Researchers are aggressively exploring these theories and others.Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of autistic spectrum disorders are still evolving. But early interventions and special education are already helping many children. If you have concerns about your child's speech and language or social development, discuss them with your doctor."

		I've heard the news that the Food and Drug Administration has restricted the use of Avandia. I currently take this drug — what do I do?
	","
If you're currently taking or considering the drug, Avandia, the news regarding the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) increased restrictions on Avandia should prompt you to talk with your doctor about what's best for you as soon as possible. Avandia will no longer be available in retail pharmacies as of November 2011. 

Avandia — which belongs to a class of drugs known as thiazolidinediones — is one of many oral medications designed to control blood sugar in those with diabetes. Avandia lowers the amount of sugar in your blood by making your tissues more sensitive to insulin, a hormone that regulates the absorption of sugar into your cells. 

Avandia has been linked to serious risks, including the FDA's primary concern — an increased risk of heart attack. 

Initial FDA restrictions still allow the use of Avandia if: 

The FDA requires your doctor to provide you a copy of the Avandia medication guide and review it with you. The FDA also requires that you and your doctor enroll in a program — the Avandia-rosiglitazone Medicines Access Program — to be able to receive and prescribe this medication. After November 18, 2011, you'll no longer be able to obtain Avandia at retail pharmacies. It will only be available to you by mail, from pharmacies enrolled in the program. 

If Avandia is part of your diabetes treatment plan, continue taking the drug as prescribed until you have the opportunity to talk to your doctor. Although an increased risk of heart attack is nothing to take lightly, the risk isn't considered an emergency. It's much riskier to stop taking a diabetes medication on your own.

		What is the best way to treat an avulsion fracture in a young athlete?
	","
An avulsion fracture occurs when a tendon or ligament, along with a piece of the bone it's attached to, gets pulled away from the main part of the bone. Avulsion fractures in young athletes often involve tendons that attach the hamstring muscle to one of the pelvic bones, the hip flexor muscles to the pelvis or thighbone, or the inner forearm muscles to the inner side of the elbow.

Conservative treatment — resting and icing the affected area, then doing controlled exercises to stretch the tendon and promote bone healing — is usually all that's needed for an avulsion fracture to heal. If the hip muscles are affected, however, you may need to spend a few weeks on crutches. Complete recovery can take from four to eight weeks. 

If the bone fragment and main bone are too far apart to fuse naturally, surgery may be necessary to reunite them — particularly for hamstring avulsion fractures. Surgery also may be necessary later to remove the painful, fibrous tissue (soft tissue union) that sometimes forms around unhealed fractures. In children, avulsion fractures that occur on a growth plate also may require surgery.

The vast majority of avulsion fractures heal very well without surgical intervention, but be sure to talk to your doctor about the best treatment for your specific injury.

		I've heard about an Alzheimer's supplement called Axona. What does it do, and can it really treat Alzheimer's?
	","
Axona is a prescription dietary supplement that claims to target the nutritional needs of people with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is thought to hinder the brain's ability to break down glucose. According to Axona's marketing materials, the supplement provides an alternative energy source that the brain can use instead of glucose.

It's not clear what benefits, if any, Axona provides. A small study, funded by the manufacturers of the product, found that memory and cognition improved for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. However, more studies are needed to determine its safety and effectiveness. 

Axona is marketed as a medical food. Medical foods are dietary supplements that help manage a disease or condition that causes nutritional deficiencies. The Alzheimer's Association, however, disputes the notion that Alzheimer's disease causes nutritional deficiencies and requires a medical food. Medical foods are given only under the supervision of a doctor. But the Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve medical foods, nor does it test medical foods for safety or effectiveness.

Until more is known, the Alzheimer's Association doesn't recommend the use of medical foods, including Axona, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

		Does ""baby brain"" really exist?
	","
There isn't enough information to support the existence of baby brain — a term used to describe the idea that pregnancy or early motherhood can harm a woman's memory and ability to think.

Researchers began studying the theory of baby brain because women frequently report cognitive changes, particularly forgetfulness, during pregnancy and shortly after becoming mothers. Studies examining the relationship between pregnancy or early motherhood and changes in a woman's ability to think, however, have produced conflicting results. Some studies have shown that pregnancy impairs a woman's memory during pregnancy and shortly afterward, possibly due to hormonal changes, sleep deprivation or the stress of coping with a major life change. However, other research has shown that pregnancy and motherhood have no negative cognitive impacts.

Because the concept of baby brain is so widely accepted, some experts suggest that pregnant women and new mothers are more aware of everyday cognitive slips. As a result, they mistakenly perceive themselves as having trouble thinking.

If you're pregnant or a new mother, don't assume that you're experiencing a cognitive decline. Keep in mind that becoming a mother involves an emotional and physical transition. While you're adjusting, focus on the positive aspects of pregnancy, motherhood and the journey ahead.

		Is it OK to play Baby Einstein DVDs for my 6-month-old? I've heard that such programming can promote a child's development.
	","
Baby Einstein DVDs might catch your baby's attention, but screen time isn't likely to promote his or her development. In fact, an infant can learn just as much — if not more — by interacting with you or other caregivers. 

Research examining the specific effects of baby DVDs and other infant programming is limited. In a 2007 study, children ages 8 months to 16 months who were exposed to baby DVDs scored lower on a language development test than did babies who had no screen time. A 2009 study of children ages 2 months to 4 years showed that turning on the television reduced verbal interaction between parents and children — which may delay language development. In addition, a 2010 study found no evidence that children ages 1 to 2 learned words highlighted in a Baby Einstein DVD. In contrast, research has shown that regularly reading to young children boosts language ability for both babies and toddlers. 

Many pediatricians discourage screen time for children younger than age 2. Instead of relying on Baby Einstein DVDs, concentrate on proven ways to promote infant development — such as talking, playing, singing and reading to your baby. Even if your baby doesn't understand what you're saying or grasp the plot of a story, he or she will soak in your words and revel in your attention. These simple activities form the foundation for speech and thought. 

Still, Baby Einstein DVDs aren't necessarily off-limits. If your family enjoys this kind of programming, make conscious decisions about how to use it. Turn it on only occasionally — and encourage interaction by watching the programming together.

		How would I know if my baby is too heavy?
	","
If you're concerned about your baby's weight or body composition — too much ""baby fat"" — be sure to consult your baby's doctor regularly. Growth, development and weight are great topics to discuss during routine well-child visits. 

Since infants tend to carry different amounts of weight at different stages of development, making judgments about baby fat on the basis of appearance alone isn't reliable or effective. 

Instead, your baby's doctor will plot your baby's growth on charts that show measurements for height, weight, head circumference and body mass index (BMI). You can use the charts to compare your baby's growth with that of other infants of the same sex and age. 

Remember, though, what matters more is the trend revealed on growth charts — not any particular percentile. Your baby's doctor will look mainly for predictable changes in weight over time. 

Also, keep in mind that babies need a diet high in fat to support growth during infancy. In fact, a baby who's exclusively breast-fed gets about half of his or her daily calories from the fat in breast milk. 

Excess fat and calories can still be a concern, though. For example, being too heavy can delay crawling and walking — essential parts of a baby's physical and mental development. 

To help prevent excess baby fat: 

As your child gets older, continue talking to his or her doctor about weight and nutrition. For additional guidance, you might consult a registered dietitian as well.

		Is baby sign language worthwhile?
	","
Baby sign language can be an effective communication tool for infants and young children. 

Limited research suggests that using baby sign language may improve a child's ability to communicate and ease frustration, particularly between ages 8 months and 2 years. During this period, children begin to know what they want, need and feel, but they don't necessarily have the verbal skills to express themselves. Baby sign language allows children to use their hands to bridge the communication gap. Slightly older children who have developmental delays may benefit, too. Teaching and practicing baby sign language also can be fun and give you and your child an opportunity to bond. 

To begin teaching your child baby sign language, familiarize yourself with signs through books, websites, community classes or other sources. You can also use variations of American Sign Language. Start with signs to describe routine requests, activities and objects in your child's life — such as more, drink, eat, mother and father. 

To get the most out of your baby sign language experience, keep these tips in mind: 

In addition, be sure to continue talking to your child even as you teach baby sign language. Spoken communication remains an important part of your child's speech development.

		Is it safe to hold a baby in a baby sling?
	","
A baby sling — a one-shouldered baby carrier made of soft fabric — can be a safe way to carry a baby, if you follow important safety guidelines. When used incorrectly, however, a baby sling can pose a suffocation hazard to an infant younger than age 4 months. 

Babies have weak neck muscles and can't control their heads during the first few months after birth. If the baby sling's fabric presses against a baby's nose and mouth, he or she may not be able to breathe. This can quickly lead to suffocation. In addition, a baby sling can keep a baby in a curled position — bending the chin to the chest. This position can restrict the baby's airways and limit his or her oxygen supply. In turn, this can prevent a baby from being able to cry for help and also poses a risk of suffocation.

		Is it OK for a baby to wear sunscreen?
	","
Baby sunscreen recommendations differ for infants younger and older than 6 months. Consider these general guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Food and Drug Administration and the American Cancer Society:

When choosing baby sunscreen, pick a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. To avoid irritating your baby's skin and eyes, use a sunscreen that contains only inorganic filters, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Avoid using products that combine sunscreen and the insect repellent DEET, since sunscreen must be regularly reapplied and insect repellent typically doesn't need to be reapplied. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if your baby is spending time in the water or perspiring.

		At what age do children start losing their baby teeth?
	","
A child's baby teeth (primary teeth) begin to loosen and fall out on their own to make room for permanent teeth at about age 6. Timing can vary, though, and girls generally lose baby teeth earlier than do boys. The last baby teeth typically fall out by age 12 or 13. 

Baby teeth usually fall out in the order in which they erupted — first the two bottom front teeth (lower central incisors), followed by the two top front teeth (upper central incisors), the lateral incisors, first molars, canines and second molars. If a child loses a baby tooth early as a result of tooth decay or an accident, a permanent tooth may erupt early and potentially come in crooked due to limited space. 

Some children are excited to lose their baby teeth, while others are nervous about this childhood milestone. If your child wants you to pull out a loose tooth, grasp it firmly with a tissue or piece of gauze and remove it with a quick twist. If the tooth is resistant, wait a few days and try again. If you're concerned about a baby tooth that doesn't seem to loosen sufficiently on its own, check with your child's dentist. He or she may recommend a wait-and-see approach or an extraction in the dental office. 

When your child starts to lose his or her baby teeth, reinforce the importance of proper dental care. For example:

Baby walkers — devices designed to give babies mobility while they're learning to walk — can cause serious injuries. 

For example, babies who use baby walkers may: 

Even new baby walkers — which typically use brakes to prevent falls and are too large to fit through doorways — can still lead to serious injury. In addition, research shows that use of baby walkers can actually delay when a baby begins to sit, crawl or walk unassisted, as well as slow a baby's mental and motor development. 

Don't allow your baby to use a baby walker and make sure that your baby's other caregivers don't use baby walkers, either. Instead, consider using a stationary activity center, play yard, playpen or high chair. These devices will allow your baby to play safely as he or she learns to sit, crawl and stand.

		Is there any way to influence a baby's sex?
	","
The short answer is no — there's not much the average couple can do to affect a baby's sex.

In one study, women who ate breakfast cereal daily around the time of conception were more likely to conceive boys — but some scientists question the study's method of analysis. In addition, countless old wives' tales suggest that everything from a woman's diet to sexual position during conception can affect a baby's sex, but these theories remain unproved. Likewise, researchers have found that timing sex in relation to ovulation — such as having sex days before ovulation to conceive a boy or closer to ovulation to conceive a girl — doesn't work.

Rarely, couples face the agonizing problem of knowing they could pass a genetic trait to a child of a specific sex — usually a boy. Under those special circumstances couples may use high-tech interventions to influence the chance of conceiving a girl. For example:

Despite the feasibility of these techniques, they're rarely used when choosing a baby's sex for personal reasons is the only motivation.

		Does back labor really happen?
	","
The term ""back labor"" is sometimes used to describe labor in which the most discomfort is felt in the lower back, just above the tailbone — and yes, it really happens. Back labor sometimes occurs when the baby enters the birth canal faceup instead of facedown. That isn't always the case, however. Some women simply feel more tension in their backs during labor and delivery than others do.

Although you can't prevent back labor, you can ease back pain during labor. Consider these suggestions: 

Work with your health care team to evaluate your options for pain relief during labor. Whether you experience back labor or feel labor pain elsewhere, being familiar with pain management techniques can give you a greater sense of control.

		For back pain relief, is it better to sit on an ergonomic office chair or a fitness ball?
	","
If long periods seated at a desk are giving you a sore back, your office chair may need adjusting to give you better back support — or you may even need a new chair designed to reduce back pain. Sitting on a fitness ball for office work is not recommended. 

To stay upright on a fitness ball, you have to make constant, small adjustments in muscle tension and weight distribution. This effort helps you achieve the benefits of core-strengthening exercises performed with a fitness ball. Prolonged balancing on a fitness ball, however, may lead to increased fatigue and discomfort in your back.

		What's the difference between a bacterial infection and a viral infection?
	","
As you might think, bacterial infections are caused by bacteria and viral infections are caused by viruses. Infections caused by bacteria include strep throat, tuberculosis and urinary tract infections. Diseases that result from viruses include chickenpox, AIDS and the common cold. 

Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that thrive in many different types of environments. Some varieties live in extremes of cold or heat, while others make their home in people's intestines, where they help digest food. Most bacteria cause no harm to people. 

Viruses are even smaller than bacteria and require living hosts — such as people, plants or animals — to multiply. Otherwise, they can't survive. When a virus enters your body, it invades some of your cells and takes over the cell machinery, redirecting it to produce the virus. 

Perhaps the most important distinction between bacteria and viruses is that antibiotic drugs usually kill bacteria, but they aren't effective against viruses. In some cases, it may be difficult to determine whether a bacterium or a virus is causing your symptoms. Many ailments — such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhea — can be caused by either type of microbe. 

Inappropriate use of antibiotics has helped create strains of bacterial disease that are resistant to treatment with different types of antibiotic medications.

		I've always struggled with bad breath. Could a tongue scraper help?
	","
Tongue scrapers, which are available in most drugstores in various shapes and sizes, have been touted as a way to reduce or eliminate bad breath (halitosis). You put the tongue scraper at the back of your tongue and bring it forward along your tongue, repeating as often as needed. 

Research on the effectiveness of tongue scrapers is limited. What's been published so far describes tongue scraping as temporarily effective for bad breath, but there's not enough evidence that using a tongue scraper helps with ongoing (chronic) halitosis. 

However, if you have a coated tongue, which can occur from an overgrowth of bacteria, tongue scraping may be helpful. For instance, a coated tongue can be caused by smoking, dry mouth, poor oral hygiene or medication use. 

Although there's no harm in trying a tongue scraper to treat bad breath, it's just as important to practice good dental hygiene overall: 

If bad breath continues, consult your dentist. He or she can identify the cause and help develop a treatment plan.

		What are barefoot running shoes? Are they better than traditional running shoes?
	","
The latest trend among runners, barefoot running shoes look more like gloves than shoes. Indeed, they're often called five toe shoes. Inspired by a growing enthusiasm for barefoot running, barefoot running shoes are lower to the ground, lighter and less cushioned than conventional running shoes. They're designed to provide some protection for your feet while offering some of the desirable aspects of barefoot running. 

Traditional running shoes emphasize stability and cushioning, with thick soles and elevated heels. But there's no evidence that these shoes prevent injuries, and in some individuals they may actually increase injury risk. Although barefoot running does carry risks, shoeless runners may avoid some of the potentially harmful forces that conventional running shoe wearers experience. 

If you're happy with your current running shoes, there's no need to change. If you want to experiment with barefoot running shoes, ease into it. Make sure to find a shoe that's appropriate for your foot, and choose softer and more forgiving running surfaces at first, such as a cushioned track. Also talk to a sports medicine specialist or foot doctor if you've had injuries or foot problems in the past.

		What causes barrel chest?
	","
The term ""barrel chest"" describes a rounded, bulging chest that resembles the shape of a barrel. Barrel chest isn't a disease, but it may indicate an underlying condition. 

For example, people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — such as emphysema — often develop a slight barrel chest in the later stages of the disease. It occurs because the lungs are chronically overinflated with air, so the rib cage stays partially expanded all the time. This makes breathing less efficient and aggravates any existing shortness of breath. 

Barrel chest also can be related to osteoarthritis affecting the joints where the ribs attach to the spine. These joints tend to stiffen and become fixed in their most expanded position — causing the appearance of a barrel chest. 

Generally, barrel chest isn't treated.

But larger clinical trials are needed to support these initial findings.Bellamine isn't usually recommended as a first-line drug to treat hot flashes because of its potential side effects, which can include sedation. For this reason, other medications — such as estrogens, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin or clonidine — are often tried first before Bellamine."
"I still have some residual effects from Bell's palsy. I need dental work on a broken tooth, but it's on the side of my face affected by Bell's palsy. Will injections to deaden the tooth adversely affect the nerves that have been damaged?","The short answer is no. Bell's palsy affects the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII or CN-VII), which controls facial movement. During dental procedures, a dentist may inject a local anesthetic into a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN-V) — which is a different nerve. The trigeminal nerve controls sensation and pain in the face, mouth, teeth and gums. For this reason, local anesthetic doesn't involve the nerves affected by previous Bell's palsy."

		My friend wants me to sign up for a belly-dancing class with her. Is belly-dancing a good exercise for weight loss?
	","
Belly-dancing and other types of dance can be good exercises for weight loss. In fact, you can burn as many calories belly-dancing as you can walking, swimming or riding a bike. As with any physical activity, however, the weight-loss benefits of belly-dancing depend on several factors — including the frequency and length of your workouts and your exertion level. 

If weight loss is a priority, choose a belly-dancing teacher who keeps you moving continuously throughout the class. You'll get the most benefit from belly-dancing classes that involve traveling steps. Bottom line: The more you move, the more calories you'll burn. 

Of course, an overall fitness program includes more than aerobic activity. Strength training, stretching and core exercises — such as abdominal crunches — also are important.

		I've heard that learning a second language can help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Is this true?
	","
There may be benefits of being bilingual. Several studies have shown that if you know two or more languages — and you've been diagnosed as likely to develop Alzheimer's — you may experience a delay in the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Researchers believe being bilingual or multilingual helps develop your brain's ""cognitive reserve"" in the same way that engaging in other mentally and socially stimulating activities does. 

More research is needed before it's completely understood how cognitive reserve works to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. It's thought that activities that develop cognitive reserve work because they increase the robustness of your brain's architecture — enriching blood flow, enhancing neuronal activity and putting more of your brain to use. This may compensate for the loss of diseased parts of the brain.

Engaging in a variety of activities, especially those promoting mental and social stimulation, may help people at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia slow or delay its onset. And if you're interested in learning another language, go for it. However, more research is needed before it's known whether learning a second language later in life has the same protective effect as might a lifetime of speaking a second language.

Why can't people with asthma take beta blockers?,"Alzheimer's caregiving is a tough, tough job. The physical demands and the emotional strains are exhausting. Before you know it, you've drifted away from your family and friends — at a time when you need them the most.Not only can this be harmful to your physical and mental health, but it also can affect the quality of the care you provide. Caregiver burnout is one of the main reasons people with Alzheimer's are placed in nursing homes."
"
		Can beta blockers cause weight gain?
	","
Yes. Weight gain can occur as a side effect of some beta blockers, especially the older ones, such as atenolol (Tenormin) and metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL). The average weight gain is no more than 4 pounds (about 2 kilograms). Newer beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg), don't typically cause weight gain as a side effect. 

However, the beta blockers that can cause weight gain usually aren't prescribed unless other medications haven't worked, or if you have a specific heart condition that requires taking those medications. 

Beta blockers are used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure and migraines. Doctors aren't sure exactly why some beta blockers cause weight gain. It could be that beta blockers slow your metabolism. Also, if you switch from taking a water pill (diuretic) to a beta blocker as a treatment for high blood pressure, you may gain a few pounds of weight that the diuretic kept off. 

If you're taking a beta blocker for heart failure, tell your doctor immediately if you begin to gain more than 3 to 4 pounds (about 1.5 to 2 kilograms), particularly if the weight gain continues beyond your first week of taking the drug. This could mean that fluid is building up in your legs, abdomen or chest, which may signal that your heart failure is worsening. 
"
"
		My doctor recently prescribed a beta blocker to lower my blood pressure. Now, when I exercise, I have trouble getting my heart rate higher than 135. Is this normal?
	","
Beta blockers slow your heart rate, which can prevent the increase in heart rate that typically occurs with exercise. This means that it might not be possible for you to reach your target heart rate — the number of heartbeats per minute you should have to ensure you're exercising at the proper intensity level. No matter how hard you exercise when taking a beta blocker, you may never reach your target heart rate. However, being unable to reach your previous target heart rate doesn't mean you're not getting cardiovascular benefits from exercise. 

There's no precise way to predict the effect of beta blockers on your heart rate. An exercise stress test, which checks blood flow through your heart while you exercise, can measure how hard your heart pumps while you're taking beta blockers. Your doctor can use this information to adjust the target heart rate you should work to. 

You can also try lowering your target heart rate by the amount that your resting heart rate has been lowered by the beta blocker. For example, if your resting heart rate has decreased from 70 to 50, then try working at a target heart rate 20 beats per minute lower than what you used to do. This way of calculating your adjusted target heart rate isn't precise, and sometimes the peak exercise heart rate is affected much more than is the resting heart rate. An exercise stress test is the best way to establish a new target heart rate on beta blockers. 

If you haven't had an exercise stress test, you can use a perceived exertion scale, such as the Borg scale, which relies on your own judgment of how hard you're working based on effort, breathlessness and fatigue. Ask your doctor for help finding and using an exertion scale. For most workouts, your best bet is to aim for moderate intensity.

	","
A bezoar (BE-zor) is a solid mass of indigestible material that accumulates in your digestive tract, sometimes causing a blockage. Bezoars usually form in the stomach, sometimes in the small intestine or, rarely, the large intestine. They can occur in children and adults. 

Bezoars occur most often in people with certain risk factors, including if you: 

One type of bezoar (trichobezoar) may occur in people with psychiatric illness or developmental disabilities. 

Bezoars are classified according to the material that forms them: 

Bezoars can cause lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, weight loss and a feeling of fullness after eating only a little food. Bezoars can also cause gastric ulcers, intestinal bleeding and obstruction, leading to tissue death (gangrene) in a portion of the digestive tract. 

Small bezoars may pass through the digestive tract on their own or after you take medication to help dissolve the mass. Severe cases, especially large trichobezoars, often require surgery. 

If you don't have one of the risk factors for bezoars, you're not likely to develop them. If you are at risk, reducing your intake of foods with high amounts of indigestible cellulose may reduce your risk.

No, they aren't. The term ""bioidentical"" means the hormones in the product are chemically identical to those your body produces. In fact, they are — but so are the hormones used in many FDA-approved hormone replacement products.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several medical specialty groups, bioidentical hormones may be riskier than are hormones used in standard hormone therapy, and there's no evidence they're any more effective.

		Is bipolar disorder in children possible? Most of what I've read says bipolar disorder develops in adults.
	","
Bipolar disorder in children is possible. It's most often diagnosed in older children and adolescents, but bipolar disorder can occur in children of any age. As in adults, bipolar disorder in children can cause mood swings from the highs of hyperactivity or euphoria (mania) to the lows of serious depression. 

Emotional upheaval and unruly behaviors are a normal part of childhood and adolescence, and in most cases they aren't a sign of a mental health problem that needs treatment. All kids have rough periods — it's normal to feel down, angry, hyperactive or rebellious at times. However, if your child's symptoms are severe, ongoing or causing significant problems, it may be more than just a phase.

Here are some common signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder in children:

Keep in mind, a number of other childhood disorders cause bipolar-like symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, anxiety and major depression. To make diagnosis even more complicated, these and other mental health conditions often occur along with bipolar disorder. It may take years to pinpoint the cause or causes of your child's extreme moods or behaviors.

If your child has serious mood swings, depression or behavior problems, consult a mental health provider who specializes in children. Mood and behavior issues caused by bipolar disorder or other mental health conditions can lead to major problems. Early treatment can help prevent serious consequences and decrease the impact of mental health problems on your child as he or she gets older.

What role do antidepressants play in bipolar disorder treatment? Is it true they can worsen symptoms?,"The role of antidepressants in bipolar disorder treatment remains somewhat controversial.There is some concern that treating a person with bipolar disorder who is in a depressed phase with an antidepressant alone may transform that depression into mania with potential adverse consequences, such as a suicidal behavior. In addition, certain antidepressants may carry a greater risk of this than do others.For these reasons, some psychiatrists have been very cautious in the use of antidepressants in people with bipolar disorder. Instead, they have opted to use antidepressants in combination with mood stabilizers or to not use antidepressants and to use mood stabilizers alone or in combination with neuroleptic drugs approved for bipolar disorder treatment.Trying to determine who may react negatively to antidepressants is difficult and generally depends on the individual. Risk factors that may increase the risk of a negative reaction include genetic changes in the serotonin transporter gene, concurrent substance abuse, prior treatment failure with antidepressants, and so-called ""rapid cycling"" forms of the illness. However, some psychiatrists believe that more conclusive research is needed before conclusions can be reached about risks of antidepressants in people with bipolar disorder.If you suffer from depression and have bipolar disorder, it is important to work with a psychiatrist who has experience in dealing with mood disorders and can carefully assess and develop a treatment plan that meets your specific needs. If a specific medication is recommended, discuss with your doctor the potential benefits and risks of this medication."

		Do all bipolar medications cause weight gain?
	","
Bipolar disorder can be treated with a number of medications. Some of these medications can increase your appetite or cause changes in metabolism leading to weight gain.

Whether a certain medication will cause weight gain or other side effects varies from person to person. Likewise, how well the medication works to treat bipolar disorder symptoms differs for each individual. Because of this, finding the medications that best treat your symptoms may require some trial and error. In some cases, medications that increase the risk of weight gain may be needed only temporarily to get your symptoms under control. Then, you and your doctor can find long-term (maintenance) treatment that keeps symptoms at bay and causes the least amount of side effects. 

Medications for bipolar disorders include mood stabilizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 

Some weight gain may be inevitable when taking medications needed to control your bipolar symptoms. If weight gain is an issue, ask your doctor for advice on strategies to manage it. Learning tips for healthy eating, keeping physically active and getting psychological counseling (psychotherapy) can all help.

		Do birth control pills cause birth defects if taken during early pregnancy?
	","
Taking birth control pills during early pregnancy isn't thought to increase the risk of birth defects.

A 2009 study suggested an association between the use of birth control pills during the time of conception and an increased risk of low birth weight or preterm delivery. Also, older research suggested that use of certain birth control pills during pregnancy could pose a risk of developmental problems with a female baby's sexual organs — such as enlargement of the clitoris. Generally, however, these concerns haven't been observed in clinical experience.

It might be difficult to recognize the signs and symptoms of pregnancy if you become pregnant while taking the minipill (progestin-only birth control pill) because nausea, breast tenderness and irregular menstrual bleeding — common signs and symptoms of pregnancy — are also possible side effects of the minipill. In addition, if you do conceive while taking the minipill there's a slightly higher chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic — when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube.

As a precaution, stop taking birth control pills if you suspect you're pregnant. Until the pregnancy is confirmed or ruled out, use another method of birth control — such as condoms. If you're concerned because you took birth control pills before you knew you were pregnant, be assured that there's little risk. It's always important to discuss any medication use during pregnancy with your health care provider, however.

You can take birth control pills as long as you need birth control or until you reach menopause, as long as you're generally healthy and don't smoke. This applies to all types of birth control pills, including combination birth control pills and progestin-only birth control pills. 

Birth control pills aren't recommended for certain women, however, including women age 35 or older who smoke and women who have certain medical conditions, such as blood-clotting disorders or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Some types of birth control pills aren't recommended for women who are breast-feeding. 

Years ago it was thought that prolonged use of birth control pills would interfere with a woman's subsequent ability to conceive, but this has been shown to be false. Similarly, doctors used to recommend taking an occasional break from birth control pills, but this offers no benefits and may increase your risk of an unplanned pregnancy.

Some research suggests that prolonged use of birth control pills increases the risk of certain types of cancer, such as cervical cancer and liver cancer. However, use of birth control pills also decreases the risk of other types of cancer, such as ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer.

The effect of birth control pills on breast cancer risk isn't clear. Some research indicates that birth control pills slightly increase the risk of breast cancer — but that 10 or more years after stopping the pill, a woman's breast cancer risk returns to the same level as if she had never taken birth control pills. Other studies don't support a link between birth control pills and breast cancer. 

If you're concerned about long-term use of birth control pills, discuss the risks and benefits with your health care provider. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of other types of contraception as well.

		Is bitter orange safe and effective for weight loss?
	","
While some research studies suggest that bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) can help with modest weight loss when combined with diet and exercise, it's probably not worth the risk. That's because bitter orange can cause a range of potentially serious health problems. So if you're trying to lose weight, stick to healthier methods and skip the bitter orange.

Bitter orange is an herb made from the bitter orange tree. Extracts from bitter orange peel are often found in weight-loss supplements and supplements sold for a variety of health concerns. Bitter orange gained popularity among dieters and weight-loss supplement manufacturers looking for alternatives after the Food and Drug Administration banned the herbal supplement ephedra (ma-huang) because of the health problems it caused.

But bitter orange poses some of the same serious health risks because of its stimulant-like effects. Among the many chemicals in bitter orange are synephrine and octopamine — chemicals similar to those in ephedra. These chemicals may speed up your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. Stroke and heart attack have been reported in some people using bitter orange alone or in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine.

Remember, just because an herbal supplement may be natural doesn't mean it's safe. Always check with your doctor before taking any herbal supplements.

With a blighted ovum, a woman may miss a period and have a positive pregnancy test. This is because the placenta secretes human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a pregnancy hormone. Symptoms of early pregnancy — such as fatigue and breast tenderness — are possible as well. But when the placenta stops growing and hormone levels decrease, the pregnancy symptoms subside. At this point, minor abdominal cramping and light spotting or bleeding are possible. An ultrasound will show an empty gestational sac. 

A blighted ovum eventually results in miscarriage. Some women choose to wait for the miscarriage to happen naturally, while others take medication to trigger the miscarriage. In some cases, a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) is used to remove the placental tissues. 

Most women who've had a blighted ovum go on to have successful pregnancies. If you experience multiple consecutive miscarriages, you might consider testing to identify any underlying causes.

What causes a blocked tear duct? How do you treat it?,"Blocked tear ducts occur most often in older adults — although they can occur in younger people as well. Causes of a blocked tear duct include:Normally when you blink, your eyelids spread tears over the surface of your eye and push excess tears into your tear ducts, where they drain into your nose. If your tear ducts are blocked, the tears have no place to go — and they back up and spill over the lower eyelid.Blockage of the tear ducts can occur anywhere in the tear-drainage system. Occasionally, a blocked nasolacrimal duct can lead to an infection in the lacrimal sac due to bacteria that accumulate in the stagnated tears (dacryocystitis). This may cause swelling and tenderness in the area between the inner angle of your eye and the bridge of your nose.Treatment of blocked tear ducts may include:"

		Is it normal to pass large blood clots during menstruation?
	","
It can be normal to pass blood clots during menstruation. The amount, length and frequency of menstrual bleeding vary with the individual. However, if your periods are heavier than usual — especially if you're soaking through one pad or tampon every hour for several hours or you're passing blood clots larger than your fist — consult your doctor. He or she will determine whether there's an underlying problem causing your heavy periods. Your doctor may also recommend a blood test to check for iron deficiency anemia.

	","
""Blood poisoning"" is not a medical term. But as the term is usually used, it refers to the presence of bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) — and not a poisonous substance in the blood. However, bacteremia is a serious illness and requires prompt medical attention. 

<strong>When to see a doctor</strong> <br/>
If you recently had a medical or dental procedure or injection and have any of the following signs and symptoms, see your doctor right away: 

A diagnosis of bacteremia is usually confirmed by a blood culture. Treatment requires hospitalization and includes intravenous antibiotics. Without prompt treatment, bacteremia can quickly progress to severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.

		Does cuff size affect blood pressure readings?
	","
Using a blood pressure cuff that's too large or too small can give you inaccurate blood pressure readings. Your doctor's office should have several sizes of cuffs to ensure an accurate blood pressure reading. 

Also, when you measure your blood pressure at home, it's important to use the proper size cuff. The inflatable part of the blood pressure cuff should cover about 80 percent of the circumference of your upper arm. The cuff should cover two-thirds of the distance from your elbow to your shoulder. 

If you're concerned about the size of your cuff or your blood pressure readings, talk to your doctor. He or she may check your blood pressure several times with the same, appropriately sized, cuff in the same arm. Averaging multiple readings taken during the same visit should give your ""true"" blood pressure at that point in time.

Don't make changes to your blood pressure medication on your own, however. Do so only after getting your doctor's OK.

		Can some blood pressure medications cause an increase in triglycerides?
	","
Yes, some blood pressure medications can affect triglyceride and cholesterol levels. However, the blood pressure medications that can increase your triglycerides usually aren't prescribed unless other medications haven't worked or you have a specific heart condition that requires taking those medications. 

High doses — 50 milligrams or more — of some diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, can temporarily increase your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol and triglycerides. However, this spike usually returns to normal within a year of starting these medications. 

Older beta blockers, such as propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), atenolol (Tenormin) and metoprolol (Lopressor), can slightly increase triglycerides and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or ""good"") cholesterol. Typically this occurs in people who have a cluster of conditions (metabolic syndrome) that includes: 

Newer beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg) and nebivolol (Bystolic), are less likely to affect your cholesterol levels. 

The older beta blocker drugs that can affect your cholesterol levels usually shouldn't be one of the first drugs you're given as a treatment for high blood pressure. Older beta blocker drugs are useful, however, in specific instances such as to prevent recurrent coronary artery disease, to manage heart failure and to treat people at risk of cardiovascular disease. 

If you're worried about increasing triglyceride levels, talk to your doctor about making changes to your diet and exercise routine. Also, before making any changes in your drug therapy, talk to your doctor.

"
		My blood pressure measurements at home are always higher than at my doctor's office. Am I doing something wrong?
	","
Blood pressure measurements that are higher at your home than at your doctor's office could be caused by a decrease in stress at your doctor's office, or an error in measuring your blood pressure at home. 

The opposite, higher blood pressure at your doctor's office than at your home, is often called white-coat hypertension. This means that the stress or anxiety of being in your doctor's office causes your blood pressure to be higher than it normally is at home, where you feel at ease. 

Having lower blood pressure measurements at the doctor's office than at home is called masked hypertension. Masked hypertension can occur if a calm, quiet environment at your doctor's office is less stressful than the environment at home — leading to a lower blood pressure reading at the doctor's office. Likewise, use of alcohol, caffeine or cigarettes at home can increase blood pressure. 

Be sure that your home blood pressure monitor is accurate and that you're using correct technique. If you're not sure, ask your doctor. He or she may ask you to bring the home blood pressure monitor to the office. You may measure your blood pressure in one arm with the home monitor while your doctor measures your blood pressure in the other arm with the office equipment. 

Still, some people consistently get different blood pressure readings outside the doctor's office — even when blood pressure is measured correctly and repeatedly. If your home blood pressure readings are accurate and consistently higher than those at your doctor's office, your doctor will likely manage your blood pressure based on the higher readings.

		When I measure my blood pressure at home, I've noticed that the reading is always higher in one arm. Should I be concerned?
	","
Generally, a small difference in blood pressure readings between arms isn't a health concern. However, a difference of more than 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for systolic pressure (top number) or more than 10 mm Hg for diastolic pressure (bottom number) may be a sign of an underlying problem — such as narrowing of the main arteries to that arm. If you have a significant difference in blood pressure readings between arms, talk to your doctor. 

A difference of 10 to 15 mm Hg for systolic pressure that shows up repeatedly is a risk marker for vascular disease and for a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease and related complications during the next 10 years. 

Your doctor may measure your blood pressure in both arms to see if you have high blood pressure (hypertension). If your blood pressure is higher in one arm, your doctor will probably use the blood pressure reading from that arm to monitor your blood pressure. 

A large difference in blood pressure measurement between your arms could signal a health problem, such as:

		Does blood pressure have a daily pattern? I've noticed that my blood pressure is always lower in the morning than at night.
	","
Blood pressure has a daily pattern. Blood pressure is normally lower at night while you're sleeping. Your blood pressure starts to rise a few hours before you wake up. Your blood pressure continues to rise during the day, usually peaking in the middle of the afternoon. Then in the late afternoon and evening, your blood pressure begins dropping again. 

Having an abnormal blood pressure pattern, such as high blood pressure in the morning, can mean that you have a health problem. Potential problems include: 

Risk factors for developing an abnormal blood pressure pattern include: 

Your doctor can tell you if an abnormal daily blood pressure pattern may need treatment. He or she may recommend a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring test. The device used for this test measures your blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period and provides a more accurate picture of blood pressure changes over a typical day and night. 
"
"
		Can cold weather or seasonal changes in weather affect blood pressure?
	","
Blood pressure generally is higher in the winter and lower in the summer. That's because low temperatures cause your blood vessels to narrow — which increases blood pressure because more pressure is needed to force blood through your narrowed veins and arteries. 

In addition to cold weather, blood pressure may also be affected by a sudden change in weather patterns, such as a weather front or a storm. Your body — and blood vessels — may react to abrupt changes in humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloud cover or wind in much the same way it reacts to cold. These weather-related variations in blood pressure are more common in people age 65 and older. 

Other seasonal causes of higher blood pressure include weight gain and decreased physical activity in winter. If you have high blood pressure already, continue to monitor your blood pressure readings as the seasons change and talk to your doctor. Your doctor may recommend changing the dose of your blood pressure medication or switching to another medication. Don't make any changes to your medications without talking to your doctor. 

If you have questions about how weather may affect your blood pressure, ask your doctor.

		My 15-year-old son has diabetes. When his blood sugar is low, he seems depressed. When his blood sugar is high, he's often agitated and short-tempered. Is there any connection between blood sugar level and mood?
	","
Fluctuations in blood sugar levels can be associated with changes in mood. However, this typically occurs only with extremely high or low blood sugar levels. 

It's important to remember that many factors can contribute to mood changes in people who have diabetes. It can take time to adjust emotionally to a diabetes diagnosis, as well as the need to manage the disease. This adjustment can be especially challenging during adolescence. 

Encourage your son to check and record his blood sugar level consistently — and specifically when you notice a mood change. If your son's mood swings occur often or become a persistent problem, consult his doctor. The information in your son's blood sugar log may help the doctor make adjustments to your son's diabetes treatment plan, if needed. If factors other than blood sugar level seem to be at play, the doctor may recommend consulting a mental health professional.

"
		If you're taking a blood thinner, is it still possible for you to get a blood clot?
	","
Yes. Medications that are commonly called blood thinners — such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and heparin — significantly decrease your risk of blood clotting, but will not decrease the risk to zero. These medications must be taken exactly as directed to work safely and effectively. Taking too little of these medications may not be effective, and taking too much can lead to serious bleeding. 

Also, blood thinners may not be able to lessen the strong blood-clotting tendency of an underlying disease, such as cancer. 

Interactions with other medications, food and alcohol are common with blood-thinning medications, especially warfarin. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of your blood thinner, making you more likely to develop blood clots. If you take a blood thinner, be sure to follow your doctor's advice on dosing and ask about foods and other medications — including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements — that may interfere with the blood thinner.

Is a higher BMI OK for weightlifters? I do cardio five days a week and lift weights three days a week. I'm 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh 180 pounds.,"Body mass index (BMI) uses your height and weight to calculate your percentage of body fat. For most people, BMI provides a reliable estimate of weight-related health risks. But it does have limitations. Because BMI doesn't differentiate between lean muscle and fat, it may overestimate body fat in people who have muscular builds, such as weightlifters. As a result, your BMI can be high but your disease risk still can be low.At 5 feet 9 inches tall and 180 pounds, your BMI is 26.6. A BMI greater than 24.9 generally means you are considered overweight. (If you are Asian, overweight is defined as a BMI greater than 22.9.) However, if a significant portion of your weight is lean muscle and you exercise regularly, your health risks are likely to be the same as if your BMI was less than 25.In addition to BMI, doctors have several other methods for determining whether you are overweight or obese. These include:"

		How accurate are portable body fat analyzers?
	","
Although the technology is improving, it's difficult to get an accurate body fat measurement from most commercially available body fat analyzers. 

Various types of body fat analyzers — also called impedance meters — are available to the general public. Results from portable body fat analyzers can vary depending on many factors, however, including the quality of the device and how hydrated you are when the measurement is taken. 

If you're concerned about your body fat percentage, skip the commercially available body fat analyzers and ask your doctor about more accurate measurement techniques. 

Depending on the circumstances, options may include: 

Body fat can also be estimated using cross-sectional imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan. These scans can provide the most precise body composition measurements, especially for intra-abdominal fat measurement. They are expensive, however, and not indicated for everyone. 

Depending on the information desired, you and your doctor can determine the optimal type of body fat measurement. Keep in mind that specific body fat measurement techniques can be expensive and may not be available in all locations.

"
		When you lose weight, where does the lost body fat go?
	","
To understand the answer, it helps to remember that fat is basically stored energy. Your body converts fat to usable energy for your muscles and other tissues through a series of complex metabolic processes. This causes your fat cells to shrink. 

These metabolic activities also generate heat, which helps maintain your body temperature, and waste products. These waste products — water and carbon dioxide — are excreted in your urine and sweat or exhaled from your lungs.

I know that obesity is a risk factor for diabetes. But I've been told that body shape also plays a role. Is this true?,"Yes, it's true. People who carry most of their excess weight around their waist (often called ""apples"") are at greater risk of diabetes than are those who carry most of their excess weight below their waist (often called ""pears"").The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body's cells become to the effects of your own insulin. But this appears especially true if your weight is concentrated around your abdomen.To determine whether you're carrying too much weight around your abdomen, measure the circumference of your waist at its smallest point, usually at the level of your navel. Using a flexible, cloth-like tape measure is best. A measurement of more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women indicates increased health risks.The good news is that you can lower your risk of diabetes by achieving and maintaining a healthy weight."

		Can Botox injections relieve arthritis pain?
	","
In early studies, Botox injections appear to reduce arthritis pain in the shoulder, knee and hip. These results are promising, but they fall short of proving that Botox injections are an effective treatment for arthritis pain. 

Botox is the brand name for onabotulinumtoxinA — the pharmaceutical form of botulinum toxin type A. This toxin is produced by the bacterium that causes the food poisoning botulism. When injected in small doses into specific muscles, Botox blocks the chemical signals that cause muscles to contract.

So far, participants in various studies have reported improvement in arthritis pain and function after Botox injections. There's much left to learn about the possible role of Botox injections in arthritis treatment, however. While research continues, proven treatment options — such as exercise, weight loss and medication — remain the focus of most arthritis treatment plans.

My wife and I are trying to get pregnant. Are there any natural methods for predetermining the sex of our baby?,"Folklore is full of creative, do-it-yourself suggestions for predetermining your baby's sex. For example, women should eat more meat and salty foods to get a boy, or couples should make love with the man on top during a full moon to get a girl. Most of these methods are harmless, if you want to try them just for fun. But there's no scientific evidence that any of these methods are effective.One popular natural method for gender selection is called the Shettles method. It is based on the premise that intercourse timing can influence the sex of your baby. For instance, couples are supposedly more likely to have a boy if they have intercourse as close to ovulation as possible — when conditions in the vagina are apparently more favorable for the ""Y"" (male) sperm. Proponents of the Shettles method claim it is up to 75 percent effective. But many experts dispute this.There are effective medical techniques for selecting the sex of your child using in vitro fertilization. However, these techniques are usually reserved for the prevention of sex-specific genetic disorders, such as hemophilia and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which primarily affect males. Many doctors' groups are opposed to the use of gender selection for nonmedical reasons."

I have read that the timing of breast cancer surgery in relation to a woman's menstrual cycle has an effect on long-term survival. Is this true?,"There is no clear evidence that the optimal timing of breast cancer surgery is related to the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women.Several studies have evaluated whether breast cancer surgery done during a particular phase of the menstrual cycle had an impact on long-term survival. One study published in 1998 suggested that the timing of surgery relative to the menstrual cycle did affect the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, many subsequent studies have failed to confirm such a relationship between the timing of surgery and menstrual cycle. Several studies are currently ongoing to further clarify this issue."
When is it reasonable for a woman being treated for breast cancer to skip chemotherapy?,"Breast cancer treatment often includes surgery followed by chemotherapy. But in some cases, chemotherapy may not be necessary. You and your doctor must decide which breast cancer treatment is right for you.The decision to take chemotherapy after surgical removal of breast cancer is complex and highly individualized. Chemotherapy benefits many women — and men — with breast cancer. The key question is just how much benefit can it provide? This must be balanced against its side effects, which include hair loss, nausea and fatigue.For those with evidence of a very high risk of cancer recurrence, the potential benefits of chemotherapy are substantial. For those at low risk of recurrence, chemotherapy is much less likely to offer benefits — while still causing the same side effects.In addition, a person's general health must be factored into the decision. Those who are elderly or frail often experience more serious side effects from chemotherapy with little or no benefit. Many alternative treatments are also available, such as hormonal therapies.For these reasons, it is critical to have your doctor explain in detail the benefits and side effects of chemotherapy in order to determine if chemotherapy is the right choice."

		Does caffeine cause breast cysts?
	","
No, caffeine doesn't appear to cause breast cysts (fibrocystic breast changes), a noncancerous (benign) breast disease. In large quantities, though, caffeine can raise the levels of cortisol and other stress hormones in your system — and stress hormones may, over time, affect your reproductive hormones. The interplay of caffeine, stress hormones and reproductive hormones could play a role in premenstrual breast swelling and discomfort. 

Anecdotally, some women report reduced breast pain when they go off caffeine. Although no research has documented this effect, there's no reason not to go caffeine-free to see if it relieves discomfort from breast cysts. 

Also, if you drink several cups of coffee on a typical day, you might consider cutting back. Data from two large, long-term women's health studies suggest a connection between high caffeine intake and precancerous or high-risk breast lesions.

		Is there any connection between breast implants and cancer? And if so, how serious is the risk?
	","
A 2011 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review found a possible association between breast implants and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) — a rare cancer of the immune system. However, the connection between breast implants and cancer isn't well-defined or clearly supported. 

ALCL can develop in various parts of the body, including the lymph nodes and skin. Rarely, it can develop in the breast. According to the National Cancer Institute, ALCL is diagnosed in about 1 out of 500,000 women a year in the United States — and ALCL in the breast is diagnosed in only 3 in 100 million women a year in the United States. 

The FDA reports about 60 cases of ALCL among the millions of women worldwide who have breast implants. The 2011 review identified 34 cases, and a small number of additional cases were reported to the FDA by various outside groups. 

Researchers haven't yet determined whether the surface texture of an implant could affect the risk of ALCL in the breast, or whether the association is higher depending on the type of implant — saline or silicone. 

Any association between breast implants and cancer is concerning. Still, it's important to keep the potential risk in perspective. The number of women in the general population who have ALCL is exceedingly low, and the number is even lower among women who have breast implants. 

If you have breast implants, the new findings aren't a call to change your treatment plan or to have your breast implants removed. Remember, the possibility of ALCL is remote. While research continues, visit your doctor for routine medical care, and report any signs or symptoms — such as swelling, lumps or pain — promptly.

What is a breast lift? How is it different from breast augmentation?,"A breast lift (mastopexy) is a surgical procedure to raise and reshape sagging breasts. Unlike breast augmentation, it does not change the size or firmness of your breasts.During a breast lift procedure, your surgeon moves your nipple and areola to a higher position and removes excess skin from beneath your breast. Closing the remaining skin tightens and lifts the breast. In breast augmentation, your surgeon places an implant behind your breast tissue or a layer of chest wall muscle.Breast lift procedures achieve the best results in women with small breasts, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Breasts of any size can be lifted, but the results may not last as long in heavy breasts.Breast lift and breast augmentation procedures are generally safe when performed by a qualified plastic surgeon. In evaluating whether you might need a breast lift or breast augmentation, your doctor will consider:Sometimes a breast lift is done at the same time as the breast augmentation."

But a persistent breast rash also shouldn't be ignored.A common cause of breast rash is mastitis, an infection of the breast tissue typically associated with breast-feeding. Treatment of mastitis is usually a 10- to 14-day course of antibiotics. However, if the rash doesn't start to clear up after a week on antibiotics, consult your doctor for further evaluation and possible a biopsy.Another common cause of breast rash is dermatitis, an inflammation of the skin due to contact with an irritant or allergen. Treatment of dermatitis is usually with hydrocortisone cream. However, even if your doctor suspects breast dermatitis, it's probably a good idea to have the affected skin evaluated by a dermatologist.Rarely, a breast rash can be a symptom of inflammatory breast cancer. However, skin changes typically associated with inflammatory breast cancer are redness and rapid swelling of a larger area of the breast. The affected skin may also have a dimpled texture, similar to an orange peel. These symptoms require prompt medical evaluation and possibly a biopsy to rule out cancer.You don't indicate whether the rash involves the nipple. But a scaly, itchy rash that affects one nipple and persists despite treatment with skin creams or antibiotics may be a symptom of Paget's disease of the breast, another form of breast cancer.

What is Mayo Clinic's opinion on breast thermography for the early detection of breast cancer?,"Thermography, also called thermal imaging, has been studied for several decades. However, there is no evidence that breast thermography is an effective screening tool for early detection of breast cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.Breast thermography is a way of detecting differences in skin temperature on the surface of the breast with the use of a special heat-sensing (infrared) camera. It is based on the theory that surface temperature increases in areas of increased blood flow and metabolism, such as in a tumor. Breast thermography is noninvasive and uses no radiation.This technology is most effective in detecting tumors that are close to the skin surface but not tumors deeper in the breast. Also, breast thermography is not sensitive enough to detect small cancers.Breast thermography is not routinely used for breast cancer detection and should not be used instead of mammograms.

Breast-feeding and alcohol don't mix well. There's no level of alcohol in breast milk that's considered safe for a baby to drink. 

When you drink alcohol, it passes into your breast milk at concentrations similar to those found in your bloodstream. Although a breast-fed baby is exposed to just a fraction of the alcohol his or her mother drinks, a newborn eliminates alcohol from his or her body at only half the rate of an adult. 

Research suggests that breast-fed babies who are exposed to one drink a day may have impaired motor development and that alcohol can cause changes in sleep patterns. 

In addition, while folklore says that drinking alcohol improves milk production, studies show that alcohol actually decreases milk production and that the presence of alcohol in breast milk causes babies to drink about 20 percent less. 

If you choose to drink, avoid breast-feeding until alcohol has completely cleared your breast milk. This typically takes two to three hours for 12 ounces (340 grams) of 5 percent beer, 5 ounces (142 grams) of 11 percent wine or 1.5 ounces (43 grams) of 40 percent liquor, depending on your body weight. 

Pumping and dumping breast milk isn't necessary and doesn't speed the elimination of alcohol from your body. 

Remember, breast-feeding is the optimal way to feed a newborn and is recommended until a baby is age 1. If you choose to drink, plan carefully to avoid exposing your baby to alcohol.

		Why would a baby go on a breast-feeding strike?
	","
Many factors can trigger a breast-feeding strike — when a baby refuses to breast-feed for a period of time after breast-feeding well for months. Typically, the baby is trying to tell you that something isn't quite right. 

<strong>What happens during a breast-feeding strike</strong> <br/>
During a breast-feeding strike, your baby might appear happy to go to your breast — but then act disinterested or start to cry. Sometimes a breast-feeding strike happens suddenly. In other cases, a strike begins gradually. 

<strong>What causes a breast-feeding strike</strong> <br/>
Common causes of a breast-feeding strike include: 

Keep in mind that if your baby goes on a breast-feeding strike, it doesn't necessarily mean that he or she is ready to wean. Breast-feeding strikes are often short-lived. 

<strong>How to manage a breast-feeding strike</strong> <br/>
A breast-feeding strike can be uncomfortable for you and your baby. You might feel rejected and frustrated. Don't feel guilty, though — it's not your fault. Try to be patient as you manage this change in your baby's eating habits. To prevent engorgement and maintain your milk supply, pump milk on the same schedule your baby used to breast-feed. You can feed the expressed milk to your baby with a spoon, dropper or bottle. 

You might also: 

If a breast-feeding strike lasts more than a few days, your baby has fewer wet diapers than usual or you're concerned about your baby's difficulty breast-feeding, consult your baby's doctor.

		Is it safe to continue breast-feeding if I'm pregnant with another child?
	","
Generally, it's safe to continue breast-feeding while pregnant — as long as you're careful about eating a healthy diet and diligently drinking plenty of fluids. There's an important caveat, however. Breast-feeding can trigger mild uterine contractions. Although these contractions aren't a concern during an uncomplicated pregnancy, your health care provider might discourage breast-feeding while pregnant if you have a history of preterm labor or you're experiencing uterine pain or bleeding.

If you're considering breast-feeding while pregnant, be prepared for changes your nursing child might notice. Although breast milk continues to be nutritionally sound throughout pregnancy, the content of your breast milk will change — which might change the way your milk tastes. In addition, your milk production is quite likely to decrease as your pregnancy progresses. These factors could lead your nursing child to wean on his or her own before the baby is born.

Your comfort might also be a concern. During pregnancy, nipple tenderness and breast soreness are common. The discomfort might intensify while breast-feeding. Pregnancy-related fatigue might pose challenges as well. If you want to continue breast-feeding while pregnant — or breast-feed both the baby and the older child after delivery — you might need additional support from loved ones or other close contacts. Also check with your health care provider about taking supplemental prenatal vitamins.

Your collarbone (clavicle) connects the upper part of your breastbone (sternum) to part of your shoulder blade (scapula). If you think you have a broken collarbone, you should see your doctor right away. Treatment typically includes: 

Most broken collarbones will heal well with this simple treatment, although a small bump may remain in the area of the healed fracture. Surgery may be necessary if the fracture fragments overlap and create shortening of the collarbone, if the fragments are significantly displaced, or if multiple fragments are present. If your broken collarbone requires surgery, your doctor will likely refer you to an orthopedic surgeon.

What can you tell me about a new asthma treatment called bronchial thermoplasty? I read about it on the Internet.,"Bronchial thermoplasty is an experimental treatment for severe asthma. Although preliminary results are promising, more research is needed to determine what role, if any, bronchial thermoplasty should play in asthma treatment.The theory behind bronchial thermoplasty is that asthma is caused by overgrowth of smooth muscle tissue in the large airways (bronchial tubes). During an asthma attack, the muscle contracts and narrows the airways — making breathing more difficult.In bronchial thermoplasty, heat is applied to muscle in the bronchial tubes using a thin, flexible tube (bronchoscope) passed down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs. The heat changes the muscle tissue so that it doesn't contract as tightly. Scientists hope this treatment may decrease asthma symptoms as well as reduce the need for asthma medications in people with severe asthma.Because bronchial thermoplasty is still experimental, it's available only for use in clinical trials at this time."

Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare lung condition in which the small airways (bronchioles), the tiny air-exchange sacs (alveoli) and the walls of small bronchi become inflamed and plugged with connective tissue. BOOP can have many causes. 

In some people, BOOP causes no signs or symptoms. Most people who have BOOP experience a persistent nonproductive cough and — depending on how much of the lung is affected — shortness of breath with exertion. 

Some forms of BOOP have identifiable causes, such as: 

Some think that gastroesophageal reflux disease can be a provoking factor. 

If your doctor is unable to identify a cause, the disorder is called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. 

Most people recover after weeks or months of treatment with a steroid such as prednisone, or treatment of the underlying infection if that's the cause. But in some people, BOOP can progress in spite of treatment.

What does Brugada sign mean? My 16-year-old son has this but has no symptoms. Is this unusual? ,"The term ""Brugada sign"" refers to an abnormality on an electrocardiogram (ECG) — a test that records the electrical activity of your heart — that may indicate Brugada syndrome. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder in which an abnormality in the heart's electrical system causes life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias).It's possible — and even common — to have a Brugada sign without having Brugada syndrome. In these cases, a Brugada sign may result, for instance, from a structural abnormality in your heart, electrolyte abnormalities, or the effects of certain prescription medications or cocaine use.However, if you have a Brugada sign and also have a history of fainting, a history of serious arrhythmias, or a family history of sudden cardiac death, it's likely that you have Brugada syndrome.Brugada syndrome is an inherited condition that occurs most often in men. It also occurs with increased frequency in Asians.Each beat of your heart is triggered by an electrical impulse generated by special cells in the right upper chamber of your heart. Tiny pores, called channels, on each of these cells direct this electrical activity. In Brugada syndrome, a defect in these channels causes episodes of abnormal electrical function.During these episodes, the pumping function of the heart is impaired. This decreases blood flow to the brain, causing fainting. It may also lead to chaotic, uncoordinated electrical activity (ventricular fibrillation), which causes the heart to quiver and stop pumping blood. Sudden death usually follows — unless the heart receives an immediate electrical shock from a device called a defibrillator.Treatment of Brugada syndrome depends on the risk of arrhythmia. Those considered at high risk have:Your doctor may recommend additional testing to further evaluate your risk of dangerous heart rhythms.For high-risk individuals, treatment may include an implantable defibrillator. This small device continuously monitors your heart rhythm and delivers precisely calibrated electrical shocks when needed to control abnormal heartbeats."

		Recently, my daughter got kicked in the head during a soccer game. She seemed fine at the time but later developed a sizable lump on her forehead. Is this a concern?
	","
Probably not. Head trauma resulting from play or sporting events is a common concern for parents, but few bumps on the head of this nature result in serious injury.

The forehead and scalp have an abundant blood supply and injury to these areas often results in bleeding under the skin. When the bleeding is restricted to one area, it causes bruising and swelling. Doctors refer to this as a hematoma.

Keep in mind that even a minor head bump can cause a large swelling. And the mechanism of injury — speed, momentum and size of the people (full-grown adolescents versus children), and the forces involved (such as a concrete floor or other hard surface) — may increase the possibility of serious injury.

<strong>When to see a doctor<br/>
</strong>Occasionally, a blow to the head may be severe enough to cause bleeding in or around the brain. This type of bleeding can cause an intracranial hematoma, a serious condition that puts pressure on the brain.

		Which spread is better for my heart — butter or margarine?
	","
Margarine usually tops butter when it comes to heart health. 

Margarine is made from vegetable oils, so it contains no cholesterol. Margarine is also higher in ""good"" fats — polyunsaturated and monounsaturated — than butter is. These types of fats help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad,"" cholesterol when substituted for saturated fat. 

Butter, on the other hand, is made from animal fat, so it contains cholesterol and high levels of saturated fat. 

But not all margarines are created equal. Some margarines contain trans fat. In general, the more solid the margarine, the more trans fat it contains. So stick margarines usually have more trans fat than tub margarines do. Trans fat, like saturated fat, increases blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. In addition, trans fat lowers high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or ""good,"" cholesterol levels. So skip the stick and opt for soft or liquid margarine instead. 

Look for a spread with the lowest calories that tastes good to you, doesn't have trans fats and has the least amount of saturated fat. When comparing spreads, be sure to read the Nutrition Facts panel and check the grams of saturated fat and trans fat. Also, look for products with a low percent Daily Value for cholesterol. 

If you have high cholesterol, check with your doctor about using spreads that are fortified with plant stanols and sterols, such as Benecol and Promise Activ, which may help reduce cholesterol levels.

Government food-labeling laws determine which cuts of beef can be called ""lean"" or ""extra-lean"" based on fat and cholesterol content. 

When you're selecting beef, choose cuts labeled ""Choice"" or ""Select"" instead of ""Prime"" — which usually has more fat. Opt for cuts with the least amount of visible fat (marbling). Even then, trim any visible fat before preparing the beef. When you're selecting ground beef, opt for the lowest percentage of fat. 

And remember, even when you select the leanest cuts of beef, it's still important to control the total amount of meat in your diet. For adults, the American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 ounces (170 grams) of lean meat a day — including poultry and fish.

		Tell me about the diabetes drugs Byetta, Victoza and Bydureon. Can they really help people who have diabetes lose weight? Are there side effects?
	","
Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon) and liraglutide (Victoza) are taken by injection, similar to insulin, but they're not insulin. These drugs are in a class of drugs called incretin mimetics, which improve blood sugar control by mimicking the action of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Among other things, these drugs allow insulin, which lowers blood sugar, to work more effectively in the body. 

Byetta, Bydureon and Victoza not only improve blood sugar control but may also lead to weight loss. There are many proposed ways in which these medications cause weight loss. They appear to help suppress appetite. But the most prominent effect of these drugs is that they delay the movement of food from the stomach into the small intestine. As a result, you may feel ""full"" faster and longer, so you eat less. 

Byetta is injected twice daily, and Victoza is injected once a day. Bydureon, a newer formulation, is injected once a week. These drugs do have different effects and side effects to consider. 

If you have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia, you shouldn't use exenatide or liraglutide. Laboratory studies have associated these drugs with thyroid tumors in rats. Until more long-term studies are completed, the risk to humans for developing these types of tumors as a result of using these drugs isn't known. 

These drugs are designed for people who have type 2 diabetes and haven't been studied as a weight-loss aid in people who have normal blood sugar. If you have diabetes and wonder if Byetta, Bydureon or Victoza may be helpful, talk to your doctor.

		Should I ask my doctor for a CA 125 blood test to screen for ovarian cancer?

The cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) blood test isn't recommended for women with an average risk of ovarian cancer. 

While women with ovarian cancer often have an elevated level of CA 125, an elevated CA 125 level doesn't always mean you have ovarian cancer. Some women with ovarian cancer never have an elevated CA 125 level. 

Many other conditions also can cause an elevated CA 125 level, including: 

For these reasons, doctors don't recommend CA 125 testing in women with an average risk of ovarian cancer. 

Women with a high risk of ovarian cancer, such as those with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, may consider periodic CA 125 testing. But even in these high-risk situations, there's some disagreement about the usefulness of the CA 125 test. 

A study of 78,216 women ages 55 to 74 randomly selected to receive either an annual CA 125 test and pelvic ultrasound screening or the usual medical care showed that CA 125 test and ultrasound screening did not reduce ovarian cancer deaths. The study also found that false-positive tests resulted in serious complications. 

If you're concerned about your risk of ovarian cancer, ask your doctor about your screening options and ways to reduce your risk.

		What is the cabbage soup diet, and can it help me lose weight?
	","
The cabbage soup diet is generally considered a fad diet. As the name suggests, the cabbage soup diet requires that you eat large amounts of cabbage soup for a week. Proponents of the cabbage soup diet say it's a good way to lose weight fast, as much as 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) in seven days. Although it may help you lose weight in the short-term — as almost any low-calorie diet can — this diet doesn't help you make the lifestyle changes necessary for maintaining a healthy weight over the long term.

Variations of the cabbage soup diet have been around for years, written about online and in books. It's not clear where the cabbage soup diet originated. On the cabbage soup diet, you eat cabbage soup every day for seven days. During that time, you can also eat certain fruits and vegetables, beef, chicken and brown rice, according to a daily schedule. Because the cabbage soup diet is low in complex carbohydrates, protein, vitamins and minerals, you wouldn't want to stay on the cabbage soup diet for more than a week at a time. It should be followed by at least two weeks of a normal, balanced diet to ensure proper nutrition.

The cabbage soup diet has other disadvantages. Depending on the recipe for cabbage soup, the diet can be very high in sodium. The large amounts of cabbage also can make you more prone to flatulence. And if you're not getting proper nutrition, you may feel weak or tired while on the diet. In addition, the cabbage soup diet doesn't include physical activity and exercise.

Any time you drastically cut calories, you can lose weight. If you lose a lot of weight very quickly, though, it may not be fat that you're losing. It might be water weight or even lean tissue, since it's hard to burn that many fat calories in such a short period. And once you stop the diet, it's easy to regain any weight that you lost, especially on plans that don't include physical activity.

Remember, successful weight-loss programs address both diet and exercise and help you develop healthy lifelong habits that keep the weight off.

		What's the best way to treat cachexia in someone who has cancer?
	","
Cachexia is the loss of muscle mass and other lean tissues. Cachexia is common during the advanced stages of cancer, though it's unclear exactly how cancer causes muscle loss. Cachexia is also common in certain other chronic conditions, such as AIDS, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Cachexia is often accompanied by loss of appetite. The muscle loss isn't caused by not eating, however — it's caused by the cancer. Even people who receive nutritional support through feeding tubes or intravenous feedings during the late stages of cancer can experience cachexia.

The best way to ease cachexia is to treat the cancer. If the cancer is no longer responding to treatments, little can be done to treat cachexia directly.

Sometimes appetite stimulants such as megestrol or corticosteroids can improve a person's appetite. But even then, eating more doesn't typically help a person feel better — nor does it lead to regained muscle mass. In addition, appetite stimulants may have bothersome side effects, such as swelling, agitation and increased risk of blood clots.

If you're caring for a person who has advanced cancer, simply provide support. Allow the person to eat as desired for comfort or pleasure. Don't pressure the person into eating more.

		Does caffeine help with weight loss?
	","
Caffeine may slightly boost weight loss or prevent weight gain, but there's no sound evidence that increased caffeine consumption results in significant or permanent weight loss.

Caffeine is found in many beverages, including coffee, tea, energy drinks and colas; in products containing cocoa or chocolate; and in a variety of medications and dietary supplements, including supplements aimed at weight loss.

Although research about the connection between caffeine and weight isn't definitive, there are several theories about how caffeine might affect weight, including: 

Some studies looking at caffeine and weight were poor quality or done on animals, making the results questionable or hard to generalize to humans. In addition, some studies found that even decaffeinated coffee may contribute to modest weight loss, suggesting that substances or factors besides caffeine may play a role in weight loss.

The bottom line: Be cautious about using caffeine products to help with weight loss. When used in moderation, caffeine is generally safe. But too much caffeine might cause nervousness, insomnia, nausea, increased blood pressure and other problems. Also, some caffeinated beverages, such as specialty coffees, are high in calories and fat. So instead of losing weight, you might actually gain weight if you drink too many of these.

Caffeine impairs insulin action, but doesn't necessarily affect blood sugar (glucose) levels in young, healthy adults. However, if you have type 2 diabetes, the impact of caffeine on insulin action may be associated with a small, but detectable rise in blood sugar levels, particularly after meals. About 250 milligrams of caffeine — or the equivalent of 2 to 2 1/2 cups (473 to 591 milliliters) of plain, brewed coffee — a day may cause this effect. 

If you have type 2 diabetes and you're struggling to control your blood sugar levels, limiting the amount of caffeine in your diet may provide a benefit.

		How does caffeine affect blood pressure?
	","
Caffeine can cause a short, but dramatic increase in your blood pressure, even if you don't have high blood pressure. It's unclear what causes this spike in blood pressure. Caffeine could block a hormone that helps keep your arteries widened. Others think that caffeine causes your adrenal glands to release more adrenaline, which causes your blood pressure to increase. 

Some people who regularly drink caffeinated beverages have a higher average blood pressure than do those who drink none. Others who regularly drink caffeinated beverages develop a tolerance to it. As a result, caffeine doesn't have a long-term effect on their blood pressure. It seems that caffeine has a stronger blood pressure increasing effect in people who are older than 70 or who are overweight. 

If you have high blood pressure, ask your doctor whether you should limit or stop drinking caffeinated beverages. If you're concerned about caffeine's effect on your blood pressure, try limiting the amount of caffeine you drink to 200 milligrams a day — about the same amount as in two 12-ounce cups of brewed coffee. Keep in mind that the amount of caffeine in coffee and other beverages varies by brand. Also, avoid caffeine right before activities that naturally increase your blood pressure, such as exercise, weightlifting or hard physical labor. 

To see if caffeine might be raising your blood pressure, check your blood pressure within 30 to 60 minutes of drinking a cup of coffee or another caffeinated beverage. If your blood pressure increases by five to 10 points, you may be sensitive to the blood pressure raising effects of caffeine. If you plan to cut back on caffeine, do so gradually over several days to a week to avoid withdrawal headaches.

Some doctors think it's possible that taking calcium supplements may increase your risk of a heart attack. Other doctors believe that calcium supplements have little or no effect on your heart attack risk. 

There's concern about calcium supplements and heart attack risk because many women take calcium supplements to treat or prevent bone diseases such as osteoporosis. It's thought that the calcium in supplements could make its way into fatty plaques in your arteries — a condition called atherosclerosis — causing those plaques to harden and increase your risk of heart disease. 

More research is needed before doctors know the effect calcium supplements may have on your heart attack risk. The calcium supplements that some doctors are concerned about are those that contain only calcium — not supplements that combine calcium and vitamin D or multivitamin supplements.

There hasn't been a great deal of research on yoga for weight loss. In general, though, physical activity is better for preventing weight gain than it is for promoting weight loss, and it appears this also applies to yoga. Most types of yoga don't have the same level of calorie-burning power as does aerobic exercise. Consider that a 150-pound person will burn 240 calories in an hour of doing regular yoga, compared with 360 calories for an hour of aerobics. 

But any activity is good activity. Yoga will get you moving, after all, and it can provide health benefits such as improved blood lipid levels and enhanced mood.

Regular physical activity should be part of any weight-loss or weight management plan. To lose weight, you want to reduce the calories you take in (eating) and increase calories out (physical activity). If you want to use yoga for weight loss, the smart play is to include it in an exercise plan that includes aerobic activities, such as biking, jogging or swimming, which burn more calories.

		Can taking vitamins help prevent heart disease or a heart attack?
	","
It's uncertain whether taking vitamins can reduce your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. However, no matter what type of vitamins you take, vitamins won't prevent the development of heart disease if you don't control your other risk factors, such as poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, high cholesterol and diabetes. 

Some researchers think that certain vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, may reduce your heart disease risk. These vitamins may help prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol from producing plaques that can narrow your heart's arteries. The evidence for this benefit is limited, and the American Heart Association doesn't recommend taking vitamin C and E supplements as a way to prevent heart disease. 

Another vitamin that might improve your heart health is vitamin D. There's some evidence that vitamin D improves the health of your blood vessels, but nothing conclusive yet. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about your vitamin D level.

Vitamins can be an option for some people, especially if you're not getting enough nutrition from your diet. However, most generally healthy people don't need to take a daily vitamin because they get all the nutrients they need from their food. If you're concerned about your nutrition and diet, talk with your doctor about whether taking a daily vitamin might be a good option for you.

		Can eating more whole-grain foods help lower my blood pressure?
	","
It might. Eating more whole-grain foods on a regular basis may help reduce your chance of developing high blood pressure (hypertension). 

Whole grains are grains that include the entire grain kernel — they haven't had their bran and germ removed by refining. Whole-grain foods are a rich source of healthy nutrients, including fiber, potassium, magnesium and folate. Eating more whole-grain foods offers many health benefits that can work together to help reduce your risk of high blood pressure by: 

If you already have high blood pressure, eating more whole-grain foods might help lower your blood pressure and possibly reduce your need for blood pressure medication. 

According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as part of an overall healthy diet, adults should eat at least 85 grams of whole-grain foods a day — that's about 3 ounces, or the equivalent of three slices of whole-wheat bread.

		What is a candida cleanse diet and what does it do?
	","
Some complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners blame common symptoms such as fatigue, headache and poor memory on intestinal overgrowth of the fungus-like organism Candida albicans, or yeast syndrome. To cure the syndrome, they recommend a candida cleanse diet, which includes no sugar, white flour, yeast and cheese, on the theory that these foods promote candida overgrowth.

Unfortunately, there isn't much evidence to support the diagnosis of yeast syndrome. Consequently many conventional practitioners doubt its validity. And there are no clinical trials that document the efficacy of a candida cleanse diet for treating any recognized medical condition.

Not surprisingly, many people note improvement in various symptoms when following this diet. If you stop eating sugar and white flour, you'll generally wind up cutting out most processed foods, which tend to be high in calorie content and low in nutritive value. Within a few weeks of replacing processed foods with fresh ones and white flour with whole grains, you may start to feel better in general. That, rather than stopping the growth of yeast in the gastrointestinal tract, is the main benefit of a candida cleanse diet.

		How long can you safely keep canned food?
	","
Commercially prepared canned food has a fairly long shelf life, as long as it's stored properly. How long you can safely keep canned food depends on the type of food. According to the Department of Agriculture: 

When you're shopping for canned food, examine the containers. Don't buy canned products that are dented, leaking or bulging, or those that show any signs of tampering. 

At home, store canned food in a cool, dry place. Avoid cabinets over the stove, under the sink, or in a damp basement or garage. 

When you're preparing canned food, check the expiration date on the label to be assured of freshness. It's also a good idea to clean the top of the container before you open it. If the container spurts liquid or foam when you open it or the food has a foul odor, don't eat it. Simply throw the container and the food away.

		I've heard that canned pumpkin is healthier than fresh pumpkin. Is that true?
	","
Not necessarily. Fresh foods generally have a higher nutrient content than do cooked or canned foods. But in this case, both fresh pumpkin and canned pumpkin are packed with nutrients, such as potassium, vitamin A and iron.

If you want to use fresh pumpkin, look for pumpkins without blemishes that are firm and heavy for their size. Whole pumpkins can be stored in a cool dark place for up to two months. If you use fresh pumpkin for bread, soup, pie or other recipes, don't throw away the seeds. You can bake them for a wholesome, crispy snack.

If you're looking for convenience, canned pumpkin without salt is a healthy alternative. Just check the Nutrition Facts label on the can so that you know what you're getting. Canned pumpkin products may be labeled as ""pumpkin,"" ""100% pumpkin"" or ""pumpkin pie mix."" Canned pumpkin pie mix — which some recipes call for — can be much higher in calories than regular canned pumpkin.

		I read an article on the Internet that said canola oil contains toxins that are harmful to humans. Is this true?
	","
Health concerns about canola oil that are being circulated on the Internet are unfounded. 

Misinformation about the safety of canola oil may stem from the fact that, years ago, oil was produced from the rapeseed plant. Rapeseed oil contains very high levels of erucic acid, a compound that in large amounts can be toxic to humans. The canola plant was developed by natural crossbreeding from the rapeseed plant. Canola oil is produced from canola plants, not rapeseed plants. Canola plants have very low levels of erucic acid. 

Canola oil is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration. In fact, canola oil is very low in saturated fat and has a very high proportion of monounsaturated fat, so it's a healthy and safe choice when it comes to oils.

		I was taught to control my blood sugar by eating a certain amount of carbohydrates at every meal. Does this mean I can eat as many carb-free foods as I want?
	","
No, you don't have a pass to eat unlimited amounts of foods just because they're free of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates aren't your only dietary consideration. In addition to counting carbohydrates, you need to also limit fat and cholesterol and control the number of calories you consume. The best way to do this is to choose nutritious foods and control portion sizes. 

Eating a healthy diet helps you control your diabetes and reduces your risk of diabetes-related conditions, such as heart disease and stroke. Eating consistent amounts of foods containing carbohydrates every day helps you control your blood glucose level. This consistency each day is what matters most. Wide variations are difficult for the body to handle. Blood glucose levels that are outside the normal limits are the ones that cause long-term complications. 

Your best bet is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. For example: 

<strong>Example: Looking beyond carbs</strong> <br/>
Both of the following breakfasts provide the same amount of carbohydrates. However, breakfast No. 2 is a better choice because it's considerably lower in calories, fat and cholesterol.

		What is cardiac asthma?
	","
Cardiac asthma is not a form of asthma. It's a type of coughing or wheezing that's a symptom of heart failure. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, this wheezing can be a medical emergency.

As a result of heart failure, fluid can build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in and around your airways. This causes signs and symptoms — such as shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing — that may mimic asthma. Asthma is a chronic condition caused by inflammation of the airways, which can narrow them, leading to breathing difficulties. True asthma has nothing to do with fluid in the lungs or heart disease.

The distinction is important because treatments for asthma and heart failure are different. Treatments for heart failure, including medications, can help improve your symptoms for both the heart failure and the cardiac asthma. Overusing treatments for true asthma, such as rescue inhalers, may actually worsen cardiac asthma and could cause dangerous heart rhythms.

		I've been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Would regular hand and wrist exercises help me avoid surgery?
	","
Probably not. When used alone, carpal tunnel exercises aren't likely to relieve symptoms such as pain and numbness. And they don't replace other carpal tunnel treatments, such as surgery, behavior modification or wrist splints.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel and under the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist. A number of factors can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome, including the anatomy of your wrist, certain underlying health problems and possibly patterns of hand use.

Nerve-gliding exercises — one type of carpal tunnel exercise — are meant to help the median nerve move normally, but they can sometimes worsen symptoms. If a median nerve remains trapped, nerve-gliding exercises can stretch, irritate or injure the nerve.

Despite their limits, carpal tunnel exercises may be helpful in some situations: 

If your doctor recommends carpal tunnel exercises, start them gradually to ensure they don't cause more harm than good. 
"
I was recently diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Can I still lift weights with this condition?,"Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome result from irritation or compression of the median nerve. The median nerve passes through your carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in your wrist. Depending on how severe your carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms are, you may be able to participate in weight training exercise.The key is to keep your wrists rigid and unbending during all your lifts. Allowing your wrists to bend (flex) toward you during a lift puts increased pressure on your carpal tunnel. This may cause compression of your median nerve, which may worsen your symptoms. Also, the increase in blood flow to your muscles that normally occurs during weight training may also put increased pressure on your carpal tunnel.Let your symptoms be your guide. If weight training activities don't worsen your symptoms, you're probably safe to continue them. If you still have concerns, ask your doctor about whether weight training is appropriate in your specific situation."

		I recently had cataract surgery. How long does the artificial lens last? Also, will my vision deteriorate over time?
	","
In cataract surgery, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) removes the clouded lens from your eye and replaces it with a clear, artificial lens. This lens is very durable and should last for the rest of your life.

Your vision after cataract surgery generally doesn't deteriorate over time. However, sometimes the lens capsule that holds the implant becomes cloudy. In such cases, the cloudy capsule can easily be treated with a laser to make it clear again.

Most people will require glasses after cataract surgery — either for close-up work, distance vision or both. If you currently wear glasses, your prescription will likely require a correction for close-up work after surgery.

"Does the influenza virus cause death directly or only as a result of pneumonia? If the virus doesn't kill people directly, why not use the pneumococcal vaccine, which lasts several years, instead of the flu vaccine, which lasts one year?","You ask an insightful question. Influenza certainly kills directly from viral pneumonia but also indirectly through a number of other means. One of these is damage to the mechanism (mucociliary escalator) that the body uses to clear inhaled bacteria from the airways. This leads to an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia due to pneumococcus and other microorganisms such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> . Preventing influenza reduces the risk of these secondary infections.Interestingly, influenza vaccination has been found to reduce death from all causes, including heart attack (myocardial infarction). Severe influenza — with fever, chills and dehydration — can certainly challenge an impaired cardiovascular system.The bottom line is that people in the designated risk groups should get both vaccines — pneumococcal and yearly influenza — for maximum protection."

		I have celiac disease, and I find it difficult to get enough grains in my diet. Do you have any suggestions?
	","
Because people with celiac disease must avoid gluten — a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley and rye — it can be a challenge to get enough grains. 

Grains are an important part of a healthy diet. They are a good source of healthy carbohydrates, various vitamins and minerals, and fiber, and they are naturally low in fat. When possible, choose foods made with enriched flours for added vitamins and minerals. Whole grains are even better for you. These include brown or wild rice, quinoa, amaranth, pure buckwheat, flax, whole corn, millet, gluten-free oats, sorghum and teff. 

Many large grocery stores and specialty food stores carry ready-to-eat gluten-free grain products. The labels on such products will state that the product is ""gluten-free."" Consider the suggestions in the chart below for adding gluten-free grains to your diet. 

*Products vary by manufacturer, so be sure that the brand you purchase is gluten-free. Shopping guides that list gluten-free products are available. Check with a registered dietitian or celiac disease support group. 

Oats may not be harmful for most people with celiac disease. However, oat products are frequently contaminated with wheat, so it's best to avoid oats. If your doctor or dietitian suggests trying oats, be sure to look for oats from a reputable gluten-free supplier. 

Most gluten-free grain products aren't supplemented with vitamins, so it's a good idea to take a vitamin supplement. 

Grain products that are not gluten-free include any type of wheat (including farina, graham flour, semolina and durum), barley, rye, bulgur, Kamut, kasha, matzo meal, spelt, triticale, couscous, emmer and einkorn.

		I have celiac disease. Do I need to be concerned about sunscreens, shampoos and cosmetics that contain gluten?
	","
No. Gluten-containing skin care products and cosmetics aren't a problem unless you accidentally swallow them. For this reason, avoid using such products on your lips or around your mouth. Also, avoid using gluten-containing dental products, such as certain mouthwashes and toothpastes. If you're uncertain about whether a product contains gluten, check the ingredient list on the product label or contact the manufacturer. 

Some people develop a form of celiac disease called dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which causes an itchy, blistering rash. This skin disorder is also linked to gluten intolerance. But although it involves the skin, DH is caused by ingesting gluten, not by skin contact with gluten. So, eliminating gluten from your diet will help clear up DH as well. 

If you use a cosmetic or skin care product that contains gluten and you develop a skin reaction, see your doctor or dermatologist to identify the cause. It is possible to have an allergy to wheat or another grain that could cause a skin reaction.

		Is there any link between cellphones and cancer?
	","
The possible connection between cellphones and cancer is controversial. Many years' worth of studies on cellphones and cancer have yielded conflicting results. Currently, there's no consensus about the degree of cancer risk — if any — posed by cellphone use. 

The primary concern with cellphones and cancer seems to be the development of brain tumors associated with cellphone use. Some research suggests a slight increase in the rate of brain tumors since the 1970s, but cellphones weren't in use during the 1970s. Instead, the subtle increases are more likely related to other factors — such as increased access to medical care and improvements in diagnostic imaging. 

So what have researchers learned about cellphones and cancer? Here's an overview of various studies: 

After evaluating several studies on the possibility of a connection between cellphones and glioma and a noncancerous brain tumor known as acoustic neuroma, members of the International Agency for Research on Cancer — part of the World Health Organization — agreed that there's limited evidence that cellphone radiation is a cancer-causing agent (carcinogenic). As a result, the group classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to people. 

Still, a series of recent studies can't tell the entire story. It often takes many years between the use of a new cancer-causing agent — such as tobacco — and the observation of an increase in cancer rates. At this point, it's possible that too little time has passed to detect an increase in cancer rates directly attributable to cellphone use. 

The bottom line? For now, no one knows if cellphones are capable of causing cancer. Although long-term studies are ongoing, to date there's no convincing evidence that cellphone use increases the risk of cancer. If you're concerned about the possible link between cellphones and cancer, consider limiting your use of cellphones — or use a speaker or hands-free device that places the cellphone antenna, which is typically in the cellphone itself, away from your head.

		My husband has had cellulitis three times in a single year — and in three different parts of his body. What can he do to treat his cellulitis?
	","
Cellulitis is a bacterial infection in the deepest layer of skin. Cellulitis develops when bacteria enter the body through a crack or cut in the skin. Sometimes cellulitis recurs.

Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics. It's important to take the antibiotics exactly as prescribed — including finishing the full course of antibiotics, even if signs and symptoms have already improved. To relieve discomfort associated with cellulitis, keep the affected area elevated if possible. A cool wet dressing or clean cloth applied to the affected area and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) also may help relieve pain and swelling.

To help prevent recurrent episodes of cellulitis, keep skin clean and well moisturized. Be sure to treat athlete's foot because it can allow penetration of infection-causing bacteria. Prevent cuts and scrapes by wearing appropriate clothing and footwear, using gloves when necessary, and trimming fingernails and toenails with care. Seek prompt medical attention at the first sign of a skin infection of the hands or feet.

Recurrent cellulitis can also be a sign of an immune system problem, for example diabetes. Your husband should be examined carefully to see if a source for this infection can be determined (for example, athlete's foot). You might also encourage your husband to ask his doctor about long-term antibiotic treatment. Some people who have recurrent cellulitis may benefit from long-term antibiotic treatment to prevent recurrent infections.

"
		Can cervical cysts be cancerous?
	","
Cervical cysts — mucus-filled lumps that form on the cervix — are rarely cancerous. These cysts form when normal tissue on the outer part of the cervix (squamous epithelium) grows over the glandular, mucus-producing tissue of the inner part of the cervix (endocervical canal), trapping mucus and forming cysts. 

Cervical cysts often are discovered incidentally during a pelvic exam. They generally don't cause symptoms and require no treatment. 

If a cervical cyst looks unusual to your doctor, or you also have signs and symptoms that suggest cervical cancer — for instance, abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic pain, or pain during intercourse — your doctor may perform a biopsy of your cervix.

		I had a Pap smear recently, and my doctor said the results showed cervical dysplasia. What does that mean? Is it cancer?
	","
No. Cervical dysplasia isn't cancer. The term indicates that abnormal cells were found on the surface of the cervix. 

Cervical dysplasia can range from mild to severe, depending on the appearance of the abnormal cells. Dysplasia could go away on its own or, rarely, it could develop into cancer. Another term for cervical dysplasia is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. 

<strong>Tests to determine the severity of cervical dysplasia</strong> <br/>
After an abnormality is detected on a Pap smear, your doctor may recommend more tests, including a human papillomavirus (HPV) test and colposcopy. Colposcopy is an examination of your cervix, vagina and vulva using a magnifying instrument. During a colposcopic examination, your doctor may determine where the abnormal cells are growing and the degree of abnormality. A sample of cells (biopsy) may be taken for testing. 

<strong>Treatment and follow-up for cervical dysplasia</strong> <br/>
Often, with mild dysplasia, no treatment is needed. In most cases, mild dysplasia resolves on its own and doesn't become cancerous. Your doctor may recommend follow-up in six to 12 months to check for additional changes. If you have severe dysplasia, your doctor may recommend treatment such as surgery or other procedures to remove the abnormal cells. 

Whether you have mild or severe dysplasia, it's likely your doctor will recommend Pap testing every six months or, with mild dysplasia, HPV testing yearly to monitor your condition and check for recurrences of dysplasia. After two consecutive normal Pap smears, your doctor will likely recommend resuming annual Pap smears if you've had severe dysplasia, and Pap smears every one to three years if you've had mild dysplasia.

		Can chemotherapy side effects increase the risk of heart disease?
	","
Chemotherapy side effects may increase the risk of heart disease, including weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). Certain types of chemotherapy also may increase the risk of heart attack. Treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors and certain other targeted medications has been linked to high blood pressure (hypertension). Fortunately, heart disease associated with chemotherapy is rare — and not all chemotherapy drugs carry the potential side effect of heart damage. 

Some anti-cancer treatments — including a class of drugs known as anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, others), as well as newer medications such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast and other cancers — may cause heart damage by weakening the heart muscle. The chance of heart damage from anthracyclines is related to the total amount received during your lifetime. Your doctor will carefully monitor how much of these drugs you receive. Heart weakening from trastuzumab is not related to total lifetime dose and is often reversible. 

Certain chemotherapy medications such as taxanes can cause an abnormal heart rhythm. This typically occurs temporarily during administration of the medication, so if you feel lightheaded or faint, be sure to tell your chemotherapy nurse or doctor. 

If your doctor is considering using a chemotherapy drug that may affect your heart, you may undergo heart function testing before starting treatment. During treatment, you may need periodic heart monitoring as well. If you have a pre-existing heart condition, such as cardiomyopathy, your doctor may suggest a different type of chemotherapy. If you experience significant problems such as shortness of breath with minimal exertion or chest pain during chemotherapy, report it immediately to your health care team. 

In addition, some cancers require radiation therapy. If the area of your body receiving radiation includes your heart, you have an increased risk of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and heart attack. The combination of radiation and chemotherapy can further increase your risk of heart damage. However, your doctor can take steps to reduce these risks as much as possible.

What is Arnold-Chiari malformation?,"Chiari malformation, also called Arnold-Chiari malformation, is a rare abnormality at the base of the brain that results in brain tissue extending into the upper end of the spinal canal. It may be present at birth (congenital). Chiari malformation is unrelated to Budd-Chiari syndrome, a blockage of the hepatic vein that carries blood away from the liver.Chiari malformation is divided into several types based on the degree of displacement of the brain tissue into the spinal canal. The most common are Chiari malformation type I and Chiari malformation type II.In Chiari-I malformation, brain tissue (cerebellar tonsils) protrudes below the opening of the base of the skull (foramen magnum) into the spinal canal. This puts pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord. Chiari-I malformation may also cause displacement of the lower part of the brainstem (medulla). Chiari-I may be associated with:Some people with Chiari-I have no symptoms. But in others, signs and symptoms may include:Because cerebrospinal fluid can't drain properly, excess fluid may build up in the brain (hydrocephalus). This usually requires the surgical placement of a shunt system to divert cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body.Chiari-II malformation involves a greater degree of brain tissue protruding into the spinal canal. In addition to the cerebellar tonsils, Chiari-II also includes the medulla and a cavity of the brain called the fourth ventricle. Signs and symptoms are similar to Chiari-I. But Chiari-II is usually associated with myelomeningocele, a form of spina bifida.A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of Chiari malformation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull. Treatment may be considered if symptoms warrant it. The goal of treatment is to halt or reverse the progression of signs and symptoms. Typically, treatment is surgery to relieve crowding at the back of the brain (cerebellum). The success of treatment depends on the individual's specific situation. Surgery may improve some of the signs and symptoms."

		What are the risks associated with chickenpox and pregnancy?
	","
Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral illness that causes an itchy rash. If you develop chickenpox (varicella) during pregnancy, the risks depend on the timing.

If chickenpox develops during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy — particularly between weeks 8 and 20 — the baby faces a slight risk of a rare group of serious birth defects known as congenital varicella syndrome. A baby who has congenital varicella syndrome may develop:

The second window of vulnerability is at the end of pregnancy. If chickenpox develops during the few days before delivery, the baby may be born with a potentially life-threatening infection.

Most pregnant women are immune to chickenpox, due to either immunization or a childhood bout with chickenpox. If you're considering pregnancy and you're not immune to chickenpox, ask your health care provider about the chickenpox vaccine. It's safe for adults, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends waiting at least four weeks after vaccination before trying to conceive. If you're unsure of your immunity, your health care provider can do a simple blood test to find out.

If you develop chickenpox at any point during pregnancy, you're at high risk of potentially serious complications — such as pneumonia. If you're exposed to chickenpox during pregnancy and you're not immune to the illness, contact your health care provider immediately. He or she may recommend an injection of an immune globulin product that contains antibodies to the chickenpox virus. When given within 96 hours after exposure, the immune globulin can prevent chickenpox or reduce its severity. Unfortunately, it isn't clear if this treatment helps protect the developing baby.

If you develop chickenpox during pregnancy, your health care provider may prescribe oral antiviral drugs to reduce the severity of the illness, as well as the risk of complications.

If your baby is born with chickenpox, he or she may be treated with an immune globulin shortly after birth. When given promptly, the immune globulin usually reduces the severity of the illness. If needed, antiviral drugs may be given as well.

		A friend told me that chocolate impairs absorption of calcium. Is this true?
	","
Chocolate contains oxalate — a naturally occurring compound in cocoa beans — which can inhibit the absorption of calcium. The jury is still out, however, on whether chocolate causes problems for healthy people who eat calcium-rich diets. 

The concern about calcium absorption and bone health comes from a 2008 study. It found that older women who ate one or more servings of chocolate a day had lower bone density and less strength than did women who ate fewer servings of chocolate. Researchers believe this may be due to oxalate inhibiting calcium absorption — but it could also be due to the chocolate's sugar content, which may increase calcium excretion. 

On the plus side, dark chocolate (or cocoa) contains flavonoids, which are thought to be beneficial to health. Further research is needed to fully determine the role chocolate plays in calcium balance and bone health. 

In the meantime, if you get the daily recommended amounts of calcium and vitamin D from food or supplements, and practice weight-bearing exercise, eating chocolate in moderation is unlikely to adversely affect your bone health.

		How important is cholesterol ratio?
	","
Calculating your cholesterol ratio can provide useful information about your heart disease risk, but it isn't useful for deciding what treatment you should have to reduce your heart disease risk. Your total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol levels are more useful in guiding treatment than is your cholesterol ratio.

You can calculate your cholesterol ratio by dividing your high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or ""good"") cholesterol into your total cholesterol. For example, if your total cholesterol is 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (5.2 millimoles per liter, or mmol/L) and your HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L), your cholesterol ratio is 4-to-1. According to the American Heart Association, the goal is to keep your cholesterol ratio 5-to-1 or lower. An optimum ratio is 3.5-to-1. A higher ratio indicates a higher risk of heart disease; a lower ratio indicates a lower risk.

For treatment purposes, it's important to know absolute numbers for all your cholesterol levels. People with very low HDL levels or very high LDL levels may be at substantial risk. There are effective ways to lower LDL cholesterol that are proven to reduce risk.

		Are home cholesterol test kits accurate?
	","
Home cholesterol test kits don't substitute for a cholesterol test performed by medical professionals. The accuracy of home cholesterol test kits varies considerably, and your results can't offer a complete picture of your risk of developing heart disease.

Home cholesterol test kits are widely available. Many cholesterol test kits measure only total cholesterol. But a few also measure high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides — a type of fat found in the blood. Although home cholesterol testing seems fast and easy, it's important to regard the results with caution.

Even when cholesterol testing is done by trained professionals in a lab, your test results can vary. The variability may be even greater with home cholesterol test kits, especially if you're not fasting when you take the test, or if you don't precisely follow the directions on the test packaging.

Remember, cholesterol management requires more than simply measuring total cholesterol. Your doctor can help you figure out how to best manage your cholesterol numbers. And even then, consider other factors — such as family history, smoking and high blood pressure — when deciding how to maintain your heart's health.

Someone told my husband that he shouldn't take chondroitin supplements because they can cause prostate cancer. Is this true?,"There's no evidence that chondroitin or chondroitin supplements cause prostate cancer. Chondroitin sulfate is a substance found naturally in your body. Researchers believe that it may help repair and maintain cartilage.Some preliminary research has found higher concentrations of chondroitin in cancerous prostate tissue than in normal prostate tissue. This research also suggests that higher concentrations in the tissue surrounding the prostate tumor may predict a more aggressive cancer. However, the study didn't identify the source of the chondroitin in the tumors. Simply because a substance is present in or around cancerous tissue doesn't by itself suggest that the substance is causing the cancer.Further research is needed to identify any potential relationship between prostate cancer and chondroitin. If you're at increased risk of prostate cancer, it's reasonable to not take chondroitin supplements. If you take chondroitin for arthritis pain and are at high risk of prostate cancer, discuss alternative arthritis treatments with your doctor."

		When you're choosing sunglasses, does UV protection matter?
	","
Yes, ultraviolet (UV) eye protection matters. UV radiation from the sun can damage not only the skin of your eyelid but also the cornea, lens and other parts of the eye. UV exposure also contributes to the development of certain types of cataracts. 

When you're choosing sunglasses, look for UV-protection details on product labels. Choose sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays. Skip sunglasses that are labeled ""cosmetic"" and those that don't offer details on UV protection. Opt for larger lenses rather than smaller lenses — or, better yet, the wraparound variety. 

Of course, UV protection isn't the only consideration when it comes to selecting sunglasses. In addition to UV protection, here's the lowdown on other options: 

Standard prescription eyeglasses can be treated with a material that provides UV protection while retaining a clear, nontinted appearance. Some contact lenses also offer UV protection — but because contact lenses don't cover the entire eye, it's still important to wear sunglasses for UV protection when you're outdoors.

		Can chronic stress cause depression?
	","
Depression has many possible causes, such as genetics, brain chemicals and your life situation. Chronic stressful life situations can increase the risk of developing depression if you aren't coping with the stress well. There's also increasing evidence of links among poor coping, stress and physical illness. 

Stress is a normal psychological and physical reaction to positive or negative situations in your life, such as a new job or the death of a loved one. Stress itself isn't abnormal or bad. What's important is how you deal with stress. 

If you're having trouble coping, chronic stress can wear you down and overwhelm you. You may frequently be in a bad mood, your productivity may decrease, your relationships may suffer, and you might even find it difficult to go about your normal daily routine.

You can try some self-help stress relievers to get your stress under control, such as meditation, yoga, exercise or simply cutting back on your obligations. If your stress management efforts aren't helpful enough, see your doctor. If you've developed depression, you and your doctor can discuss treatment options.

In addition, some centers and programs, such as Curves, provide this type of exercise session for women only, which many find appealing.Circuit training programs have several advantages. Circuit training can help improve strength and muscle endurance. Because you move through the exercises quickly, you don't have to spend long hours in the gym. Also, the range of exercises provided by a circuit training program can help prevent boredom — which makes you more likely to stick with it.In addition, if you move quickly through the circuit exercises, you will get some aerobic benefits as well.

		What does the term ""clinical depression"" mean?
	","
Depression ranges in seriousness from mild, temporary episodes of sadness to severe, persistent depression. Doctors use the term ""clinical depression"" to describe the more severe form of depression also known as ""major depression"" or ""major depressive disorder."" 

For a diagnosis of clinical depression, you must meet the symptom criteria spelled out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a guidebook used to diagnose mental illness in the United States.

Clinical depression symptoms may include: 

To meet the criteria for clinical depression (called major depression in the DSM), you must have five or more of the above symptoms over a two-week period. At least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure. Keep in mind, some types of depression may not fit this strict definition.

Clinical depression causes noticeable disruptions in daily life, such as work, school or social activities. It can affect people of any age or sex, including children. It isn't the same as depression caused by a loss (such as the death of a loved one), substance abuse or a medical condition such as a thyroid disorder.

Clinical depression symptoms usually improve with psychological counseling, antidepressant medications or a combination of the two. Even severe depression symptoms usually improve with treatment.

		I'm considering getting hearing aids, but have heard about cochlear implants as an option. Who are they for?
	","
Cochlear implants — which bypass damaged or nonworking parts of the inner ear — can improve hearing if you have severe to profound hearing loss. Cochlear implants are electronic devices that convert acoustic sounds into electrical pulses that stimulate the auditory nerve directly. Your auditory nerve carries the signal to your brain, which recognizes the signal as sound. 

If your hearing loss is severe, you may be a candidate for cochlear implants. Cochlear implant candidates generally have great difficulty understanding speech in everyday listening situations — even with hearing aids. Cochlear implants cannot restore ""normal"" hearing. But with communication training, children as young as 12 months of age and adults who have lost their hearing can benefit. 

Communication training teaches you how to associate different signals from the cochlear implant with speech and environmental sounds. This process takes time and practice — from a few months to a period of years — and results won't be the same for everyone. Children are generally more adaptable and learn more easily than adults do, so they may achieve the most benefit. 

An audiologist — a specialist in hearing loss and hearing aids — and a medical doctor who specializes in disorders of the ears, nose and throat (ENT) can complete an evaluation to determine whether you are a candidate for a cochlear implant. If you are a good candidate for an implant, your audiologist and ENT doctor will discuss the risks and benefits as well as potential costs with you.

		Can coconut oil help me lose weight?
	","
The few small studies that have looked at coconut oil and weight loss suggest that coconut oil may help reduce waist size, but it doesn't lead to significant weight loss or improved body mass index (BMI). 

Coconut oil is a tropical oil that's made from the dried fruit (nut) of the coconut palm tree. Proponents say that it contains a healthy type of fatty acid that your body quickly burns for energy. The oil extracted from fresh coconut contains medium chain fatty acids, which aren't stored in adipose tissue. 

However, coconut oil is high in calories and saturated fat. One tablespoon contains 117 calories and 13.6 grams of fat. Coconut oil has more saturated fat than lard does. 

Although eating coconut oil in moderation isn't likely to harm your health, it's not likely to help you lose weight either. For successful, long-term weight loss, stick to the basics — an overall healthy-eating plan and exercise.

		Can coenzyme Q10 reduce the risk of serious side effects from statin medications?
	","
At this time, coenzyme Q10 is not universally recommended for preventing statin side effects.

Coenzyme Q10 is a substance made naturally by your body. As a supplement, it's usually sold as a capsule and is marketed under brand names such as Co-Q10, Coenzyme Q10, LiQsorb, Liquid Co-Q10 and Q-Gel.

Some researchers think that taking a coenzyme Q10 supplement may reduce the risk of serious muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis). And some small reports suggest that troubling side effects — muscle and joint aches — from statins might be reduced if you take coenzyme Q10 along with a statin. However, no large studies have confirmed this theory, so current guidelines don't recommend routine use of coenzyme Q10 in people taking statins.

Coenzyme Q10 doesn't cause side effects for most people. However, as with other herbal and dietary supplements, it's not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

If you have muscle aches or other troubling symptoms after starting statin medications, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering medications for many people, and it's important to do everything possible to continue taking them as directed.

		What does the research say about coffee and health? Is coffee good or bad for me?
	","
Coffee has a long history of being blamed for many ills — from the humorous ""It will stunt your growth"" to the not-so-humorous claim that it causes heart disease and cancer. But recent research indicates that coffee may not be so bad after all. So which is it — good or bad? The best answer may be that for most people the health benefits outweigh the risks.

Recent studies have generally found no connection between coffee and an increased risk of cancer or heart disease. Why the apparent reversal in the thinking about coffee? Earlier studies didn't always take into account that known high-risk behaviors, such as smoking and physical inactivity, tended to be more common among heavy coffee drinkers at that time.

However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee is associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. And another study found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk.

Newer studies have also shown that coffee may have benefits, such as protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver cancer. And it has a high content of antioxidants. But this doesn't mean you should disregard the old maxim ""Everything in moderation."" Although coffee may not be very harmful, other beverages such as milk and juice contain nutrients that coffee does not. Also, keep in mind that coffee accompaniments such as cream and sugar add fat and calories to your diet. Finally, heavy caffeine use — on the order of four to seven cups of coffee a day — can cause problems such as restlessness, anxiety, irritability and sleeplessness, particularly in susceptible individuals.

Treatment of a common cold may include rest, pain relievers and over-the-counter cold remedies, such as decongestants. Treatment of seasonal allergies may include over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines, nasal steroid sprays and decongestants, and avoidance of exposure to allergens where possible.

		My dad takes colloidal silver for his health, but is it safe?
	","
Colloidal silver isn't considered safe or effective for any of the health claims manufacturers make. Silver has no known purpose in the body. Nor is it an essential mineral, as some sellers of silver products claim.

Colloidal silver products are made of tiny silver particles suspended in a liquid — the same type of precious metal used in jewelry, dental fillings, silverware and other consumer goods. Colloidal silver products are usually marketed as dietary supplements that are taken by mouth. Colloidal silver products also come in forms to be injected or applied to the skin.

Manufacturers of colloidal silver products often claim that they are cure-alls, boosting your immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments and prostatitis. However, no sound scientific studies to evaluate these health claims have been published in reputable medical journals. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration has taken action against some manufacturers of colloidal silver products for making unproven health claims.

It's not clear how much colloidal silver may be harmful, but it can build up in your body's tissues over months or years. Most commonly, this results in argyria (ahr-JIR-e-uh), a blue-gray discoloration of your skin, eyes, internal organs, nails and gums. While argyria doesn't pose a serious health problem, it can be a cosmetic concern because it doesn't go away when you stop taking silver products.

Rarely, excessive doses of colloidal silver can cause possibly irreversible serious health problems, including kidney damage and neurological problems such as seizures. Colloidal silver products may also interact with medications, including penicillamine, quinolone, tetracycline and thyroxine medications.

People older than age 75 who have been getting regular colon cancer screening since age 50 and who have had consistently negative screenings — no polyps (adenomas) or colon cancer — need not continue getting routine screening. That's according to colon cancer screening guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The upper age limit was set after studies determined that the net benefit of screening after age 75 was small. However, the USPSTF guidelines do recommend colon cancer surveillance for people over age 75 who have an increased risk of colon cancer, such as family history, a previously diagnosed colon cancer or adenomatous polyps. 

The American Cancer Society and the American College of Gastroenterology do not specify an upper age limit beyond which colon cancer screening is no longer recommended. 

The USPSTF recommends that colon cancer screening be done using high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy with FOBT or colonoscopy.

		I'm concerned about childhood head injuries caused by contact sports. What are the possible effects of concussion in children?
	","
Most sports-related head injuries, such as concussions — which temporarily interfere with the way the brain works — are mild and allow for complete recovery. However, concussion in children also can pose serious health risks, ranging from temporary memory lapses to fatal brain swelling. Also, concussion in children sometimes goes unrecognized, as symptoms may not be noticed right after the injury. 

Head injuries take time to heal. Your child will need time to rest until his or her symptoms are completely gone, which usually takes several days. Your child should rest from both physical and thinking (cognitive) activities, as these can worsen symptoms. 

After your child's head injury, your child risks other complications if he or she returns to sports and other activities before his or her concussion has healed. Another blow to the head while the initial concussion is healing can occasionally result in fatal brain swelling — a condition known as second impact syndrome. Also, a young athlete who sustains a concussion is at risk of developing postconcussion syndrome, which is characterized by persistent concussion symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, irritability and difficulty with thinking skills, such as memory and attention. These symptoms can be particularly confusing for a child, as well as his or her family and teachers, if the child doesn't realize he or she has had a concussion. Researchers continue to study other potential long-term effects of concussions. Once a child has sustained his or her first concussion, he or she is at a higher risk of sustaining another. The effects of multiple concussions over years can be cumulative. 

To protect your child from head injuries, insist on appropriate and properly fitted protective equipment — such as a helmet — during sports and other activities. However, helmets and mouth guards don't protect against all concussions. Also, make sure your child knows that even a mild bump or blow to the head can cause a concussion, and that concussions don't always involve a loss of consciousness. Signs and symptoms of a concussion may include: 

If you think your child has sustained a concussion, seek medical help immediately. Your child's doctor will determine how serious the concussion is and when it's safe for your child to return to sports, school or other activities.

		How are conflicting screening mammograms resolved, especially when they were done at different facilities with film and digital techniques?
	","
The answer to your question isn't straightforward. Most abnormalities found on screening mammograms turn out to be insignificant — in other words, not breast cancer — when additional views are completed. In most cases, it doesn't matter whether the mammogram is digital or film. 

What's most important is whether the second facility reviewed the images from your first mammogram. This is necessary to understand what the original concern was, and to determine what additional imaging may be required. You may need more mammogram images, evaluation with other types of imaging tests such as ultrasound, nuclear medicine or MRI, or very rarely a biopsy. If the second facility didn't have the images from your first mammogram, it would be best to return to the first facility for a follow-up exam. Or you can have the images from the second facility sent to the first facility for review in order to decide if you need additional imaging. 

It also may be helpful for the radiologist who reads the mammograms to compare the current mammograms with your past mammograms to assess whether the area of concern is stable or new. Another important piece of information in the evaluation of an abnormal mammogram is to find out if you have noticed a new change such as a breast lump or mass, or if your doctor has detected an abnormality during a recent clinical breast examination. 

If you are still uncomfortable with the radiology report, then you may wish to get another opinion at a breast center. A short-term follow-up in six months may be recommended to assess for stability and determine if an additional work-up including a biopsy is necessary.

But if you have new or worsening symptoms — such as shortness of breath, new swelling in your legs, or breathlessness after climbing a flight of stairs — you should discuss your travel plans and the potential need for supplemental oxygen with your doctor.If your doctor recommends supplemental oxygen for your flight, be sure to contact the airline at least two weeks in advance of your trip so that you can make appropriate arrangements.

Ironically, medications used to treat these behavioral problems can worsen constipation.Increasing fluids usually helps relieve constipation. However, frequent and persistent constipation should be evaluated by a doctor. Often, the cause of constipation is treatable. Treatment may include:Constipation is a common complication of some other neurological disorders — such as Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia — which affect the nerves involved in digestion."

		Is it true that certain foods worsen anxiety and others have a calming effect?
	","
Coping with anxiety can be a challenge and often requires making lifestyle changes. There aren't any diet changes that can cure anxiety, but watching what you eat may help. Try these steps: 

Changes to your diet may make some difference to your general mood or sense of well-being but are not a substitute for treatment. If your anxiety is severe or interferes with your day-to-day activities or enjoyment of life, you may need medication, counseling (psychotherapy) or other treatment.

		Is it normal to have pain after breast surgery? I had a mastectomy two years ago. How can I cope?
	","
You're not alone in having pain after breast surgery. Studies of women who had a variety of breast cancer operations found that between 25 and 50 percent reported some level of pain after breast surgery two to three years later. 

Breast cancer surgery can be complicated, and nerve damage may occur. This can lead to chest pain, including phantom breast pain and supersensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia). Normally painless stimuli may now be perceived as painful (allodynia). Neuromas — abnormal nerve growths in an area where scar tissue and nerves grow together — can give rise to allodynia. Sensations of burning and constricting or lancing-type pain also may occur, as can a loss of feeling in the area of the surgery. 

Treatment for breast pain after surgery depends on the type of pain you're experiencing. 

Alternative therapies including acupuncture, acupressure, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis and yoga also may be of benefit in reducing pain. Talk with your doctor about what may offer you the most relief.

		What is cord blood banking — and is it better to use a public or private facility?
	","
Cord blood banking is a procedure in which cord blood — a rich source of stem cells — is taken from a newborn's umbilical cord after delivery and preserved for possible future use in a stem cell transplant. Collecting a baby's cord blood poses few, if any, risks to either mother or baby. If you're considering cord blood banking, the choice between a public and private facility is up to you.

If you'd like your baby's cord blood to be available for research or public use, you might consider using a public cord blood banking facility. Cord blood transplants from unrelated donors can be used to treat many conditions, ranging from leukemia and various metabolic conditions to cerebral palsy. You won't be charged any fees to donate cord blood to a public bank. However, you may need to deliver your baby at a hospital or other facility specifically equipped to handle public cord blood donations. Cord blood banked in a public program won't likely be available for future private use.

If you're interested in preserving your baby's cord blood for possible personal use, you might consider using a private cord blood banking facility. This type of cord blood banking is more controversial. The cost can be considerable, including an initial collection fee and ongoing maintenance fees — yet the chance that your child will use his or her own banked cord blood in the future is remote. Also, should your child need a stem cell transplant at some point, there's no guarantee that his or her banked cord blood will remain viable or be suitable for a transplant.

If a baby's cord blood isn't collected for preservation or research, it's simply discarded.

If you'd like to know more about public cord blood banking or wonder whether private cord blood banking would be a worthwhile investment for your family, consult your health care provider. He or she can help you understand the options and make an informed decision.

		I'm getting a cardiac catheterization. If blockages are found, what's the best treatment, angioplasty or stenting?
	","
During cardiac catheterization, your doctor will examine images of the inside of your coronary arteries. If cholesterol plaques in these arteries (coronary artery disease) have caused areas of narrowing, treatment options depend on various factors, including: 

For some people, medications and lifestyle changes may be the treatment of choice — especially if only one artery is narrowed. 

In other cases, angioplasty may be recommended to open the clogged arteries — especially if blood flow to the heart is reduced while you're at rest. During angioplasty, a tiny balloon is inserted and expanded at the site of the blockage to widen the narrowed artery. Typically, a small metal coil called a stent is implanted in the clogged artery to help prop the artery open and reduce the risk of it narrowing again. It's possible you may even have angioplasty during your cardiac catheterization, if your doctor thinks it's the best treatment option for you. 

If your arteries are narrowed or blocked in multiple areas, coronary bypass surgery may be necessary. During bypass surgery, a section of healthy blood vessel — often taken from inside the chest wall or the lower leg — is attached above and below the blocked artery. This allows blood to bypass the blocked area and flow to the heart muscle.

		What is a coronary artery spasm?
	","
A coronary artery spasm is a temporary tightening (constriction) of the muscles in the wall of one of the arteries that supplies blood flow to your heart muscle. This can narrow and decrease or even completely prevent blood flow to part of the heart muscle. 

If the spasm lasts long enough, it can lead to chest pain (angina) and even a heart attack (myocardial infarction). These spasms are sometimes referred to as Prinzmetal's angina or variant angina. Unlike typical angina, which usually occurs with physical activity, coronary artery spasms often occur at rest. 

Coronary artery spasms are more common in people with risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, but the spasms can happen in people who have no risk factors, too. Coronary artery spasms can also occur in people who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as lupus. 

Coronary artery spasms may be triggered by: 

Treatment of coronary artery spasms may include medications such as: 

You can reduce your risk of coronary artery spasms by quitting smoking and controlling high cholesterol and high blood pressure.

What are the effects of corticosteroid medications on potassium levels in the body?,"Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of illnesses. But like most medications, corticosteroids also carry a risk of certain side effects. One potential side effect of high-dose corticosteroids is low potassium (hypokalemia).Some corticosteroids may increase the amount of potassium excreted by your kidneys, which may lower potassium levels in your body. However, this reduction in potassium usually isn't serious and doesn't require treatment.Examples of corticosteroids with a potassium-lowering effect include fludrocortisone (Florinef) and hydrocortisone (Cortef). It should be noted that this effect occurs only with very high doses of these medications.Some corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone (Medrol) and dexamethasone (Decadron), have little or no effect on potassium levels. Also, inhaled corticosteroids and corticosteroids applied to the skin do not affect potassium levels.A very low potassium level is life-threatening. Signs and symptoms of severe hypokalemia include weakness, muscle cramps, constipation and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)."
"Can corticosteroids, such as prednisone, taken for asthma cause infertility in women?","Low-dose treatment with corticosteroids, such as for asthma, is unlikely to cause infertility — especially if you have regular periods. But very high doses may impair ovulation, causing irregular menstruation. In people with certain medical conditions, such as mild congenital adrenal hyperplasia or sperm antibodies, corticosteroid treatment may actually improve fertility.If you require ongoing corticosteroid treatment for a chronic disease, discuss your plans for conception with your doctor."

		Can cortisol blockers such as CortiSlim help me lose weight?
	","
There is no solid evidence that cortisol blockers such as CortiSlim lead to weight loss. 

Manufacturers of cortisol blockers claim that high stress levels increase your body's production of the hormone cortisol, which in turns increases appetite and weight gain. However, the connection between stress hormones and weight gain is largely based on anecdotal evidence, with only a few studies supporting it. More important, there's no evidence that blocking cortisol results in weight loss.

Indeed the Federal Trade Commission charged the marketers of some cortisol blockers with making false and unsubstantiated claims about their products' effectiveness for weight loss. As a result, the companies had to pay millions of dollars in refunds and to stop making unproven claims about their products.

Bottom line: Steer clear of weight-loss products that make unproven claims. Instead, focus on reducing your calorie intake and increasing your activity level.

		What can you tell me about Couvade syndrome? Can men really experience sympathetic pregnancy symptoms?
	","
Couvade syndrome is a term used to describe a situation in which an otherwise healthy man — whose partner is expecting a baby — experiences pregnancy-related symptoms. While some research suggests that Couvade syndrome (sympathetic pregnancy) is common, it isn't a recognized mental illness or disease. Further studies are needed to determine whether Couvade syndrome is a physical condition with psychological causes. 

Symptoms reported to be associated with Couvade syndrome vary widely and typically occur only during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Physical symptoms may include nausea, heartburn, abdominal pain, bloating, appetite changes, respiratory problems, toothaches, leg cramps, backaches, and urinary or genital irritations. Psychological symptoms that may be related to Couvade syndrome include changes in sleeping patterns, anxiety, depression, reduced libido and restlessness. 

Whether Couvade syndrome is real or not, what's certain is that becoming a new dad can be exciting, emotional and stressful. If you're a man whose partner is pregnant, take steps to manage stress and prepare for fatherhood. Attend prenatal classes. Seek out advice and encouragement from friends and family. Talk to your partner. Understanding and planning for the challenges ahead can help ease your transition into fatherhood.

		My 3-year-old granddaughter has coxsackievirus. It's going around her child care. Is this a serious illness?
	","
Most coxsackievirus infections aren't serious. They typically cause only mild signs and symptoms, such as: 

Coxsackievirus — sometimes written as two words, Coxsackie virus — belongs to a group of viruses called enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus infections occur most often in young children, usually during summer and fall. 

There's no specific treatment for coxsackievirus infections. Antibiotics aren't effective in treating coxsackievirus or any other viral infection. Doctors usually recommend rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers or fever reducers when appropriate. 

If your granddaughter develops more-serious signs or symptoms of coxsackievirus infection, such as severe headaches, joint pain or a high fever, she should be evaluated by a doctor. Coxsackievirus infection can lead to meningitis, but most cases are uncomplicated and resolve within a week or so. However, in rare cases, a child infected with coxsackievirus can develop a severe illness that may require hospitalization.

What can you tell me about craniosynostosis? Is surgery always necessary?,"Craniosynostosis, also called synostosis, is the premature fusing of two or more of the bony plates that form an infant's skull. Normally, these bony plates grow together during the first few years of life. But sometimes they fuse together before brain growth is complete. This can result in a misshapen skull and can also interfere with normal brain growth and development. The shape of the skull deformity and its specific name depends on which bony plates are involved.Treatment of craniosynostosis typically requires surgery during infancy to separate the fused bones. This allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop.The cause of craniosynostosis isn't known. In some cases, it's inherited. It may also be associated with a serious underlying brain abnormality, which prevents the brain from growing properly. A doctor can confirm a diagnosis of craniosynostosis by X-rays of the skull or a computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head. Additional tests may help evaluate brain development."

		Is constantly craving and chewing ice a sign of anemia?
	","
Possibly. Doctors use the term ""pica"" to describe craving and chewing substances that have no nutritional value — such as ice, clay, cornstarch or paper. Short-lived pica is very common in otherwise-healthy children. On the other hand, craving and chewing ice (pagophagia) is often associated with iron deficiency anemia. 

Less commonly, other nutritional problems may cause you to crave and chew ice. And in some individuals, pica is a sign of emotional problems, such as stress, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a developmental disorder. 

A thorough medical evaluation can help determine if pica is due to an underlying medical condition. If the cause of pica is an emotional or developmental issue, cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful.

I've heard that the cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor is dangerous for Asian-Americans. Is this true?,"In March 2005, a warning was added to the label of Crestor about the increased risk of serious muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis) in Asian-Americans. The new label also recommends a reduced starter dose — 5 milligrams a day — for Asian-Americans.Rosuvastatin (Crestor) belongs to a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins. As with all statins, some individuals who take Crestor will experience muscle side effects — most often mild muscle aches but rarely severe muscle damage. However, one clinical trial found that Asian-Americans taking Crestor had higher concentrations of the drug in their blood than did Caucasians taking the same dose. This increases the risk of muscle damage.If you currently take Crestor and have concerns about potential side effects, consult your doctor. Also, if you take any statin medication and have new muscle aching or tenderness, see your doctor promptly."
Are Crocs shoes as effective in relieving lower back pain as many people claim?,"Perhaps. Anecdotally, some people have reported that Crocs — the popular, clog-like shoes — reduce back pain. But no scientific studies support the use of one brand or style of footwear over another in relieving chronic lower back pain.If you have lower back pain, your doctor may recommend heel inserts to reduce stress in your lower back and absorb shock through your spine. It's possible that Crocs shoes — and other soft, comfortable shoes like them — may provide the same benefits.If you have lower back pain, you can try Crocs shoes to see if they help. But heel inserts may be a simpler and much cheaper first step before investing in new footwear. When buying footwear, avoid shoes with heels taller than 1 inch (2.5 centimeter), which can exacerbate back pain."
My 8-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. What are the long-term effects of this disease on her growth? Can treatment reverse these effects? ,"Active Crohn's disease can stunt the growth of a child. Also, some medications used to treat Crohn's disease in children — such as corticosteroids — can retard growth. The key is to treat the Crohn's disease and get it into remission to minimize the use of corticosteroids. Also, other medications that don't affect growth can be used in place of corticosteroids.Growth delays can become permanent if a child's growth plates have fused, which means the child has stopped growing. This usually occurs in adolescence. If the child's growth plates haven't fused yet and the Crohn's is treated, growth delays may be reversed.Good nutrition also is very important for growth. The use of other treatments to promote growth, such as growth hormone, should be discussed with your child's doctor."

		Is fatigue a common Crohn's disease symptom? What can be done about it?
	","
Crohn's disease is a condition in which the lining of the digestive tract becomes inflamed, causing severe diarrhea and abdominal pain. Fatigue is a fairly common Crohn's disease symptom. Treatment of fatigue depends on the underlying cause. 

The most likely causes of Crohn's-related fatigue include: 

To fight fatigue, it's also helpful to include physical activity in your daily routine, eat healthy foods and get adequate sleep. Be sure to share your concerns about fatigue with your doctor. He or she can search for an underlying cause and adjust your treatment plan as needed. 
"
What role does diet play in the management of Crohn's disease in children?,"Good nutrition is essential in the management of any disease — but especially in Crohn's disease treatment. Because Crohn's can cause diarrhea, decreased appetite and reduced ability to absorb nutrients, children may not get the nutrition they need to grow and develop properly.No single diet has been proved effective in treating Crohn's disease. The most important thing is to make sure your child's diet provides adequate calories and nutrients. Highly restrictive diets are generally not recommended for children with Crohn's disease. Also, eliminating too many favorite foods may make your child less enthusiastic about eating.In reality, few children with Crohn's disease require significant changes in their diets. However, because every child is different, dietary modifications can sometimes be helpful, especially during a flare.Here are a few dietary considerations for children with Crohn's:If your child has trouble eating, your doctor may recommend high-calorie, nutritionally complete liquid supplements. These can be used alone or together with regular food to increase your child's calorie intake. Another option for providing extra calories is the use of continuous liquid diet infusion at night. While your child is asleep, the formula is pumped through the nose into the stomach.If you have concerns about your child's diet or weight, ask your doctor to refer you to a registered dietitian. A registered dietitian can help you plan nutritionally balanced meals with adequate calories to meet the specific dietary needs of your child."
What is an appropriate diet for a person with Crohn's disease?,"Crohn's disease is an inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the digestive tract, but it most often affects the lower end of the small intestine and the large intestine (colon). Symptoms include watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and sometimes rectal bleeding. Although there's no evidence that diet causes Crohn's disease, certain foods and beverages may aggravate its symptoms.Dietary guidelines for Crohn's disease vary depending on the severity of the disease, location of the inflammation, and symptoms. Poor nutrition can be a consequence of poorly controlled Crohn's disease. Poor nutrition may also make it more difficult to recover from flares of the disease.General dietary guidelines for Crohn's disease include:In rare cases of severe Crohn's disease, tube feedings (enteral nutrition) or intravenous nutrition (parenteral nutrition) may be necessary. Your doctor may also recommend a liquid diet for a short period."

		Does breathing warm mist work as an at-home remedy for croup symptoms?
	","
Warm, humid air has long been considered a useful croup treatment if symptoms aren't severe. But there's little scientific evidence showing measurable benefits from using steam as a croup treatment. Still, exposing your child to a warm, moist environment as a croup treatment isn't likely to be harmful and may be worth a try. 

The primary sign of croup — medically known as viral laryngotracheobronchitis — is a distinctive barking cough caused by inflammation around the vocal cords. Other signs and symptoms include fever and a hoarse voice. 

For mild croup, use a cool-air humidifier in your child's bedroom or have your child breathe the warm, moist air in a steamy bathroom. Weather permitting, you may also wrap your child in a coat or blanket and stand in the cool night air. For severe croup — such as a barking cough accompanied by noisy, labored inspirations of breathing (stridor) — a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, epinephrine or another medication to open your child's airways.

		I read that to prevent heart attacks more people should be taking cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) if they have high C-reactive protein levels. Should more people be taking statins, and what's C-reactive protein?
	","
It's too soon to say whether more people should take statins. These cholesterol-lowering drugs are a safe and effective treatment for lowering cholesterol. But as with any drug, you shouldn't take them unless there's a good reason to. While statins are safe, they can cause side effects such as muscle pain in some people. 

There's been an ongoing debate in the medical community about whether more people should take statins. One recent study known as the Jupiter study, released in November 2008, found that taking a statin known as rosuvastatin (Crestor) lowered the risk of death, heart attacks and other problems in some people with high C-reactive protein levels. 

What was unique about this study was that no one in the study had traditional risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels or high blood pressure. But everyone in the study did have high levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP indicates that something in your body is inflamed. Damaged or inflamed blood vessels are associated with high levels of CRP. The theory is that these high levels of CRP might be an early warning sign of heart disease — a sign that shows up before your cholesterol rises. 

Despite these promising results, it's not clear yet whether everyone with high CRP levels should start taking statins or who should be tested for increased CRP levels. Researchers and health organizations will examine the Jupiter results and may issue new prevention guidelines. Until then, the old advice still applies: Eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise, keep your cholesterol levels low, and talk to your doctor about whether statin medications are right for you.

		Are CT scans safe? Is it true that CT scans may increase my risk of cancer?
	","
Medical imaging exams — including CT scans — have been directly linked to greater life expectancy and declining cancer death rates. Medical imaging exams are also generally less expensive and safer than the invasive procedures that they replace. CT scans, like other X-ray-imaging exams, involve a brief, targeted exposure to a small amount of ionizing radiation. This radiation is used to create an image of your body's internal structures. Although CT scans expose you to more radiation than traditional X-ray exams do, they also provide much more detailed images, which allows your doctor to detect and precisely locate many medical conditions. 

CT scans may slightly increase your risk of developing cancer, although at the low doses used with CT, the risk is very small — so small that it's difficult to prove that any risk actually exists. Because of the possible risk, the American College of Radiology advises that no imaging exam be done unless there is a clear medical benefit that outweighs any associated risk. 

When your doctor believes that a CT scan will help answer an important medical question, the potential benefits to your health can greatly outweigh any small potential risk from radiation.

		Is there any evidence that cupping therapy relieves fibromyalgia pain?
	","
Some studies indicate that cupping, when combined with acupuncture, may reduce fibromyalgia symptoms more effectively than conventional medications such as amitriptyline. Cupping therapy is typically practiced by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. The theory behind cupping is that it moves or stimulates your body's natural energy — also called qi.

Cupping therapy involves heating the air inside a glass cup, which removes some of the air from the cup. The cup is then quickly placed on the skin, and the resulting vacuum pulls the skin part of the way into the cup. The cup may be left in place for several minutes and then removed, leaving behind a bright red, circular welt. In wet cupping, the skin is pricked with a needle before the cup is placed.

Studies of cupping typically measure the procedure's effectiveness by comparing it to that of other forms of treatment. However, high-quality research studies usually also include a group of people who receive a placebo — a sugar pill or a fake version of the procedure being studied. Because a sham version of cupping hasn't been devised, this level of quality is not yet available for cupping studies. So while some of the available studies do suggest a possible role for cupping in treating fibromyalgia, the definitive answer as to what its role actually is will have to wait for larger and more rigorous studies to be completed.

At this time, there isn't enough evidence to recommend curcumin for preventing or treating cancer, but research is ongoing. 

Curcumin, a substance found in the spice turmeric, has long been used in Asian medicine to treat a variety of maladies. Now some research suggests that curcumin may help prevent or treat cancer. 

Curcumin is thought to have antioxidant properties, which means it may decrease swelling and inflammation. It's being explored as a cancer treatment in part because inflammation appears to play a role in cancer. 

Laboratory and animal research suggests that curcumin may prevent cancer, slow the spread of cancer, make chemotherapy more effective and protect healthy cells from damage by radiation therapy. Curcumin is being studied for use in many types of cancer. 

Studies of curcumin in people are still in the early stages. Clinical trials are under way to investigate curcumin as a way to prevent cancer in people with precancerous conditions, as a cancer treatment, and as a remedy for signs and symptoms caused by cancer treatments. 

Research is ongoing, and there isn't enough evidence to recommend curcumin at this time. As always, talk with your doctor before using any herbal supplement.

I am four months pregnant and have just been diagnosed with cytomegalovirus. Can it be treated? What is the risk to my fetus?,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection related to herpes. It typically causes no signs or symptoms in healthy children and adults — although some may experience a mononucleosis-like illness — and doesn't require treatment. But cytomegalovirus is of concern in pregnancy because the mother can pass the virus to her fetus, which increases the risk of birth defects.Cytomegalovirus is the most common congenital (present at birth) infection. Most babies who are infected with cytomegalovirus before birth will show no signs or symptoms of CMV at birth. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 15 percent will develop neurological abnormalities, such as deafness, blindness or mental retardation.A doctor can confirm a CMV infection in a pregnant woman by a blood test. If a pregnant woman has cytomegalovirus, a doctor can test the fetus for infection by amniocentesis. Ultrasound may detect abnormalities in the fetus.Cytomegalovirus is treated with antiviral medications. But these drugs aren't proved to be safe in pregnancy. Also, there is no evidence that they protect the fetus. If you have cytomegalovirus, your doctor will want to closely monitor your pregnancy.

When your nose is congested, veins that usually drain from your eyes into your nose become widened (dilated) and darker.Another cause of undereye circles is eyelid swelling during sleep. When you lie down, gravity can cause fluid to collect in your lower eyelids. This swelling may create the appearance of shadows below your eyes. In addition, dark circles can result from chronic skin conditions, such as atopic eczema. Dark circles can also run in families.Over-the-counter products may help diminish dark circles under eyes.

I'd like to try deep-frying our turkey this year. Is this safe?,"Deep-fried turkey is safe as long as the turkey is cooked to the appropriate internal temperature and the frying is done outdoors.Deep-frying has become a popular method for cooking a whole turkey. When done properly, deep-fried turkey can be incredibly delicious — crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. But keep in mind that deep-frying adds fat and calories. Also, deep-fried turkeys are often injected with a marinade, which can be high in sodium.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), deep-frying works best if the turkey is 12 pounds or less. Larger turkeys are more difficult to handle, which increases safety concerns when cooking with hot oil. Also, large turkeys take longer to cook. As a result, you may end up with a bird that is charred on the outside but still undercooked in the inside.When deep-frying a turkey, choose a cooking pot that is large enough to accommodate the turkey and oil without the oil spilling over. To determine how much oil you'll need, place the turkey in the cooking pot and add water to cover. Then, remove the turkey and measure the amount of water in the pot. This is the amount of oil needed.The turkey may be cooked plain or it may be breaded, coated with a dry rub or injected with a marinade. The turkey should not be stuffed.To safely deep-fry a turkey, the USDA offers these tips:Allow the used oil to cool before pouring it into containers for refrigerator storage.

		My doctor says I have ""degenerative changes"" in my spine. Does this mean I have arthritis?
	","
Yes. The phrase ""degenerative changes"" in the spine refers to osteoarthritis of the spine. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Doctors may also refer to it as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease. Osteoarthritis in the spine most commonly occurs in the neck and lower back. 

In osteoarthritis of the spine, the spaces between the vertebrae narrow. Bone spurs often form. When bone surfaces rub together, the vertebral joints (facets) and areas around the cartilage become inflamed and painful. Gradually, your spine stiffens and loses flexibility. Once these changes appear on X-rays, osteoarthritis has already started. 

If you have osteoarthritis, your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment and pain management plan, which may include exercise, medications and measures to protect your joints. Your doctor may also refer you to a rheumatologist, physical therapist or orthopedic surgeon.

What causes muscle soreness the day after a hard workout? Can I continue exercising when I have this soreness?,"Delayed-onset muscle soreness usually occurs 24 to 36 hours after a workout. The exact cause of muscle soreness isn't clear. It may be due to the build up of energy waste products in the muscle. It may also be due to microscopic tears in muscle fibers.If your discomfort is mild, you can continue your exercise program.

		What is the cause of demyelinating disease and what can you do about it?
	","
A demyelinating disease is any condition that results in damage to the protective covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in your brain and spinal cord. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve impulses slow or even stop, causing neurological problems.

<strong>Multiple sclerosis<br/>
</strong>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease. In this disorder, your immune system attacks the myelin sheath or the cells that produce and maintain it. This causes inflammation and injury to the sheath and ultimately to the nerve fibers that it surrounds, and may result in multiple areas of scarring (sclerosis). 

<strong>Other causes<br/>
</strong>Other types of demyelinating disease and their causes include: 

MS and other demyelinating diseases may result in vision or hearing loss, headache, seizures, muscle spasms and weakness, loss of coordination, paralysis, and loss of sensation. 

<strong>Treatment<br/>
</strong>No cures exist for demyelinating diseases and their progression, and symptoms are different for everyone. Getting treatment early is important. Treatment focuses on: 

A variety of drug therapies are recommended depending on your specific disorder. These may include medications that decrease the frequency of new lesion formation. Strategies to treat symptoms include physical therapy, muscle relaxing drugs, and medications to reduce pain and fatigue. Talk with your doctor about the best course of treatment for your specific disorder.

		I think my child might need dental braces to straighten her teeth. What's the right age to begin treatment with dental braces?
	","
It's a good idea to get an orthodontic evaluation by the time a child is 7 years old. An orthodontist is a dentist with additional training, who specializes in aligning and straightening teeth. The best time for your child to get dental braces depends on the severity and the cause of the misalignment of your child's teeth.

Traditionally, treatment with dental braces begins when a child has lost most of his or her baby (primary) teeth, and a majority of his or her adult (permanent) teeth have grown in — usually between the ages of 8 and 14.

Some orthodontists recommend an approach that involves the use of a dental appliance — not always dental braces — at an earlier age, while a child still has most of his or her baby teeth. This may especially be appealing to children who are stressed or embarrassed by crooked teeth or bite issues. Then, when a child has most of his or her adult teeth, a second phase of treatment is started — usually with dental braces. This second phase is thought by some to be shorter than a traditional course of braces if an early treatment has been performed.

Orthodontists who favor the traditional approach say that a two-phase approach to treatment actually increases the total time — and sometimes the expense — of orthodontic treatment with generally similar results.

The best choice for you and your child will largely depend on the severity of your child's dental problems. Talk with your child's dentist or orthodontist about what's the best course of action.

		My dentist recommended replacing my metal dental fillings with a composite material, which would be quite expensive. Is this necessary?
	","
That depends on the reason for your dentist's recommendation. 

If your metal dental fillings are defective or show decay, it's important to replace them. Untreated decay may eventually lead to an infection (abscess). In some cases, replacing metal dental fillings may benefit the long-term health of the tooth. 

Generally, replacing metal dental fillings for aesthetic reasons should only be done after careful consideration and if your dentist feels it will not compromise the long-term health of the tooth. Likewise, there's no need to replace metal dental fillings because of concerns about mercury in the fillings. 

Most metal dental fillings are dental amalgam — a stable alloy made with mercury, silver, tin, copper and possibly other metals. Although concerns have been raised over the years about the safety of mercury in dental amalgam, researchers have proved the concerns to be unfounded. The American Dental Association supports the use of dental amalgam as a safe, reliable and effective treatment for dental decay. 

If you're unsure whether you need to replace your metal dental fillings, ask your dentist to explain the options and help you understand what's best in your case.

		Is it more effective to floss teeth with a water pick or standard dental floss?
	","
Standard dental floss is generally considered the most effective tool for cleaning the tight spaces between the teeth. You can also use dental floss to scrape up and down the sides of each tooth. 

A water pick (oral irrigator) is a device that aims a stream of water at your teeth. A water pick can help remove food particles from your teeth and might help reduce bleeding and gum disease — but it isn't generally considered a substitute for brushing and flossing. 

If plain dental floss gets stuck in your teeth, use the waxed variety. If you have a hard time handling dental floss, try a floss holder. Other options might include special brushes, picks or sticks designed to clean between the teeth.

		Is it possible to have depression and anxiety at the same time?
	","
Depression and anxiety are different conditions, but they commonly occur together. They also have similar treatments. 

Feeling down or having the blues now and then is normal. And, everyone feels anxious from time to time — it's a normal response to stressful situations. But, severe or ongoing feelings of anxiety and depression can be a sign of an underlying mental health disorder.

Anxiety may occur as a symptom of clinical (major) depression. It's also common to have depression that's triggered by an anxiety disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Many people have a diagnosis of both an anxiety disorder and clinical depression.

Symptoms of both conditions usually improve with psychological counseling (psychotherapy), medications such as antidepressants, or a combination of the two. Lifestyle changes such as improving sleep habits, using stress-reduction techniques or getting regular exercise may also help. If you have either condition, avoid alcohol and illegal drugs. They can make both conditions worse.

		What's the most effective depression treatment for children?
	","
For children, depression treatment may include psychotherapy either alone or in combination with antidepressant medication. Although opinions vary about which depression treatment should be tried first, a growing body of evidence indicates that the best approach for most children is a combination of both. Treatment is most often provided in an outpatient setting. Sometimes hospital care may be needed. The treatment plan must be tailored to the severity of the child's symptoms and how they affect his or her development. 

Many types of psychotherapy are available. For depression treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy may be especially effective. Children who are depressed often have an unhealthy, negative view of themselves and their experiences. With cognitive behavioral therapy, children learn to develop a healthier, more positive outlook — which can help relieve depression. Sometimes it's helpful for families to be involved in therapy as well. 

Antidepressant medication is another option for childhood depression treatment, especially when psychotherapy is unable to effectively treat mood symptoms. Untreated mood disorders in adolescents are associated with an increased risk of suicide. Some research also indicates a link between antidepressants and increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children being treated with these drugs, so it's important for doctors to carefully weigh the risks and benefits before prescribing antidepressants to children. Still, for many kids, the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the risks. 

Antidepressants may be particularly helpful for children who: 

Even when symptoms of depression go away, continuing psychotherapy or antidepressants for a time reduces the risk that depression will recur. 

Remember, depression is as common in children as it is in adults. Early detection and treatment of depression is important at any age — and family support is essential. If you suspect that your child is depressed, contact your child's doctor or a mental health provider.

		Do detox diets offer any health benefits?
	","
Detox, or detoxification, diets are popular, but they're not scientifically proven. 

Detox diets are touted as a way to remove toxins from the body. Specific detox diets vary — but typically a period of fasting is followed by a strict diet of raw vegetables, fruit and fruit juices, and water. In addition, some detox diets advocate using herbs and other supplements along with colon cleansing (enemas) to empty the intestines.

Some people report feeling more focused and energetic during and after detox diets. However, there's little evidence that detox diets actually remove toxins from the body. Indeed, the kidneys and liver effectively filter and eliminate most ingested toxins. The benefits from a detox diet may actually come from avoiding highly processed foods that have solid fats and added sugar.

If you're considering a detox diet, get the OK from your doctor first. It's also important to consider possible side effects. Detox diets that severely limit protein or that require fasting, for example, can result in fatigue. Long-term fasting can result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Colon cleansing, which is often recommended as part of a detox plan, can cause cramping, bloating, nausea and vomiting. Dehydration also can be a concern. 

Finally, keep in mind that fad diets aren't a good long-term solution. For lasting results, your best bet is to eat a healthy diet based on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean sources of protein.

		Do detox foot pads really work?
	","
No scientific studies have been published showing that detox foot pads do what they claim they'll do. 

Manufacturers of detox foot pads say that the products draw toxins out of your body while you sleep. Some manufacturers have claimed that detox foot pads also reduce blood pressure, treat depression and aid weight loss. Typically, you're instructed to stick a detox foot pad on the bottom of one of your feet overnight for 30 days in a row for an initial cleansing period. When you peel off the detox foot pad in the morning, its darkened or discolored appearance supposedly reflects the toxins that have been removed from your body. 

Detox foot pads are said to contain natural ingredients — such as a mix of wood vinegar, plants and herbs, and the mineral tourmaline. The ingredients in detox foot pads are said to react with your body and give off infrared energy, improving cell function and drawing out toxins, such as lead and arsenic. Similar products include detox foot baths and spas. 

However, no scientific studies have been published that show that detox foot pads work or that they're safe. The Federal Trade Commission has charged some distributors of detox foot pads with deceptive advertising. The bottom line: As with anything that sounds too good to be true, wait for scientific evidence that proves the claim before investing your time and money.

		I've heard that you shouldn't eat sweet fruits such as chikoo or mangoes if you have diabetes. Is this true?

It is a common myth that if you have diabetes you shouldn't eat certain foods because they are ""too sweet."" Some fruits do contain more sugar than others, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't eat them if you have diabetes. The total amount of carbohydrates affects blood sugar levels more than does the source of carbohydrates or whether the source is a starch or sugar. 

One serving of fruit should contain 15 grams of carbohydrates. The size of the serving depends on the carbohydrate content of the fruit. The advantage of eating a low-carbohydrate fruit is that you can consume a larger portion.

Generally, there's no advantage to substituting honey for sugar in a diabetes eating plan. Both honey and sugar will affect your blood sugar level. 

Honey is sweeter than granulated sugar, so you might use a smaller amount of honey for sugar in some recipes. But honey actually has slightly more carbohydrates and more calories per teaspoon than does granulated sugar — so any calories and carbohydrates you save will be minimal. 

If you prefer the taste of honey, go ahead and use it — but only in moderation. Be sure to count the carbohydrates in honey as part of your diabetes eating plan.

		I've heard that aspirin therapy may not help prevent heart problems when you have diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Should I keep taking it?
	","
If you have diabetes, you're at higher risk of heart attack and clot-related stroke (cardiovascular events). Perhipheral artery disease — a condition in which your arteries narrow, reducing blood flow to your arms and legs — also increases your risk of cardiovascular events. 

Aspirin interferes with your blood's ability to clot. Because you're at increased risk of cardiovascular events if you have diabetes, daily aspirin therapy typically has been recommended as part of a diabetes management plan. Research has shown that aspirin therapy is effective at reducing the risk of heart attack and clot-related strokes if you've had a previous cardiovascular event. It also appears to reduce these risks if you're experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease — such as leg cramping, numbness or weakness. 

What's not clear is whether aspirin lowers the risk of a cardiovascular event if you haven't experienced one before and you aren't experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease. More study is needed on the potential benefits and risks of aspirin therapy in these people. Aspirin therapy does have potential side effects, such as bleeding and bleeding stroke (hemorrhagic stroke). If you have diabetes, peripheral artery disease or both, ask your doctor about daily aspirin therapy, including which strength of aspirin would be best.

Whether cinnamon can lower blood sugar is a topic of debate — but recent research suggests that cinnamon may be helpful as a supplement to regular diabetes treatment in people with type 2 diabetes. 

One study published in 2009 found that cinnamon taken twice a day for 90 days improved hemoglobin A1C levels — a reflection of average blood sugar level for the past two to three months — in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1C levels greater than 7 percent). 

More research is needed to confirm these findings and determine how cinnamon supplementation leads to these benefits. One theory is that cinnamon increases insulin action. 

If you have diabetes, remember that treatment is a lifelong commitment of blood sugar monitoring, healthy eating, regular exercise and, sometimes, diabetes medications or insulin therapy. Consult your doctor if you have questions or concerns about your diabetes treatment plan.

		Why are electric blankets discouraged for people who have diabetes? What's the danger?
	","
Diabetes has many possible complications, including nerve damage (neuropathy). Over time, excess blood sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves. This can cause tingling or numbness that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and over a period of months or years gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, it's possible to lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. If a person has any degree of nerve damage, he or she may not be able to sense if an electric blanket or heating pad is too hot — which can lead to inadvertent burns. The same issue applies to water temperature when bathing. 

If you have diabetes and would like to use an electric blanket, warm up your bed with the blanket before bedtime — then turn the blanket off or remove it from the bed before you climb in.

Yes, alcohol and tobacco use increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Although studies show that drinking moderate amounts of alcohol (one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men) may actually lower the risk of diabetes, the opposite is true for people who drink greater amounts of alcohol.

<strong>Heavy alcohol use</strong><br/>
Too much alcohol can cause chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can impair its ability to secrete insulin and ultimately lead to diabetes.

<strong>Tobacco use</strong><br/>
Tobacco is equally harmful. Tobacco use can increase blood sugar levels and lead to insulin resistance. And the more you smoke, the greater your risk of diabetes.

Heavy smokers — those who smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day — almost double their risk of developing diabetes, when compared with nonsmokers.

You're wise to wonder about steps to protect your liver. Diabetes raises your risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition in which excess fat builds up in your liver even if you drink little or no alcohol. This condition occurs in at least half of those with type 2 diabetes and close to half of those with type 1. Other medical conditions related to diabetes — including obesity, high cholesterol and high blood pressure — also raise your risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. 

Fatty liver disease itself often causes no symptoms. But it raises your risk of developing liver inflammation or scarring (cirrhosis). It's also linked to an increased risk of liver cancer and heart disease.

		Why do abdominal muscles sometimes separate during pregnancy?
	","
During pregnancy, the growing uterus stretches the muscles in the abdomen. This can cause a condition called diastasis recti or diastasis recti abdominis, in which the two large parallel bands of muscles that meet in the middle of the abdomen separate. Diastasis recti might cause a bulge in the middle of the abdomen where the two muscles separate. The condition might be noticeable only when the abdominal muscles are tense. 

Diastasis recti is most likely in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The muscle separation often lessens in the months after childbirth. However, some degree of separation might remain up to a year after childbirth and beyond. Diastasis recti can weaken the abdominal muscles, causing lower back pain and making it difficult to lift objects or do other routine daily activities. 

You might be more likely to develop diastasis recti as a result of pregnancy if you: 

During pregnancy, aggressive abdominal exercises after the first trimester also might contribute to the development of diastasis recti. 

If you think you have diastasis recti, consult your health care provider. After childbirth, certain exercises can help you regain abdominal strength. A physical therapist can help determine which exercises would be right for you. If abdominal muscle weakness associated with diastasis recti is interfering with your daily activities, surgery might be recommended to repair the muscle separation. If you're bothered by the bulge in your abdomen, you might also consider surgery for cosmetic reasons.

	","
When you're dieting, it's important to be mindful of what and how much you're drinking. Although milk and juice have many important nutrients and can be part of a healthy diet, they still have calories — and calories in liquid form count just as much as calories in food. 

So when you're counting calories, the best beverage choice is water. Keep higher calorie beverages in check. As a general rule, adults should drink no more than 4 ounces (118 milliliters) of juice a day and 16 to 24 ounces (473 to 710 milliliters) of milk a day.

If water isn't filling enough when you're dieting, snack on fresh fruit and vegetables between meals. Whole fruits and vegetables are much more filling than juice — and it's likely you'll consume fewer calories with these choices.

		How long does it take to digest food — from the time you eat it to the time you excrete it?
	","
Digestion time varies between individuals and between men and women. After you eat, it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine. Food then enters your large intestine (colon) for further digestion, absorption of water and, finally, elimination of undigested food. 

In the 1980s, Mayo Clinic researchers measured digestion time in 21 healthy people. Total transit time, from eating to elimination in stool, averaged 53 hours (although that figure is a little overstated, because the markers used by the researchers passed more slowly through the stomach than actual food). The average transit time through just the large intestine (colon) was 40 hours, with significant difference between men and women: 33 hours for men, 47 hours for women. 

Two British doctors studied digestion time in children. They fed 35 children juice containing a red marker and asked the children's mothers to note when the stool first turned red. The mean time of transit from mouth to anus for the group was 33 hours (meaning half the children had digestion times slower than this and half had digestion times greater than this).

Suction dilation and curettage is often used when an incomplete miscarriage has occurred, and some fetal or placental tissue remains inside the uterus.Not everyone who has a miscarriage needs suction dilation and curettage.

		My 8-month-old son is getting his first baby teeth, and they seem discolored. Should I be worried?
	","
Baby teeth, also called primary teeth, are typically off-white or ivory. Baby teeth can become discolored for many reasons, including: 

If the discoloration is caused by poor dental hygiene, more thorough brushing — using water and a small, soft-bristled toothbrush or the fingertip variety designed for infants — may help. There's no need to use toothpaste until your son learns to spit, usually about age 2 or 3. 

In addition, remember that sipping milk or juice throughout the day or while falling asleep contributes to tooth decay. Don't let your son carry a bottle or sippy cup during the day and don't put him to bed with a bottle, unless it contains only a small amount of plain water. Also, don't share eating utensils with your son. This can spread cavity-causing bacteria. If your son uses a pacifier, don't clean it in your mouth — and never dip a pacifier in honey or other sugary coatings. 

Discuss your concerns about your son's baby teeth with his doctor. He or she might refer you to a pediatric dentist. After addressing any underlying issues, the dentist might recommend bleaching the discolored teeth or simply watching the teeth for signs of other problems.

Semen color and consistency can vary based on several factors, such as age, diet and frequency of ejaculation. However, yellowish-green semen may indicate a prostate infection. Semen is normally a whitish, cloudy fluid. It's usually quite thick just after ejaculation, but liquefies about 20 to 30 minutes later. 

Changes in the appearance of semen are usually temporary and not a health concern. However, sometimes these changes can be a sign of an underlying medical condition that requires further evaluation.

Very few people who have low back pain require surgery of any kind to obtain relief from their discomfort. But if conservative treatments haven't resolved your pain within six months and your doctor has determined that your disk joint is the source of your chronic pain, you might be a candidate for disk replacement surgery.

Spinal fusion — the most common type of back surgery for painful joints — involves fusing two or more vertebrae together. Disk replacement surgery is a newer procedure that replaces the problem disk joint with an artificial one made of metal and plastic.

In general, it appears that spinal fusion and disk replacement procedures are equally effective. But in some cases, intensive rehabilitation programs appear to work just as well as either type of surgery — at a lower cost and with fewer complications.

		Can diuretics decrease your potassium level?
	","
Many diuretics (sometimes called water pills) decrease potassium in the blood. Diuretics lower blood pressure by helping your body eliminate sodium and water through your urine, which reduces blood volume and decreases pressure on your artery walls. However, some diuretics can also cause you to eliminate more potassium in your urine. This can lead to low potassium levels in your blood (hypokalemia). Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia include: 

There are potassium-sparing diuretics that don't cause this problem. These include spironolactone (Aldactone), eplerenone (Inspra) and triamterene (Dyrenium). 

Other medications besides diuretics can help reduce your blood pressure: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. These medications usually increase potassium levels in your blood, too. 

If you're taking an ACE inhibitor with a diuretic and getting enough potassium in your diet but your potassium level is still low, your doctor may recommend further testing to help identify the underlying cause. Rarely, low potassium may be due to overproduction of the hormone aldosterone (hyperaldosteronism), which increases potassium loss by the kidneys. 

Treatment of low potassium may include:

		I want to follow a diverticulitis diet to prevent diverticulitis attacks. What foods are most likely to trigger a diverticulitis attack?
	","
Actually, no specific foods are known to trigger a diverticulitis attack. And there's no diverticulitis diet that's been proven to prevent attacks.

Still, following a so-called diverticulitis diet remains a popular, if unproven, way to try to prevent or treat diverticulitis attacks. Nuts, seeds and popcorn were once discouraged under a diverticulitis diet because they were said to trigger diverticulitis attacks. But research shows that seeds and popcorn don't increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding, so it's OK to eat them even if you have diverticulosis.

If you're trying to prevent diverticulitis attacks, focus less on a so-called diverticulitis diet and more on an overall healthy diet that's high in fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, soften waste and help it pass more quickly through your colon. This reduces pressure within your digestive tract, which can reduce the risk of diverticulitis attacks.

If you think that you're having a diverticulitis attack, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will likely prescribe treatment and suggest that you follow a clear-liquid diet for two or three days, and then gradually add in low-fiber foods. This kind of diverticulitis diet helps your digestive tract rest and heal during treatment.

In fact, eating a high-fiber diet — which may include nuts and seeds — may reduce the risk of diverticular disease.

However, if you have diverticulitis and you believe that nuts and seeds trigger your attacks, avoid these foods. Just make sure you get enough fiber from other dietary sources.

The appeal of saunas in general is that they cause reactions, such as vigorous sweating and increased heart rate, similar to those elicited by moderate exercise. An infrared sauna produces these results at lower temperatures than does a regular sauna, which makes it accessible to people who can't tolerate the heat of a conventional sauna. But does that translate into tangible health benefits? Perhaps.

Several studies have looked at using infrared saunas in the treatment of chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and rheumatoid arthritis, and found some evidence of benefit. However, larger and more-rigorous studies are needed to confirm these results.

On the other hand, no adverse effects have been reported with infrared saunas. So if you're considering trying a sauna for relaxation, an infrared sauna might be an option.

		Is vitamin C good for more than fighting colds? Can it improve your mood?
	","
Vitamin C has several benefits, including a modest effect combating the common cold. Recent research suggests another potential use for vitamin C. In a study of hospitalized patients — who often have lower than normal vitamin C levels — researchers observed an improvement in mood after they received vitamin C.

The link between vitamin C and mood may seem surprising, but it's not so far-fetched. People who have vitamin C deficiency often feel fatigued or depressed. Plus, some studies show that vitamin C can have mood-elevating effects. So it makes sense that vitamin C levels could affect mood — but more research is needed.

In the meantime, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C. If you also take a supplement, try not to exceed the upper limit of 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day. As always, talk to your doctor first before taking any supplement.

		I've seen commercials for several brands of toning shoes. Can these types of shoes make my legs more toned?
	","
Despite the claims, there is no convincing evidence that wearing toning shoes will make your legs more toned or cause you to burn extra calories. 

Toning shoes are designed to simulate walking barefoot or walking on an uneven surface. Manufacturers say the unstable design of the shoes forces wearers to use their leg muscles more — which burns more calories and tones the muscles. However, an independent study by a nonprofit fitness organization found no evidence that wearing toning shoes leads to improved muscle tone or greater energy expenditure. In addition, there are no studies that prove that they improve balance or stability to a great degree. 

If you like the way toning shoes look and find them comfortable and not too unstable, there's probably no harm in trying a pair. And if you increase your activity as a result, you'll benefit your overall health.

		How do weight-loss products such as Sensa, SlimScents and Aroma Patch work?
	","
These scent-based weight-loss products deliver aromas that are supposed to reduce your appetite. Sensa is sprinkled on your food. The Aroma Patch is worn on your hand, wrist or chest. SlimScents is inhaled through your nose before meals.

Alan Hirsch, M.D., who developed Sensa, says proof of its effectiveness comes from a six-month study he conducted in which participants lost an average of 15 percent of their body weight. The makers of Aroma Patch and SlimScents point to another study by Dr. Hirsh to bolster their claims. That study, which was reported in a medical journal, showed that volunteers who used an aroma inhaler lost an average of 2 percent of their body weight over six months. However, neither of these studies lasted longer than six months. So they didn't look at whether participants were able to maintain the weight loss over time. 

So can these weight-loss products lead to significant, sustainable weight loss? The jury is still out on that question. Even some of the makers of these weight-loss products acknowledge that losing weight comes down to diet and exercise. It makes more sense, then, to skip the scents and focus on what's proven to work — reducing the calories you eat and increasing the calories you burn through exercise.

		Is sunscreen from last year still good? When does sunscreen expire?
	","
Sunscreens are designed to remain stable and at original strength for up to three years. This means that you can use leftover sunscreen from one year to the next.

Some sunscreens include an expiration date, or an indication of when the sunscreen is no longer effective. Discard sunscreen that's past the expiration date, is more than three years old or has been exposed to high temperatures.

Keep in mind, however, that if you use sunscreen generously and frequently, a bottle of sunscreen shouldn't last from one year to the next. Generally, a liberal application is 1 ounce (30 milliliters) — the amount in a shot glass — to cover all exposed parts of the body. If you have a 4-ounce (118-milliliter) bottle, you'll use about one-fourth of it during one application.

To maximize protection, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. Apply sunscreen generously 20 to 30 minutes before going outdoors and reapply about every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or sweating. Be sure to rub the sunscreen in well.

Is it possible for humans to catch the dog flu from their dogs?,"There is no evidence that the dog flu virus can infect humans, according to a media briefing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in September 2005.The dog flu (canine influenza) is a growing concern among dog owners in the United States. First reported in Florida in 2004, dog flu is highly contagious among dogs. Signs and symptoms in dogs include sneezing, coughing and fever. In severe cases, it can be fatal. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine and dogs have no immunity to this new flu.Scientists believe that the virus that causes dog flu mutated from a strain of horse flu (equine influenza). The dog flu is not related to bird flu (avian influenza), which can infect humans.Although there are no documented cases of human infection with the dog flu virus, the CDC continues to monitor cases of human exposure."

		What is a Doppler ultrasound?
	","
Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive test that can be used to measure your blood flow and blood pressure by bouncing high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) off circulating red blood cells. A regular ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images, but can't show blood flow.

A Doppler ultrasound may help diagnose many conditions, including:

A Doppler ultrasound can estimate how fast blood flows by measuring the rate of change in its pitch (frequency). During a Doppler ultrasound, a technician trained in ultrasound imaging (sonographer) presses a small hand-held device (transducer), about the size of a bar of soap, against your skin over the area of your body being examined, moving from one area to another as necessary. This test may be done as an alternative to more-invasive procedures such as arteriography and venography, which involve injecting dye into the blood vessels so that they show up clearly on X-ray images.

A Doppler ultrasound test may also help your doctor check for injuries to your arteries or to monitor certain treatments to your veins and arteries.

Keep in mind that a doula doesn't provide medical advice or replace the role of your health care team. A doula, however, may add another opinion to the mix when decisions need to be made regarding the management of your labor. In addition, most insurance plans don't cover doula fees.

If you're interested in hiring a doula, ask your health care provider, childbirth instructor, family or friends for recommendations. When interviewing a potential doula, be sure to ask about his or her training, how many births he or she has attended, his or her philosophy about childbirth and what services he or she provides. Also discuss your preferences and concerns about pregnancy, labor and delivery.

I've heard about new guidelines for Down syndrome screening. What are the latest recommendations?,"A new study supports screening for Down syndrome in pregnancy weeks earlier than what has traditionally been recommended.Blood tests — such as the quad screen or the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test — have typically been offered around the 16th week of pregnancy to screen for Down syndrome, spina bifida and various other chromosomal disorders. These tests are still available. But the new study recommends other screening methods for Down syndrome earlier in pregnancy.According to the study, the most effective screening is done in two steps between the 11th and 14th week of pregnancy:When this two-step screening is done during the 11th week of pregnancy, researchers say it can identify 87 percent of babies with Down syndrome. By 13 weeks, accuracy of the two-step screening approach drops to 82 percent — about the same as traditional second-trimester blood tests.If the screening tests are positive or worrisome or the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is high, more invasive tests such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis may be used to confirm the diagnosis.About one in 20 women will have a false positive result with any of these screening tests — far more than those who have a baby with a chromosomal abnormality.The decision to screen for Down syndrome or other abnormalities is personal. For many women, earlier screening will provide welcome peace of mind about their babies' health. For others, early news can offer precious time to prepare for the challenges that may lie ahead."
"Are dried fruits, such as apricots, just as good for you as fresh fruit?","Like fresh fruit, dried fruit provides fiber, vitamin A and potassium. It also contains vitamin C and folate — although in smaller amounts than fresh fruit does. Perhaps the main drawback to dried fruits are that they contain more calories per serving than fresh fruits, because most of the water — which gives fruit its bulk — has been removed. For example, 1 cup of fresh apricot halves has 74 calories, while 1 cup of dried apricot halves has 213 calories. If you're trying to lose weight, use dried fruits sparingly. Also, try to buy dried fruits that are processed without added sugar.It's important to know that some dried fruits may be preserved with sulfite, which can trigger an allergic reaction in some people. If you're sensitive to sulfites, read the label to find out if sulfites have been used."

What is the purpose of a drug-induced coma?,"Coma is a state of prolonged unconsciousness in which the brain is functioning at its lowest level of alertness. Under certain circumstances, doctors may induce a temporary coma using a controlled dose of barbiturate drug. This is referred to as a drug-induced coma or medically induced coma.Drug-induced coma may be used to protect the brain following major brain surgery or for prolonged seizures. It may also be used to control brain swelling (intracranial hypertension) caused by a brain injury — such as due to head trauma, stroke or infection. However, such use is controversial.Drug-induced comas are used only when conventional therapy to relieve brain swelling has failed. Barbiturates reduce brain activity, which allows the brain the time it needs to heal. But this potential benefit must be weighed against potential serious complications of the treatment, such as pneumonia."
I just read about the XDR-TB scare in the news. Should I be worried that I could catch it?,"Probably not. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), like other strains of tuberculosis (TB), is rather difficult to spread.XDR-TB spreads like other forms of TB. Infected people release the bacteria that cause TB in the air by coughing, sneezing, talking, laughing or singing. The bacteria can float in the air for hours, but you need to be in close contact with an infected person for a prolonged period to risk becoming infected with TB. You are more likely to get TB from a close family member or co-worker — someone you spend a lot of time with — than from a stranger on a plane. Even if you are infected with TB, your immune system can attack the bacteria on its own. The infection could clear completely, or it may remain present without any symptoms.Discovery of the suspected case of XDR-TB has alarmed public health officials because this strain of the disease doesn't respond to any of the first-line drugs doctors usually prescribe for TB. This means that doctors must resort to less effective medications, making recovery difficult. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that only about 30 percent of XDR-TB-affected people can be cured.Resistant strains of TB generally develop as a result of partial or incomplete treatment — either because people skip doses or don't finish their entire course of medication or because they're given an ineffective treatment regimen. This gives bacteria time to undergo mutations that can resist treatment with first-line TB drugs.If you think you may have been exposed to someone with TB or XDR-TB, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test and evaluation. The test, which involves the injection of a small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin under the skin, will reveal if you are infected."

My 6-year-old daughter has been prescribed Madopar as a trial medication for what her neurologist suspects is dopa-responsive dystonia. I have read that this drug can impair bone growth. Can you comment on whether this is true?,"Individuals with dopa-responsive dystonia improve dramatically with medications based on the amino acid levodopa (L-dopa), which the body converts into dopamine.The medication Madopar is a combination of levodopa and benserazide. Levodopa enters the brain and increases dopamine levels. Benserazide is a drug that inhibits metabolism of levodopa in the liver, so more levodopa is able to enter the brain. Although animal studies suggest that benserazide may impair bone growth, human studies have found no such effect.Another option for treating dopa-responsive dystonia in children is a drug called Sinemet, which is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Like benserazide, carbidopa also improves symptoms of dopa-responsive dystonia but appears to have no effect on bone growth. Sinemet is available in the United Kingdom."

		Is ear candling a safe way to remove earwax?

		I'm considering having my ears stapled to help me lose weight. Does this work?
	","
Ear stapling for weight loss isn't likely to work — and it poses a serious risk of infection. 

Ear stapling is based loosely on the principles of acupuncture, which involves stimulating certain points with fine needles. With acupuncture of the ear, the needles are typically left in place for only a short time. 

Proponents of ear stapling claim that the staples stimulate a pressure point that controls appetite, leading to weight loss. Small surgical staples are placed into the inner cartilage of each ear. The staples can be left in place for several weeks or even months. 

Although some studies suggest that acupuncture can reduce appetite, ear stapling hasn't been proved effective for weight loss. And the largely unregulated practice of ear stapling can be dangerous if done in unsanitary conditions or by an untrained practitioner. In fact, puncturing ear cartilage poses a risk of serious infection and permanent disfigurement. 

If you're overweight, don't depend on ear stapling for weight loss. Instead, discuss proven weight-loss strategies with your doctor.

The drawback of the PSA test is that elevated PSA levels can occur with cancerous and noncancerous prostate conditions. So false-positive results occur.Initial results from several small studies of the EPCA test are promising. But larger studies are needed to confirm these findings before recommending EPCA as a replacement for PSA testing. Other tumor markers for prostate cancer have been studied.

		Will dietary supplements containing echinacea help me get over a cold faster?
	","
Maybe, but not by much. Recent study results indicate that some echinacea supplements may shorten the duration of a cold by about half a day and may slightly reduce symptom severity. But these results were too minor to be deemed significant. 

In the past, some studies have found echinacea to be helpful while other studies have found no benefit. Part of the problem is that echinacea products can contain different concentrations of the herb, and the echinacea extracts used in these products can come from the flowers, stems or roots of three different echinacea plant species. This makes it difficult to compare study results. 

Echinacea generally doesn't cause problems for most people, but some people taking the herb have reported side effects such as stomach upset or diarrhea.

What causes ectropion?,"Ectropion is the medical term used to describe sagging and turning out of the lower eyelids and eyelashes. As a result, your eyelids don't close or function properly.Normally when you blink, your eyelids move tears across the surface of your eye to the little openings — called puncta — at the inner part of your eyelids. These tears then drain through the puncta into the nose. With ectropion, your eyelids aren't flush against the surface of your eye, so they can't move tears to the puncta as effectively as they should. Tears pool in the corners of your eyes and instead of lubricating your eyes, they flow over your lid onto your cheek.Also, because your eyelids are turned out, they don't properly protect your eyes. As a result, the inside of your eyelids and surface of your eyes are exposed to air and can become dry, irritated and inflamed. Rubbing your eyes in an attempt to relieve symptoms can lead to further irritation, mucous discharge and encrusted eyelids.Causes of ectropion include:Ectropion may also be associated with an underlying medical condition, such as atopic dermatitis or lupus.Common signs and symptoms of ectropion include:Treatment may include:If untreated, ectropion can lead to eye infection, cornea damage and impaired vision."

		Are chicken eggs good or bad for my cholesterol?
	","
Chicken eggs are high in cholesterol, and a diet high in cholesterol can contribute to high blood cholesterol levels. However, how much the cholesterol in your diet can increase your blood cholesterol varies from person to person. 

When deciding whether to include eggs in your diet, consider the recommended daily limits on cholesterol in your food: 

One large egg has about 213 mg of cholesterol — all of which is found in the yolk. Therefore, if you eat an egg on a given day, it's important to limit other sources of cholesterol for the rest of that day. Consider substituting servings of vegetables for servings of meat, or avoid high-fat dairy products for that day. 

If you like eggs but don't want the extra cholesterol, use only the egg whites. Egg whites contain no cholesterol. You may also use cholesterol-free egg substitutes, which are made with egg whites. If you want to reduce cholesterol in a recipe that calls for eggs, use two egg whites or 1/4 cup (59 milliliters) cholesterol-free egg substitute in place of one whole egg.

		What does the term ""ejection fraction"" mean? What does it measure?
	","
Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it contracts. 

During each heartbeat cycle, the heart contracts and relaxes. When your heart contracts, it ejects blood from the two pumping chambers (ventricles). When your heart relaxes, the ventricles refill with blood. No matter how forceful the contraction, it doesn't empty all of the blood out of a ventricle. The term ""ejection fraction"" refers to the percentage of blood that's pumped out of a filled ventricle with each heartbeat. 

Because the left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber, ejection fraction is usually measured only in the left ventricle (LV). A normal LV ejection fraction is 55 to 70 percent. The ejection fraction may decrease if: 

Ejection fraction can be measured with imaging techniques, including:

		What are electronic cigarettes? Are they safer than conventional cigarettes?
	","
Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigarettes, are battery-operated devices designed to look like regular tobacco cigarettes. Like their conventional counterparts, electronic cigarettes contain nicotine. Here's how they work: An atomizer heats a liquid containing nicotine, turning it into a vapor that can be inhaled and creating a vapor cloud that resembles cigarette smoke. 

Manufacturers claim that electronic cigarettes are a safe alternative to conventional cigarettes. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has questioned the safety of these products. When the FDA analyzed samples of two popular brands, they found variable amounts of nicotine and traces of toxic chemicals, including known cancer-causing substances (carcinogens). This prompted the FDA to issue a warning about potential health risks associated with electronic cigarettes.

Until more is known about the potential risks, the safe play is to say no to electronic cigarettes. If you're looking for help to stop smoking, there are many FDA-approved medications that have been shown to be safe and effective for this purpose.

		Are elliptical machines better than treadmills for basic aerobic workouts?
	","
You can get an effective aerobic workout with both an elliptical machine and a treadmill. In general, you can let your fitness goals determine whether you choose an elliptical machine or a treadmill — or a different piece of exercise equipment. 

However, elliptical machines might offer some advantages over treadmills. For example: 

Using an elliptical machine is generally considered low impact. An elliptical machine might be a good alternative to jogging, whether on a treadmill or outside. An elliptical trainer shouldn't cause knee pain if you're using it correctly. You may experience knee pain, though, if you have an underlying knee problem, such as degenerative arthritis. With certain knee injuries, using a stationary bike might be a better option than using an elliptical machine. Talk to your doctor about what exercise is right for you if you have any injuries or health concerns. 

And what if you're training for a 5K run or other road race? A treadmill is probably a better tool to prepare you for running events. But even if running is your main aerobic fitness activity, cross-training with an elliptical machine or other low-impact exercise equipment can help keep you fresh and prevent overload injuries. 

If you use an elliptical machine, remember to maintain good posture to help ensure the most effective workout. Keep your shoulders back, your head up and your abdominal muscles tight. Look forward, not down at your feet. And don't lean on the handles — let your lower body support your weight.

It may. Breathing cold, dry air causes narrowing (constriction) of the airways in some people with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. This restricts airflow into and out of the lungs and makes breathing more difficult. But breathing cold air doesn't permanently worsen emphysema. The effects are only temporary, making you short of breath for a brief period. Cold air can also have the same effect on people with asthma.

"I had a hysterectomy due to endometrial cancer. My surgeon said my cancer was stage I and contained within the uterus. My abdominal fluid tested clear. Nevertheless, he recommends follow-up radiation therapy because the tumor had ""minimally"" invaded my cervix. But his recommendation conflicts with what I have read about the necessity of adjuvant therapy. Can you clarify?"," Endometrial cancer is highly curable with surgery alone if the cancer is confined to the lining of the uterus (endometrium). However, additional (adjuvant) therapy — such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy — may be recommended if the cancer has invaded the muscular wall (myometrium) of the uterus; has spread (metastasized) to involve nearby lymph nodes, blood vessels or the cervix; or if the tumor is high grade (G3 or G4).  Two types of radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer:  Brachytherapy causes significantly fewer side effects than external beam radiation therapy does. Adjuvant radiation therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of a local recurrence of endometrial cancer in the vagina. However, your oncologist can explain why a specific therapy is recommended for you. "

		Can endometriosis recur after a hysterectomy? I had my uterus and ovaries removed two years ago.
	","
Although uncommon, endometriosis can recur after removal of the uterus and both ovaries (hysterectomy with oophorectomy), if you're taking estrogen therapy. Endometriosis is a painful condition in which a type of tissue that normally lines your uterus becomes implanted outside your uterus, most often on your fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis. Endometriosis needs estrogen — which is produced primarily by the ovaries — to persist. If you have your uterus and both ovaries removed, endometriosis pain usually goes away. However, if you're taking estrogen for menopause symptoms, endometriosis may persist or return even after such a procedure. In such cases, endometriosis usually has spread beyond the lining of the pelvis. Talk to your doctor about treatment options for endometriosis after hysterectomy and oophorectomy.

		I just found out I have endometriosis, which my mother also has. She says endometriosis raises our risk of ovarian cancer, so I should have children early and then get a total hysterectomy. What's the real story?
	","
It sounds like your mother jumped to the wrong conclusion after hearing about a connection between endometriosis and ovarian cancer. A total hysterectomy — surgery to remove the uterus and cervix along with both ovaries and fallopian tubes — is a cancer-prevention option for some women. Surgery to prevent ovarian cancer, known medically as prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-ping-go-o-of-uh-REK-tuh-mee), is reserved for women at high risk of ovarian cancer because they have a cancer-related mutation in their DNA, one of the same genetic mutations that cause some breast cancers.

Endometriosis isn't a reason to have a hysterectomy unless you have widespread disease and severe symptoms unresponsive to less invasive therapies. Many women take birth control pills to manage endometriosis. Birth control pills are also associated with a decrease in ovarian cancer risk.

The options for surgery to treat endometriosis aren't limited to hysterectomy, either. It's often possible to remove endometrial deposits from pelvic organs with laparoscopic (lap-uh-row-SKOP-ik) surgery, which requires only a few small incisions in your abdomen.

Ovarian cancer does occur at higher than expected rates in women with endometriosis. But the overall lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with. Some studies suggest that endometriosis multiplies that risk, but it's still relatively low. By contrast, for women who have certain genetic mutations — most commonly, the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, which is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer — the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is as high as 50 percent.

If you're worried about how endometriosis might affect your fertility, that's a different matter. Endometriosis does cause fertility problems for some women, but normal conception, pregnancy and delivery are often possible after endometriosis treatment with birth control pills, other hormonal therapies or laparoscopy, particularly if you're under 35 years of age.

		Can energy drinks really boost a person's energy?
	","
Most energy drinks contain large amounts of caffeine, which can provide a temporary energy boost. Some energy drinks contain sugar and other substances. The boost is short-lived, however, and may be accompanied by other problems.

For example, energy drinks that contain sugar may contribute to weight gain — and too much caffeine can lead to: 

Mixing energy drinks with alcohol may be even more problematic. Energy drinks can blunt the feeling of intoxication, which may lead to heavier drinking and alcohol-related injuries.

For most people, occasional energy drinks are fine, but try to limit yourself to about 16 ounces (500 milliliters) a day. If you're consistently fatigued or rundown, however, consider a better — and healthier — way to boost your energy. Get adequate sleep, include physical activity in your daily routine, and eat a healthy diet. If these strategies don't seem to help, consult your doctor. Sometimes fatigue is a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as hypothyroidism or anemia.

There are a few groups for which energy drinks are typically not recommended. If you have an underlying condition such as heart disease or high blood pressure, ask your doctor if energy drinks may cause complications. Pregnant women and women who are breast-feeding may want to especially limit consumption of these beverages.

With the growing popularity of energy drinks, many parents have become concerned about how much caffeine their kids are getting. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents get no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine a day. Younger children shouldn't drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis.

What causes your lower eyelid to turn in toward your eye? Can it be treated?,"When your eyelid — usually the lower lid — turns in toward your eye, doctors refer to it as entropion. This can cause the skin of your eyelid and your eyelashes to rub against the front surface of your eye, including the conjunctiva (the thin mucous membrane that covers your eye) and cornea (the clear, front part of the eye), which can result in eye irritation. In severe cases, the lashes may scratch the cornea, resulting in infection, scarring or impaired vision. Entropion is most often due to the age-related weakening of eyelid tissues.Entropion may occur intermittently. In such cases, you may notice that the lashes tend to turn in toward the eye with forcible blinking or when you tightly squeeze your eyelids shut.Signs and symptoms of entropion may include:Treatment typically includes:Temporary relief may be provided by applying transparent adhesive tape to the skin of the eyelid near the lashes and extending toward the upper cheek to prevent the eyelid from turning inward."

		Why are epidural steroid injections for back pain limited to three a year? The pain relief usually wears off within six to eight weeks, but I have to wait eight to 10 weeks for another injection.
	","
Epidural steroid injections contain corticosteroids, which mimic the effects of the hormones cortisone and hydrocortisone. When prescribed in doses that exceed the natural levels of these hormones, corticosteroids reduce inflammation around the irritated nerves. This can help relieve pain, although only temporarily.

Epidural steroid injections are usually limited to just a few a year because there's a chance these drugs might weaken your spinal bones and nearby muscles. Steroid injections also suppress the body's natural hormone balance and can lead to adrenal insufficiency, a serious medical condition. Delaying repeat injections allows your body to return to its normal balance. The risk of these side effects may increase with the number of steroid injections you receive and the dose given in each injection.

It's important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits of long-term epidural steroid injections. If you're in pain between epidural steroid injections, you might ask your doctor about other treatment options for back pain.

"My 69-year-old sister has just been diagnosed with epilepsy, but she's never had any seizures. How is this possible?","Epilepsy is a complex brain disorder. Although epilepsy is primarily characterized by seizures, the nature of the seizures can vary depending on the type of seizure and the individual person.In older adults, especially, seizures tend to be more subtle than in younger people and may appear as brief memory lapses or episodes of confusion. In some cases, seizures may cause little or no change in consciousness. Also, involuntary shaking is a less common feature of seizures in older adults. To someone nearby, a person having this type of seizure may simply appear to be staring into space and be unresponsive for a few seconds.Although it can occur at any age, the onset of epilepsy is quite common after age 65. So it is possible that your sister only recently developed epilepsy. The good news is that epilepsy can be treated. Appropriate treatment of epilepsy is important because recurrent seizures may put your sister and others at risk of physical harm — for example, if your sister has a seizure while driving and loses control of the car."

		Are there any herbal remedies for erectile dysfunction?
	","
In a few small trials, some herbal supplements — such as DHEA, ginseng and propionyl-L-carnitine — seemed to offer modest benefit for erectile dysfunction treatment in some men. This limited research is considered preliminary, however. The results are intriguing, but the effectiveness or safety of herbal supplements in the treatment of erectile dysfunction hasn't yet been established. 

In addition, the popular herbal supplement yohimbe — which is marketed as a sexual stimulant — can be dangerous if used in excessive amounts. Adverse side effects may include high blood pressure and heart failure. 

Occasional erectile dysfunction is normal. But if erectile dysfunction persists or becomes a recurring problem, consult your doctor for an evaluation.

Your doctor may recommend this test to determine if a swallowing problem is due to improperly working muscles in your esophagus.When you swallow, muscles in your esophagus normally contract and relax in rolling waves (peristalsis). This action propels food and liquids toward your stomach. Muscular valves (sphincters) at the top and bottom of your esophagus open to let food and liquids in. Then, they close to keep stomach acid from backing up into your esophagus. When these muscles don't work properly, you may have:During esophageal manometry, a tiny, pressure-sensitive tube is inserted through your nose — or sometimes your mouth — and into your esophagus.

My wife has been diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia — yet she has no symptoms. What causes essential thrombocythemia?,"Thrombocythemia refers to a high platelet count. Platelets (thrombocytes) play an important role in blood clotting.

In very large numbers — exceeding 600,000 platelets per microliter — platelets may cause clotting in blood vessels and abnormal bleeding.A doctor may diagnose essential thrombocythemia by blood tests that show a sustained increase in platelets not due to another condition, such as polycythemia vera or chronic myelogenous leukemia. In some cases, thrombocythemia is due to a specific genetic mutation.Some people with thrombocythemia have no signs or symptoms. Others may experience bleeding from the nose or gums, blood clots, heart attack or stroke. When needed, treatment may include:"

A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter.Treatment of essential thrombocythemia depends on the individual's risk of a blood clot or bleeding episode. Not everyone who has essential thrombocythemia requires treatment with platelet-lowering medications. But those who may benefit from platelet-lowering medications — such as hydroxyurea, interferon alpha or anagrelide — include:The choice of which medication to use is complex and based on various factors, such as side effects, potential risks and cost. The most solid data from randomized trials suggest that hydroxyurea is the best first-line therapy for those requiring treatment. However, there are many reasons why one of the other medications may need to be considered. It is important to discuss this with a doctor who is familiar with essential thrombocythemia before considering a treatment.Low-dose aspirin lowers the risk of blood clots in individuals with essential thrombocythemia but has no effect on platelet count."

		Is it OK to exercise if I have a cold?
	","
Mild to moderate physical activity is usually OK if you have a garden-variety cold and no fever. Exercise may even help you feel better by opening your nasal passages and temporarily relieving nasal congestion. 

As a general guide for exercise and illness, consider this: 

Let your body be your guide. If you have a cold and feel miserable, take a break. Scaling back or taking a few days off from exercise when you're sick shouldn't affect your performance. Resume your normal workout routine gradually as you begin to feel better. And check with your doctor if you aren't sure if it's OK to exercise. 

Remember if you do choose to exercise when you're sick, reduce the intensity and length of your workout. If you attempt to exercise at your normal intensity when you have more than a simple cold, you could risk more serious injury or illness.

		I've exercised regularly for years. Now that I'm pregnant, do I need to limit my heart rate while I exercise?
	","
If you exercised regularly before pregnancy, there's no need to focus on your heart rate for exercise during pregnancy.

Years ago, some experts recommended a heart rate of no more than 140 beats a minute for exercise during pregnancy. Today, however, heart rate limits aren't typically imposed during pregnancy. For healthy women, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity — preferably spread throughout the week — without any specific heart rate limits.

Still, reasonable precautions for exercise during pregnancy are important. Get your health care provider's OK for any exercise during pregnancy — especially if you have a history of preterm labor or certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure. Also, be careful to pace yourself appropriately. In general, you should be able to carry on a conversation while you're exercising. If you can't speak normally while you're working out, you're probably pushing yourself too hard. This could lead to vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions or other problems

For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends these exercise guidelines: 

Moderate aerobic exercise includes such activities as brisk walking, swimming and mowing the lawn. Vigorous aerobic exercise includes such activities as running and aerobic dancing. Strength training can include use of weight machines, or activities such as rock climbing or heavy gardening. 

As a general goal, aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day. If you want to lose weight or meet specific fitness goals, you may need to exercise more. Want to aim even higher? You can achieve more health benefits if you ramp up your exercise to 300 minutes a week. 

Short on long chunks of time? Even brief bouts of activity offer benefits. For instance, if you can't fit in one 30-minute walk, try three 10-minute walks instead. What's most important is making regular physical activity part of your lifestyle.

		Eye dilation is inconvenient for me. Is it necessary to have my eyes dilated during every eye exam?
	","
Whether eye dilation is necessary for every eye exam depends on the reason for your eye exam, your overall health and your risk of eye diseases.

During an eye exam, your doctor uses special eyedrops to cause eye dilation. The drops cause the black portion at the center of your eye (iris) to widen, allowing your doctor a good view of the back of your eye. Eye dilation can help your doctor diagnose many diseases and conditions, such as:

Many diseases and conditions can be detected at their earliest stages during an eye exam. For this reason, most eye doctors recommend eye dilation as part of a routine eye exam schedule.

Still, eye dilation can be inconvenient, since it makes it difficult to focus on close objects. This can interfere with your ability to drive or work for a few hours after your eye exam. Eye dilation also makes your eyes more sensitive to bright light. If eye dilation is a great inconvenience, ask your doctor about other tests to examine the back of your eye. Alternative tests are available, but none is proved to be as effective as an exam that involves eye dilation.

In determining whether eye dilation is necessary for you, your eye doctor may consider:

		Is a laser retina scan necessary? My optometrist offers the test, but I'm not sure if I need it.
	","
For most people, a laser retina scan isn't necessary. 

During a traditional eye exam, an eye doctor dilates your eyes with special eyedrops and then checks your retinas for abnormalities using an ophthalmoscope — a lighted magnifying instrument. During a laser retina scan, such as Optomap, your eyes may or may not be dilated. A laser scans your eyes and then produces digital images of your retinas. Your eye doctor can use the images to check for abnormalities. The images can be saved in your medical record and used to compare the condition of your retinas from year to year. 

Some research suggests that laser retina scans can help eye doctors diagnose problems in the retinas. Still, laser retina scans have limitations. For example, although a laser retina scan captures a wide angle view of the retinas, the test might not detect problems on the outside edges of the retinas. 

If you choose to have a laser retina scan, make it a complement to — not a substitute for — a traditional eye exam. This is especially important if you're at high risk of retinal conditions. You might also consider what the procedure costs and whether it's covered by your medial insurance.

Although these eye-exercise programs appear to be fairly sophisticated at first glance, there's little or no scientific support for their claims."
I have persistent eye floaters in my right eye that seem to be getting worse. Should I be concerned?,"Most of the interior of your eye is filled with vitreous, a clear, jelly-like substance. Eye floaters are small bits of debris floating in the vitreous. They may appear as spots, hair or bits of string that dart into your field of vision. Although they can be bothersome, eye floaters in your eye are usually not a serious problem and don't require treatment. Most people learn to ignore them.Rarely, the density and location of eye floaters affect central vision and even interfere with reading. In such cases, a doctor may recommend surgical removal of the floating debris (vitrectomy). However, this surgery also carries risks and may not remove all floaters.Eye floaters are most common in older adults due to age-related changes to the vitreous. Eye floaters usually appear gradually over time and are harmless. However, see your ophthalmologist if you notice a sudden onset or increase in floaters, especially if associated with flashing lights or hazy vision. This could be a sign of a potentially serious eye disorder, such as a retinal tear or retinal detachment."

To do this, move your index finger back and forth from the inner to the outer part of the lid for approximately one minute. Use the same amount of pressure that you use on a computer keyboard. Massage may be more effective if you first use a warm, wet compress on the eyelid for 10 minutes.An eye twitch is usually harmless.

		I have glaucoma and am wondering whether so-called eye vitamins could improve my vision or protect me from further vision loss?
	","
Probably not. A number of different dietary supplements are marketed for eye health. However, there is little evidence that any of these products — often marketed as eye vitamins — can prevent glaucoma or reverse vision loss due to glaucoma.

Few clinical trials of eye vitamins or supplements for glaucoma have been conducted. None has been rigorous enough or large enough to conclude a benefit in managing or treating glaucoma.

However, taking a high-dose formulation of antioxidant vitamins and zinc may reduce the progression of dry macular degeneration — another eye disease. According to research by the National Eye Institute, formulations of vitamins C and E, beta carotene, zinc, and copper may reduce the risk of vision loss in people with intermediate macular degeneration. If you have advanced-stage macular degeneration in one eye, this combination of vitamins may reduce the risk that you'll develop vision loss in your other eye.

If you're interested in trying eye vitamins or supplements, discuss the benefits and risks with your eye doctor.

Is factor V deficiency inherited? How is it treated?,"Factor V deficiency — sometimes called parahemophilia X — is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder. It's caused by inadequate levels of clotting factor V due to a gene defect. This defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means a child must inherit two defective genes — one from each parent — to develop the disease.A deficiency of factor V delays or slows clotting and can result in excessive bleeding. Bleeding can range from mild to severe and may include:A doctor can confirm a diagnosis of factor V deficiency by special blood tests. There's no cure for this disorder. Blood transfusions temporarily correct the deficiency. During bleeding episodes, blood transfusions may be needed daily."
I was recently diagnosed with factor V Leiden. My doctor says I tested positive for the heterozygous form of this disorder. What does that mean?," Factor V Leiden is a common inherited clotting disorder. There are two forms of this disorder — heterozygous and homozygous. Heterozygous is the more common of the two forms.  Factor V Leiden is caused by a gene mutation in clotting factor V. This mutation causes factor V to respond more slowly to protein C, an anti-clotting factor that normally controls the activity of factor V. As a result, people with factor V Leiden have an increased risk of blood clots (thrombophilia).  The gene responsible for the normal production of factor V has two copies. If you inherit only one copy of the defective gene, you are heterozygous. If you inherit two copies — one from each parent — you are homozygous. Those who are homozygous have a much greater risk of blood clots in veins deep within muscle (deep vein thrombosis) that may travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) than do those who are heterozygous.  Factor V Leiden may be detected by special blood tests. If blood clots develop, treatment may include anti-clotting (anticoagulant) medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin). "
What does failure to thrive in an infant mean?,"The term ""failure to thrive"" means an infant isn't growing normally. Babies with this problem weigh less and may be shorter in length than other babies of the same sex and age.The most common cause is inadequate nutrition — which means an infant isn't getting enough to eat or isn't getting enough of the right kinds of foods to develop properly. Rarely, a baby fails to thrive due to an underlying medical condition, such as reflux, cystic fibrosis or celiac disease.It's important to note that infants grow at different rates. Many normal babies go through brief periods when they stop gaining weight or even lose a little weight. However, a doctor would likely be concerned only if a baby doesn't gain weight for three consecutive months during the first year.A doctor can diagnose failure to thrive by using standard growth charts to plot the child's weight, length and head circumference, which are measured at each well-baby exam. Infants who fall below a certain weight range for their age or who are failing to gain weight at the expected rate may require further evaluation.An infant who fails to thrive will also show signs of mental, emotional and physical delays. Early detection and treatment is important for preventing permanent growth and developmental problems.Adapted from the National Center for Health Statistics, 2000"

		Last week, my husband fainted while urinating. His doctor said he might have micturition syncope. What causes this, and what can he do about it?
	","
Micturition (or post-micturition) syncope is fainting during or, more commonly, immediately after urination due to a severe drop in blood pressure. Micturition syncope is most common in older men and usually occurs at night after a deep sleep.

The exact cause of micturition syncope isn't fully understood. But it may be related to opening (vasodilation) of the blood vessels that occurs when getting up and standing at the toilet or that occurs at the rapid emptying of a full bladder. This is thought to result in a sudden drop in blood pressure.

Other factors that may play a role in micturition syncope include: 

<strong>Preventing micturition syncope<br/>
</strong>Micturition syncope is uncommon and should be evaluated by a doctor because it may indicate an underlying medical condition. Prevention of micturition syncope depends on recognizing the factors that contribute to micturition syncope and avoiding them.

		Why do doctors recommend a slow rate of weight loss? What's wrong with fast weight loss?
	","
The concern with fast weight loss is that it usually takes extraordinary efforts in diet and exercise — efforts that could be unhealthy and that you probably can't maintain as permanent lifestyle changes. 

A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is the typical recommendation. Although that may seem like a slow pace for weight loss, it's more likely to help you maintain your weight loss for the long term. Remember that 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat contains 3,500 calories. So to lose 1 pound a week, you need to burn 500 more calories than you eat each day (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories).

Also, if you lose a lot of weight very quickly, it may not be fat that you're losing. It might be water weight or even lean tissue, since it's hard to burn that many fat calories in a short period.

In some situations, however, faster weight loss can be safe if it's done the right way. For example, doctors might prescribe very low calorie diets for rapid weight loss if obesity is causing serious health problems. But an extreme diet like this requires medical supervision. 

In addition, some diets include an initiation phase to help you jump-start your weight loss. For example, the Mayo Clinic Diet has a quick-start phase in which you might lose 6 to 10 pounds in the first two weeks. You can lose weight quickly with an approach like this because it combines many healthy and safe strategies at once — no gimmicks or extreme dieting. After the initial two-week period, you transition into the recommended weight loss of 1 or 2 pounds a week, which is not only safe but also realistic and sustainable for the long term.

		Is it true that occasionally following a fasting diet can reduce my risk of heart disease?
	","
Maybe. Researchers aren't exactly sure why, but it seems that occasionally fasting — not having any food and drink for about 24 hours at a time — can potentially improve your heart health. 

It's difficult to tell what effect fasting has on your heart health because many people who routinely fast often do so for religious reasons. These people generally tend to not smoke or drink alcohol, which also can reduce heart disease risk. 

However, it still appears people who follow a fasting diet may have better heart health than people who don't. This may be because people who routinely fast show self-control over how many calories they eat and drink, and this behavior may translate into better eating choices when they aren't fasting. 

The link between periodic fasting and better heart health may also be linked to the way your body metabolizes cholesterol and sugar. Regular fasting can decrease your low-density lipoprotein, or ""bad,"" cholesterol. It's also thought that fasting may improve the way your body metabolizes sugar. This can reduce your risk of gaining weight and developing diabetes, which are both risk factors for heart disease. 

If you're considering periodically fasting, you should talk to your doctor before doing so. He or she can tell you whether fasting is a good idea for you, and how often you should consider doing so.

		To monitor how much fat I eat each day, which should I focus on — fat grams, fat calories or fat percentages?
	","
All three are useful for determining the amount of fat you're eating, but if you want to use just one method then tracking fat grams is probably the easiest. 

Dietary guidelines suggest that healthy adults generally limit dietary fat to no more than 20 to 35 percent of total daily calories. To figure out how many fat grams or calories that means for you, start with the number of calories you normally eat or want to eat a day. Multiply that number by the recommended percentages to get the range of fat calories you can eat each day. Here's an example based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. 

How many fat grams is that? There are 9 calories in a gram of fat, so you divide the number of calories by 9. 

So if you're on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, 400 to 700 calories can come from dietary fat, which translates to between 44 and 78 fat grams a day. 

Use the Nutrition Facts label to find out how much fat is in the foods you eat. The Nutrition Facts label shows the amount of total fat, saturated fat and trans fat in one serving. This information is shown in grams and as a percent of the suggested Daily Value (DV). The DV is based on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. The Nutrition Facts label also shows how many calories come from fat. If a food doesn't list fat content, look for the information online. 

To monitor the fat in your diet, simply add up the fat grams from all the food you ate during the day and compare the total to your target range. Knowing how much fat is in the foods you eat can help you control the fat in your diet, which can help you meet your health and nutrition goals.

		How can I overcome my fear of public speaking?
	","
Fear of public speaking is a common phobia. It can range from slight nervousness to paralyzing fear and panic. Many people with a fear of public speaking avoid public speaking situations altogether, or they suffer through them with shaking hands and a quavering voice. But with preparation and persistence, you can overcome your fear. 

These steps can help:

If you can't overcome your fear with practice alone, your doctor may prescribe a calming medication that you take prior to public speaking. For example, beta blockers (usually used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions) have been shown to help. Some beta blockers are more effective than others. If your doctor prescribes a medication, try it before your speaking engagement to see how it affects you.

Another approach that may help is to see a psychological counselor who can help you come to terms with your fear of public speaking. 

Nervousness or anxiety in certain situations is normal, and public speaking is no exception. Known as ""performance anxiety,"" other examples include stage fright and writer's block. However, people with severe, debilitating performance anxiety may have a disorder known as social phobia (also called social anxiety disorder). Social phobia may require treatment with medications, psychotherapy or a combination of the two.

"Is infertility inherited? My mother had trouble conceiving. Now, I'm having the same problem.","Infertility is a complex problem that can arise from a number of factors involving one or both partners. Sometimes the exact cause can't be identified. Although female infertility is not directly inherited, many conditions — some with a genetic component — may play a role. For example, some ovulation disorders are inherited. But other common causes of female infertility — such as fallopian tube blockage or damage — are not inherited."

You and your oncologist must weigh the risk of this medication worsening your osteoporosis against its potential benefits in treating your breast cancer.If the Femara has great potential for treating your breast cancer and you only have mild bone loss (osteopenia), it may make sense to continue the Femara.If you have severe osteoporosis and the characteristics of your breast cancer suggest that the Femara will be only marginally effective, you and your doctor may want to consider other medications for your breast cancer, such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex). Although tamoxifen doesn't cause bone loss, it has other potential side effects. Another strategy is to continue using Femara for your breast cancer and combine it with a bone-strengthening medication, such as alendronate (Fosamax).A discussion with your oncologist can clarify these issues."

		I need more fiber in my diet, but I find it difficult to eat enough fruits and vegetables. Is there any harm in taking a fiber supplement every day?
	","
There's no evidence that daily use of fiber supplements — such as Metamucil, Konsyl or Citrucel is harmful. Fiber has a number of health benefits, including normalizing bowel function. It's best to get fiber from food, but fiber supplements can contribute to the recommended daily intake.

If you have intestinal problems, talk to your doctor before adding a fiber supplement to your diet. Also, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether a fiber supplement may interact with any medications you take. Fiber supplements can decrease the absorption of certain medications, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) and carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol). Fiber supplements can also reduce blood sugar levels, which may require an adjustment in your insulin dosage if you have diabetes. If you plan to take fiber supplements, start with small amounts to avoid problems with gas and be sure to drink plenty of fluids every day.

		Do fibrocystic breast changes increase my risk of breast cancer?
	","
No. Fibrocystic breast changes don't increase your risk of breast cancer.

Having fibrocystic breasts is very common. Women with this noncancerous (benign) condition often experience lumpy, painful breasts. The cause of fibrocystic breast changes isn't completely understood. But the condition is likely associated with hormone fluctuations during a woman's menstrual cycle.

Although it doesn't increase your risk of breast cancer, having fibrocystic breasts may interfere with your ability to detect new breast lumps or other abnormal changes that might need to be evaluated by your doctor. It's important to become familiar with how your breasts normally feel so that you'll know when something just doesn't feel right.

My doctor says my high blood pressure is due to a condition called fibromuscular dysplasia. How does fibromuscular dysplasia cause high blood pressure?,"In fibromuscular dysplasia, the muscle and fibrous tissues in arteries thicken and harden into rings — which restricts blood flow through the affected arteries and to the organs supplied by these arteries. When fibromuscular dysplasia involves the renal arteries, blood flow to the kidneys is impaired. This triggers the kidneys to release excessive amounts of the enzyme renin, which increases your blood pressure.The cause of fibromuscular dysplasia isn't known. But you are at increased risk if you smoke or have a family history of this condition.In mild cases, high blood pressure caused by fibromuscular dysplasia may be treated with diet, exercise and medication while your doctor periodically monitors your kidney function.In more severe cases, treatment may include:If the renal arteries can be unblocked and blood flow to the kidneys improved, blood pressure usually returns to normal."

		Is gabapentin (Neurontin, others) an effective fibromyalgia treatment?
	","
Only one high-quality clinical trial has looked at gabapentin (Neurontin, others) as a fibromyalgia treatment. In that study, the drug reduced participants' reported pain, fatigue and sleep disruption more effectively than did a placebo. 

Gabapentin has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia, although some doctors may prescribe it off-label for such use. The FDA has, however, approved a similar drug — pregabalin (Lyrica) — for fibromyalgia treatment. 

Gabapentin and pregabalin were originally approved to treat certain types of epilepsy and nerve pain. Both drugs work by limiting the release of pain-communicating chemicals by nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. 

Because gabapentin is available in generic form, it may be less expensive than pregabalin. But you have to take gabapentin three or four times a day, which makes it less convenient than pregabalin, taken in two daily doses. The most common side effects of both drugs are dizziness and drowsiness.

		Is there any benefit to taking fish oil supplements for depression?
	","
Fish oil supplements may help ease symptoms of depression in some people. As with prescription antidepressants, fish oil appears most helpful for severe symptoms — but it may not be as effective for mild to moderate depression.

Fish oil is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which play an important role in brain function. People with depression may have low blood levels of brain chemicals called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These chemicals are found in fish oil. The best dose of fish oil isn't clear, but it appears that supplements containing 100 to 300 milligrams of either EPA or a combination of EPA and DHA may be helpful in relieving depression.

Supplements aren't the only way to get more omega-3s. Eating fish a few times a week may be the best way to provide your body with enough of these healthy oils. Fish high in omega-3s include sardines, mackerel, salmon, snapper, trout, and canned white tuna. Shellfish, including mussels and oysters, also contain omega-3s.

Fish oil isn't considered a replacement for treatment of depression, but it may be helpful as an addition to prescribed medications or other treatment. Although more studies are needed to determine exactly what role omega-3 fatty acids play in depression, it's still a good idea to get enough of these healthy oils. Omega-3s help protect heart health and appear to have other health benefits.

		What's the Flat Belly Diet, and can it help you lose weight?
	","
The Flat Belly Diet is a weight-loss diet from the editors of Prevention magazine. They say that the Flat Belly Diet will help you shed belly fat and lose up to 15 pounds in just 32 days. The creators also say that you don't have to exercise to achieve these goals but that exercise can boost your results.

The Flat Belly Diet has two phases, a four-day ""anti-bloat"" phase with specific foods and drinks, and a four-week eating plan during which you eat 1,600 calories a day. The Flat Belly Diet emphasizes eating foods that are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). According to the diet's creators, eating food with MUFAs specifically helps you lose belly fat, without exercise. Such foods include olive oil, nuts, seeds, soybeans and avocados. MUFAs are an essential part of every meal on the Flat Belly Diet. The diet also encourages you to eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

The Flat Belly Diet hasn't been shown in large clinical trials to work for weight loss better than any well-balanced, calorie-restricted diet does. You might lose weight on the Flat Belly Diet because it limits total calories and encourages a generally healthy way of eating. 

Although a quick fix to your weight problem may sound appealing, the reality is that successful, long-term weight loss requires a lifelong commitment to healthy eating and exercise. Put your energies into eating a balanced, healthy diet instead of focusing on a single component such as MUFAs.

		I take flaxseed to control my high cholesterol. But I've heard that flaxseed increases the risk of prostate cancer. Is this true?
	","
The evidence is mixed as to whether taking flaxseed may play a role in reducing the risk of prostate cancer or limiting its spread. In addition, current data is limited to only a few studies. In one study involving men diagnosed with prostate cancer, those who took a flaxseed supplement and followed a low-fat diet saw their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels decline. PSA can be a measure of how fast prostate cancer is spreading. 

Other preliminary studies report that a low-fat diet supplemented with flaxseed reduced PSA levels in men with enlarged prostate glands (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and in those with prostate cancer. However, those results may have been due to a reduction in dietary fats. 

Other studies have shown either no positive effect or a negative effect of flaxseed — and the alpha-linolenic acid contained in flaxseed — on prostate health. So overall, it remains unclear whether flaxseed or flaxseed oil has a role in the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer. Controlled clinical trials may help determine whether or not it's useful in the long term.

		How long do cold and flu germs stay alive after infected people cough and sneeze all over everything?
	","
It varies, depending partly on where the germ-laden droplets fall. Experiments with specific cold and flu germs have shown potential survival times ranging from a few minutes to 48 hours or more. How long such germs remain capable of infecting you in day-to-day life is harder to say. 

Germs generally remain active longer on stainless steel, plastic and similar hard surfaces than on fabric and other soft surfaces. Other factors, such as the amount of virus deposited on a surface and the temperature and humidity of the environment, also have effects on how long cold and flu germs stay active outside the body. 

It's easy to catch the flu or a cold from rubbing your nose after handling an object an infected person sneezed on a few moments ago. But personal contact with an infected person — a handshake, for example — is the most common way these germs spread. 

The best way to avoid becoming infected with a cold or flu virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based sanitizer. Also avoid rubbing your eyes or biting your nails. Most importantly — get a flu vaccine every year.

		Should I wear a flu mask to protect myself from the flu?
	","
It can't hurt and it might help. A recent study in The Journal of Infectious Diseases found that wearing a surgical mask and using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer helped reduce the number of influenza-like illnesses in a group of students living in a college dormitory. Another group of college students in the study used face masks alone, which also helped prevent influenza — but not as much as the combination of face masks and hand hygiene. 

People who live in community housing — such as college dorms, nursing homes or military barracks — are at higher risk of influenza infection because they're in contact with more potentially infected people. 

Flu viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly, or you can pick up the germs from an object — such as a telephone or computer keyboard — and then transfer them to your eyes, nose or mouth. 

Flu masks may help block airborne germs, and they may also forestall the transmission of germs from your hands to your mouth or nose. However, the best way to prevent influenza is to receive the flu vaccine, either via an injection or nasal spray.

		Is it safe to get a flu shot during pregnancy?
	","
Yes, it's safe to get an influenza (flu) shot during pregnancy. 

In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a flu shot for anyone who's pregnant during flu season — typically early October through late March. 

Pregnancy puts extra stress on your heart and lungs. Pregnancy can also affect your immune system. These factors increase the risk of getting the flu during pregnancy, as well as developing serious complications of the flu — such as pneumonia and difficulty breathing. 

Flu during pregnancy also seems to increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight. 

A flu shot can help prevent these potential problems. Better yet, a flu shot during pregnancy helps protect your baby after birth. 

Infants are at high risk of complications from the flu, but childhood flu vaccines can't begin until a baby is 6 months old. If you have a flu shot during pregnancy, however, the antibodies you develop will pass through the placenta to help protect your baby from the flu. 

In a 2011 study, babies whose mothers had a flu shot during pregnancy were nearly 50 percent less likely to be diagnosed with the flu during their first flu season than were babies whose mothers didn't have a flu shot during pregnancy. 

When you get your flu shot, be sure to request the flu shot and not the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, so it's safe for both mother and baby during any stage of pregnancy. The nasal spray vaccine is made from a live virus, which makes it less appropriate during pregnancy or while you're trying to conceive. 

If you're allergic to eggs, check with your doctor before receiving a flu shot. You might need to take special precautions, such as waiting in the doctor's office for at least 30 minutes after vaccination in case of a reaction. 

Also check with your doctor if you had a severe reaction to a previous flu vaccine. Although the vaccine isn't recommended for anyone who had a severe reaction in the past, some reactions might not be related to the vaccine. 

The flu shot available during the 2012-2013 flu season offers protection from both H1N1 flu (swine flu) and seasonal flu.

		I got the flu shot last year, but I still got the stomach flu. Why should I bother getting it again this year if it doesn't work?
	","
The flu shot protects against influenza, which isn't the same thing as the stomach flu (gastroenteritis). Gastroenteritis is an infection caused by a variety of viruses, including rotaviruses and noroviruses. Although it is often called the stomach flu, it is not caused by influenza viruses. 

Real flu (influenza) attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs — causing fever, muscle aches, coughing and congestion. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines causing signs and symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps. 

No vaccine is available for gastroenteritis with the exception of two oral rotavirus vaccines — RotaTeq and Rotarix — for infants. However, you can reduce your risk of gastroenteritis by frequent and thorough hand-washing. 

The annual flu vaccine is the most effective way to reduce your risk of getting influenza.

		Does my child need a flu shot this year?
	","
The answer is probably yes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearly flu (influenza) vaccine for all children ages 6 months through 18 years — ideally given in September or as soon as the vaccine is available. 

The flu vaccine is available for children in two forms: 

Whether you choose a shot or nasal spray, keep in mind that children age 8 and younger who are receiving the flu vaccine for the first time or who didn't receive at least one dose of the flu vaccine last year need two doses of this year's flu vaccine given at least four weeks apart. One dose is adequate for children age 9 and older and younger children who've been vaccinated before. If your child needs two doses of the flu vaccine, be sure to start the process early. Children who need two doses of flu vaccine but only get one might not be protected from the flu. For children older than age 2, the second dose doesn't necessarily need to be in the same form as the first dose — for example, one dose can be given as a shot and the other dose as nasal spray. 

The 2011-2012 flu vaccine offers protection from both seasonal flu and H1N1 flu (swine flu). 

Consult your child's doctor if you have questions about flu protection or wonder which type of flu vaccine would be best for your child. Also check with your child's doctor if your child: 

Keep in mind that yearly flu vaccines are also important for close contacts of children younger than age 5.

	","
The flu vaccine is made using eggs. As a result, the vaccine has tiny amounts of egg protein in it. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that if you're allergic to eggs that you can't get a flu shot. In many cases, flu vaccines can be given safely to someone with an egg allergy. 

If you've had a reaction to eggs in the past, talk to your doctor before getting a flu vaccination. Your doctor may send you to a physician who specializes in allergies. A skin test may be needed to see if you truly are allergic to eggs. A nurse or doctor will scratch a tiny amount of egg protein on your skin and watch to see if your skin reacts to it. 

If the skin test is positive, you still will probably be able to get the influenza vaccine. Your doctor may want you to wait 30 minutes before leaving, in case you have a reaction. Some physicians recommend giving 10 percent of the vaccine in one injection, then the remaining 90 percent of the vaccine in a second injection if there is no reaction to the first dose.

		How does Fluzone High-Dose differ from other flu vaccines?
	","
Fluzone High-Dose is an injected flu vaccine formulated for people age 65 years and older. Like other flu vaccines, Fluzone High-Dose is made up of the three flu strains most likely to cause the flu during the upcoming season. The high-dose vaccine, however, contains four times as much flu virus antigen — the part of the vaccine that stimulates the immune system — as regular Fluzone and other standard flu vaccines. 

In response to a regular flu shot, older people produce 50 to 75 percent fewer antibodies, which protect against the vaccine antigens, than do younger adults. Evidence that a high-dose flu vaccine can compensate for this difference comes from studies that found higher post-vaccine antibody levels in older people who received high-dose flu vaccine than in those who received standard flu vaccine. But whether higher antibody levels actually translate into fewer cases of the flu in this age group is unknown. 

In the largest of three clinical studies comparing high-dose and standard-dose flu vaccine, those who received the high-dose vaccine were more likely to develop side effects, such as fever and soreness at the injection site, during the week after vaccination. 

The risks of flu complications are highest for people age 65 years and older, so protecting older people from the flu is particularly important. The Food and Drug Administration accelerated its approval of Fluzone High-Dose on the condition that studies will continue to evaluate the new vaccine's effect on seasonal flu outcomes, such as cases of flu and flu complications, in older people. If, over the next few years, Fluzone High-Dose turns out to be superior to regular flu vaccine by these measures, high-dose vaccine may become the vaccine of choice for older people.

Is there any benefit in taking folic acid supplements to treat or prevent heart disease?,"The bottom line is no. There has been much enthusiasm about the possible role of folic acid supplements in preventing and treating heart disease. But multiple clinical trials involving folic acid supplements have shown no such heart benefits.Folic acid (folate) and other B vitamins help break down homocysteine, an amino acid in your blood. Too much homocysteine is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. For this reason, some scientists have speculated that folic acid supplements may lower homocysteine levels — which, in turn, may reduce the risk of heart disease. However, this effect has not been proved. Also, it's unclear whether high homocysteine levels are a direct cause or simply the result of coronary artery disease.At this time, the American Heart Association (AHA) doesn't recommend use of folic acid supplements by the general public to reduce the risk of heart disease. However, if you are at high risk of heart disease, the AHA does recommend a diet rich in folic acid (folate) and other B vitamins. Good food sources of folate include citrus fruits, tomatoes, vegetables and grain products."

		I've heard that folic acid supplements can improve cognitive function in older adults. Could those with Alzheimer's disease also benefit from folic acid?
	","
There's no conclusive evidence that folic acid supplements improve cognitive function in older adults or in people with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. 

Blood levels of folate are classified as either low or normal in the general population. Low folate blood levels are associated with poor cognitive performance, which could be improved by folic acid supplements. However, folic acid is not helpful for people with normal blood levels. 

One study showed cognitive function was significantly better in one group of older adults who took folic acid supplements than in those who did not. However, the participants were already at some risk of cognitive decline because of deficient blood levels of folate. So the results of this study can be generalized neither to all older adults nor to those with Alzheimer's disease. 

A review of eight randomized, controlled trials found that the use of folic acid supplements has no benefit on cognitive function in healthy adults or in those with mild to moderate cognitive decline or dementia.

So although it doesn't appear that a folic acid supplement would benefit everyone, it may be something worth discussing with your doctor. Keep in mind that in the United States many foods such as breads and cereals are fortified with folic acid. If you're at high risk of developing dementia or have already experienced some cognitive decline, checking your folic acid levels may be a reasonable step.

		What's the difference between a food intolerance and food allergy?
	","
Food reactions are common, but most are caused by a food intolerance rather than a food allergy. A food intolerance can cause some of the same signs and symptoms as a food allergy, so people often confuse the two. 

A true food allergy causes an immune system reaction that affects numerous organs in the body. It can cause a range of symptoms. In some cases, an allergic food reaction can be severe or life-threatening. In contrast, food intolerance symptoms are generally less serious and are limited to digestive problems. 

If you have a food allergy, even a tiny amount of the offending food can cause an immediate, severe reaction. Digestive signs and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea. Other signs and symptoms can include a tingling mouth, hives, and swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat. A life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis can cause breathing trouble and dangerously low blood pressure. If you have a food allergy, you'll need to avoid the offending food entirely.

Food intolerance symptoms generally come on gradually and don't involve an immune system reaction. If you have a food intolerance, you may be able to eat small amounts of the offending food without trouble. You may also be able to take steps that help prevent a reaction. For example, if you have lactose intolerance, you may be able to drink lactose-free milk or take lactase enzyme pills that aid digestion (such as Lactaid). 

Causes of food intolerance include: 

If you have a reaction after eating a particular food, see your doctor to determine whether you have a food intolerance or a food allergy. 

If you have a food allergy, you may be at risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) — even if past reactions have been mild. Learn how to recognize a severe allergic reaction and know what to do if one occurs. You may need to carry an emergency epinephrine shot (EpiPen, Twinject) for emergency self-treatment. 

If you have a food intolerance, your doctor may recommend steps to aid digestion of certain foods or to treat the underlying condition causing your reaction.

		Can adults develop a food allergy?
	","
Most food allergies start in childhood, but they can develop at any time in a person's life. It isn't clear why, but some adults develop an allergy to a food they could once eat with no problem. Sometimes, a child outgrows a food allergy only to have it reappear in adulthood. 

If you have a food allergy, you'll need to avoid the offending food altogether. An allergic reaction can quickly put your immune system into a state of emergency, affecting numerous organs in your body. For certain people, even a tiny amount of the food may cause symptoms such as digestive problems, hives, facial swelling or trouble breathing. Some people with a food allergy are at risk for a life-threatening reaction (anaphylaxis) that requires emergency treatment. 

However, most food reactions aren't caused by a true food allergy. They're caused by a food intolerance, which is generally limited to digestive problems. With an intolerance, you may be able to eat small amounts of the offending food without a reaction. 

Don't ignore a reaction that occurs shortly after eating a particular food. See your doctor to determine what's causing it. Even if you've had a relatively mild reaction in the past, subsequent allergic reactions may be more serious. Get emergency treatment for any severe food reaction.

		How long can you safely keep leftovers in the refrigerator?
	","
Leftovers can be kept for three to four days in the refrigerator. Be sure to eat them within that time. After that the the risk of food poisoning increases. If you don't think you'll be able to eat leftovers within four days, freeze them immediately. 

Food poisoning — also called foodborne illness — is caused by harmful organisms, such as bacteria in contaminated food. Because bacteria typically don't change the taste, smell or look of food, you can't tell whether a food is dangerous to eat. So if you're in doubt about a food's safety, it's best to throw it out.

Fortunately, most cases of food poisoning can be prevented with proper food handling. To practice food safety, quickly refrigerate perishable foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs — don't let them sit more than two hours at typical room temperature or more than one hour at temperatures above 90 F (32 C). 

Uncooked foods, such as cold salads or sandwiches, also should be eaten or refrigerated promptly. Your goal is to minimize the time a food is in the ""danger zone"" — between 40 and 140 F (4 and 60 C) — when bacteria can quickly multiply.

When you're ready to eat leftovers, reheat them on the stove, in the oven or in the microwave until the internal temperature reaches 165 F (74 C). Because they may not get hot enough, slow cookers and chafing dishes aren't recommended for reheating leftovers.

		What are the best foods for healthy skin?
	","
Research on the best foods for healthy skin is limited. Still, antioxidant-rich foods seem to have a protective effect for the skin. 

Consider these skin-friendly foods: 

On the flip side, some foods seem to be associated with skin damage. For example, some research suggests that a diet high in processed or refined carbohydrates and unhealthy fats promotes skin aging. 

Remember, many of the best foods for healthy skin also promote good health overall. Rather than focusing on specific foods for healthy skin, concentrate on a healthy diet in general. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products. Include nuts, seeds and beans in your favorite meals. Opt for whole-grain breads and pasta. Limit sweets. Strive for variety as you're making healthy choices.

		What causes leg and foot swelling during air travel?
	","
Leg and foot swelling during air travel is common and typically harmless. The most likely culprit is inactivity during a flight. Sitting with your feet on the floor for a long period causes blood to pool in your leg veins. The position of your legs when you are seated also increases pressure in your leg veins. This contributes to foot swelling by causing fluid to leave the blood and move into the surrounding soft tissues. 

To relieve foot swelling during a flight: 

Foot swelling isn't a serious problem if it lasts only a short time. But excessive swelling that persists for several hours after you resume activity may be due to a more serious condition, such as a blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis) — especially if the swelling occurs in only one leg and is accompanied by leg pain. If you experience these signs and symptoms, seek prompt medical attention. 

If you're at increased risk of blood clots — because you recently had major surgery or you take birth control pills, for example — consult your doctor before flying. He or she may recommend wearing compression stockings during your flight. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe a blood-thinning medication to be taken before departure.

		How serious are the risks of bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Fosamax) and risedronate (Actonel), when taken for osteoporosis? Can they actually cause additional bone problems?
	","
Like all drugs, bisphosphonates have risks as well as benefits. For well over a decade, though, doctors have prescribed bisphosphonates to millions of people, very few of whom developed major side effects.

Still, reports of an association between bisphosphonate use and two rare but serious problems — osteonecrosis of the jaw and a specific type of fracture in the long bone of the leg (femur) — have raised concerns. Osteonecrosis of the jaw develops when the jaw bone fails to heal after a minor injury — for example, the type of injury sometimes caused by getting a tooth pulled. 

A clear cause-and-effect relationship between bisphosphonate use and jaw osteonecrosis remains unproved. The best estimate of risk is 0.1 percent, meaning the condition occurs in 1 out of every 1,000 women taking bisphosphonates over the course of a year. The risk of a bisphosphonate-related leg fracture seems to be much lower than that of jaw osteonecrosis.

Overall, bisphosphonates are more likely to help you by preventing fractures than to hurt you by causing jaw problems or unusual femur fractures. This is particularly true for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

		What's the difference between a freckle and a mole? I know moles can become cancerous, but what about freckles?
	","
Freckles and moles are areas of increased pigment (melanin) in the skin — but they're not the same thing. 

Freckles are small, flat, pigmented spots on the skin. They vary in color from red to tan to brown. Freckles aren't present at birth. Instead, they develop in time as a result of sun exposure. Freckles occur primarily in sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the nose and shoulders. Freckles rarely develop into skin cancer. However, freckles are especially common in people who have light skin — and having light skin that burns easily increases the risk of skin cancer. 

Moles (nevi) are clusters of pigmented cells (melanocytes). Although they often appear as small, dark brown spots, moles come in a range of colors and sizes. They can be raised or flat and can develop almost anywhere on the body — even between the fingers and toes. Unlike freckles, moles can be present at birth. They often become more prominent with age. Moles also may darken with repeated sun exposure or as a result of hormonal changes in pregnancy. Most moles are harmless. Rarely, a mole may become cancerous. 

Normally, freckles and moles pose no concerns. Be aware of early warning signs, however. If you have a pigmented lesion of any type — whether you think it's a freckle or a mole — that changes in size, shape or color, or becomes painful, consult your doctor.

		How accurate are the blood pressure machines in grocery stores and drugstores?
	","
Not accurate enough to make health decisions regarding your blood pressure. 

The blood pressure machines that you can use free of charge in many grocery stores, drugstores and other locations may have been accurate when first installed. But in order to stay accurate, they must be maintained and recalibrated. Generally, no information is available to the user regarding the care of these devices. As a result, the reading you get has limited value because it may be incorrect. 

In addition, the blood pressure cuffs on these do-it-yourself machines are often too small to get an accurate reading on a number of people with high blood pressure. To ensure accuracy, the inflatable portion of the cuff should cover at least 80 percent of the upper arm. 

It's best to have your blood pressure checked in a medical facility or in a community screening program with trained staff. Before diagnosing or treating high blood pressure, you'll need to have your blood pressure measured in your doctor's office at several separate visits. 

If you need to check your blood pressure more frequently, your doctor can instruct you on the best way to monitor your blood pressure from home. Home blood pressure monitoring can be an inexpensive, accurate way to get regular blood pressure readings.

		Is it possible to freeze a woman's eggs for future pregnancies?
	","
It's possible to freeze a woman's eggs for future use in fertility treatments — but it's quite difficult.

Freezing eggs may be an option for women who are facing cancer treatment that could lead to infertility. Freezing eggs may also be appealing for women who are planning to delay pregnancy or those who have concerns about freezing embryos that might never be used.

Freezing sperm is a relatively common practice for men who are concerned about future fertility. Excess embryos created in the process of in vitro fertilization often are frozen as well. Freezing eggs is more challenging, however. The large size of the egg cell — plus the fact that it's mainly water — complicates the freezing and thawing process. The key to success is managing the water content in the egg to prevent the formation of ice crystals, which can damage the egg.

Currently, eggs are frozen only in a few major centers that provide assisted reproductive technologies, and only a small number of live births from frozen eggs have been reported worldwide. Still, despite technical challenges and limited availability, freezing eggs may give the hope of restored fertility to women who have specific family planning issues.

		Is it OK to give my child fruit juice?
	","
While whole fruit is the best choice, certain types of fruit juice can be a healthy part of your child's diet. 

Recent studies have confirmed that drinking moderate amounts of 100 percent fruit juice doesn't affect a child's weight. However, fruit juice contains calories. Just like any other food or calorie-containing drink, too much fruit juice can contribute to weight gain. 

If you choose to give your child fruit juice, choose 100 percent fruit juice instead of sweetened juice or fruit-juice cocktails. While 100 percent fruit juice and sweetened fruit drinks might have a similar number of calories, your child will get more vitamins and nutrients and fewer additives from 100 percent juice.  Serve juice in a cup — not a bottle — to avoid tooth decay. In addition, serve fruit juice only with a snack or a meal, rather than allowing your child to sip juice throughout the day. If you're having trouble getting your child to eat, don't allow him or her to drink any liquids 30 minutes before meals or snacks. 

To ensure that your child isn't drinking too much juice, follow these limits from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association: 

About 4 ounces (118 milliliters) of 100 percent fruit juice equals one serving of fruit. Remember, though, juice lacks the fiber and other nutrients of whole fruit. Although a reasonable amount of fruit juice each day is fine for most children, be sure to offer your child whole fruit as well.

		What's the significance of a fundal height measurement?
	","
Fundal height is generally defined as the distance from the top of the uterus to the pubic bone measured in centimeters. After the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, your fundal height measurement often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant. For example, if you're 27 weeks pregnant, your health care provider would expect your fundal height to be about 27 centimeters. It isn't unusual, however, to measure somewhat smaller or larger than expected. 

This might happen if you:

In other cases, fundal height that measures smaller or larger than expected — or increases more or less quickly than expected — could indicate conditions such as: 

Depending on the circumstances, your health care provider might recommend an ultrasound or other tests to determine what's causing the unusual measurements. 

Remember, fundal height is only a tool for gauging fetal growth and gestational age — it's not an exact science. Typically, fundal height measurements offer reassurance of a baby's steady growth. If you're concerned about your fundal height measurements, ask your health care provider for details.

		What is a gallbladder cleanse? Is it an effective way to flush out gallstones?
	","
A gallbladder cleanse — also called a gallbladder flush or a liver flush — is an alternative remedy for ridding the body of gallstones. However, there is no reliable evidence that a gallbladder cleanse is useful in preventing or treating gallstones or any other disease. 

In most cases, a gallbladder cleanse involves eating or drinking a combination of olive oil, herbs and some type of fruit juice over several hours. Proponents claim that gallbladder cleansing helps break up gallstones and stimulates the gallbladder to release them in stool. Although olive oil can act as a laxative, there's no evidence that it's an effective treatment for gallstones. Also, people who try gallbladder cleansing may see what looks like gallstones in their stool the next day. But what they are really seeing is globs of oil, juice and other materials. 

Gallbladder cleansing is not without risk. Some people have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain during the flushing or cleansing period. Individual components of the herbal mixtures used in a gallbladder cleanse may present their own health hazards. 

Gallstones that cause no symptoms typically require no treatment. If you have gallstones that require treatment, discuss proven treatment options with your doctor, such as surgical removal, bile salt tablets or sound wave therapy.

		Are gallbladder polyps associated with gallbladder cancer?
	","
Gallbladder polyps are growths that protrude from the lining of the inside of the gallbladder. Polyps can be cancerous, but they rarely are. 

The size of a gallbladder polyp can be a useful predictor of whether it's cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Gallbladder polyps that are less than 1/2 inch (about 10 millimeters) in diameter are unlikely to be cancerous and generally don't require treatment. However, your doctor may suggest follow-up examinations to look for changes in gallbladder polyps that may be an indication of cancer. This can be done using standard abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound. 

Gallbladder polyps larger than 10 millimeters (mm) in diameter are more likely to be cancerous. Treatment of larger gallbladder polyps may include surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). Polyps larger than 18 mm in diameter may pose a significant risk of being malignant. Your doctor may also recommend cholecystectomy if you have a gallbladder polyp of any size accompanied with gallstones.

		What happens if you gain back weight after gastric bypass surgery?
	","
If you begin to regain weight after gastric bypass surgery, talk to your doctor. You may need a thorough evaluation to determine what factors — medical, psychological, lifestyle — could be involved in the weight gain.

You may have gained weight after gastric bypass surgery because of unexpected but natural changes in your stomach and intestine that allow you to eat more and absorb more calories. But it's also possible that your diet and exercise habits have slipped, in which case you must typically lose the regained weight the old-fashioned way — both by reducing your calorie intake and increasing your physical activity.

In some cases, a second surgery to repair — or redo — a gastric bypass may be appropriate. However, a second surgery has an increased risk of complications, including infection, bleeding and leaks in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of these risks, gastric bypass surgery usually isn't redone if you regain weight because of poor diet or exercise habits. 

Gastric bypass surgery can be an effective treatment for obesity, and most people do lose weight after the procedure. But you'll always be at risk of regaining weight, even years later. To help reach your weight-loss goal and prevent weight regain, it's crucial to make lifestyle changes along with having gastric bypass surgery.

What is Gaucher's disease?,"Gaucher's disease — pronounced go-SHAYZ — is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder in which excessive amounts of a fatty substance (lipid) called glucocerebroside accumulate in the spleen, liver, lungs and bone marrow. In some cases, it also affects the brain.Gaucher's disease is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase, which breaks down glucocerebroside. This disorder can be fatal.Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both parents must carry the gene defect in order to pass the disease to their children. If both parents have the gene defect, each child has a 50 percent chance of developing the disease, a 25 percent chance of not being affected at all, and a 25 percent chance of being a carrier of the gene.There are three types of Gaucher's disease. Doctors classify them by age of onset and brain involvement. Type 1 is the most common.A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of Gaucher's disease by a white blood cell examination that shows decreased enzyme activity. There's no cure for Gaucher's disease.

	","
By age 2 or 3, most children establish a clear gender identity. Often, this understanding of being a boy or a girl is consistent with the child's anatomical sex — but not always. In fact, the type of behavior you describe is fairly common for a 4-year-old. There's no need to be concerned about your daughter preferring stereotypically male clothes or toys. Likewise, it isn't worrisome if a young boy likes to play with dolls or other traditionally feminine toys. Simply support and encourage your daughter in her interests and preferences. Avoid judging her, and don't feel guilty or embarrassed by her behavior. 

If your daughter seems to struggle with her gender identity as she enters adolescence, you might consider speaking with her doctor, a school counselor or a mental health provider — especially if your daughter seems distressed by the fact that she's female. Together, you can determine how to address your daughter's gender-identity concerns. Individual or family counseling may be helpful.

		I've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. I've heard that a gene expression profiling test might help in planning my treatment. What is it?
	","
Gene expression profiling tests (Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, others) are used in an attempt to determine the right treatment for the right person with early-stage breast cancer. Early-stage breast cancer is cancer that may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant parts of the body. Gene expression profiling is designed to allow people who don't need additional treatment (adjuvant therapy) to avoid the side effects of unnecessary treatment, and for those who may benefit from adjuvant therapy to receive it.<strong> </strong>A gene expression profiling test analyzes the patterns of a number of different genes within the cancer cells to help predict how likely it is that an early-stage breast cancer will recur after initial treatment.

The effectiveness of gene expression profiling is still being studied in a number of clinical trials. And while some doctors are using gene expression profiling to plan treatment, others are waiting for the results of these studies. Discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of gene expression profiling. These tests are not for people with more advanced breast cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body.

There are a few gene expression profiling tests currently available. More tests are in development.

The virus can also enter your body through skin that has tiny scrapes or tears. 

People can have genital herpes for years without knowing it. The virus can be spread even if an infected person has no genital sores. Because the virus dies quickly outside of the body, it's nearly impossible to get the infection through contact with toilets, towels or other objects used by an infected person.

In these studies, participants began taking ginger orally three days prior to starting chemotherapy. The ginger was taken in addition to a standard medication prescribed to reduce nausea and vomiting. A small number of participants reported side effects including heartburn, bruising, flushing and rash. In another study, taking ginger root powder was effective in reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea in children and young adults ages 8 to 21. Ginger in this study was also given along with standard anti-nausea medications.

Ginkgo biloba, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, is often touted as a memory aid. But it appears unlikely that ginkgo biloba can prevent memory loss associated with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. 

Small, early studies showed modest improvements in cognitive function for older adults with dementia. However, the results of a large-scale study, published in a December 2009 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, found no evidence that ginkgo biloba prevents memory loss or slows the progression of cognitive decline in older adults. This was true for both those who had mild cognitive impairment at the start of the study and for those who didn't.

Probably not.

Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs can impair blood clotting, typically by blocking the ability of platelets to form clots. Ginkgo — a dietary supplement used to treat memory problems, dementia and various other conditions — may also affect the clotting process. Bleeding may be a particular concern when ginkgo is taken with other medications that can affect bleeding, such as ibuprofen. In fact, at least one fatality has been linked to the use of ginkgo and ibuprofen.

		My husband takes glucosamine supplements to treat gout. But I'm wondering if glucosamine, which contains shellfish, may actually worsen gout symptoms?
	","
Taking glucosamine isn't likely to have any effect on gout — either good or bad. 

Gout is a form of arthritis that's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness and tenderness in joints. Gout is caused by deposits of uric acid crystals in a joint. Uric acid is a waste product formed from the breakdown of purines — substances found naturally in the body and in certain foods, including shellfish and organ meats. 

Typically, glucosamine is made synthetically or from the outer shells (exoskeletons) of shellfish — not from shellfish meat. Because glucosamine doesn't contain purines, it isn't likely to increase uric acid levels or aggravate gout symptoms. Likewise, there's no clinical evidence that glucosamine helps prevent or treat gout either.

Glucosamine is a natural compound in your body that helps make your cartilage strong and rigid. In Europe, glucosamine is a prescription drug with a standardized formula. In the United States and some parts of Asia, glucosamine is sold over the counter as a dietary supplement. 

Many people regularly take glucosamine to protect cartilage, as well as to help manage osteoarthritis pain. In theory, some of the glucosamine in dietary supplements makes its way from your digestive tract to damaged joints, where it reinforces worn cartilage. But research has never demonstrated this effect.

Studies randomly assigning people with knee arthritis to two or three years of treatment with glucosamine or placebo have found that the rate of cartilage loss — measured as narrowing of space in the knee joint on X-rays over time — has been about the same in both groups. 

Some experts consider glucosamine supplements harmless. If you're already being treated for arthritis, though, talk to your doctor before you take glucosamine or any other dietary supplement.

		My mother-in-law recently had a chest X-ray and was told she has a granuloma in her lung. What does that mean?
	","
A granuloma is a small area of inflammation in tissue. Granulomas are most often the result of an infection and most frequently occur in the lungs, but can occur in other parts of the body as well. They typically cause no signs or symptoms and are found incidentally on a chest X-ray done for some other reason. 

The most common cause of lung granulomas in the United States is histoplasmosis, a fungal infection that primarily affects the lungs. People who acquire pulmonary histoplasmosis that results in a lung granuloma have almost always spent some time in the Ohio Valley or the upper Midwest. Most people with pulmonary histoplasmosis never suspect they have the disease because signs and symptoms are rare. 

Although granulomas due to histoplasmosis are noncancerous (benign), they may resemble cancer on an X-ray, especially if they haven't calcified — over time, granulomas become calcified and have the same density as bone, making them more clearly visible on an X-ray. 

A doctor may make a diagnosis of granuloma by chest X-ray or, if the granuloma is not apparently calcified, by computerized tomography (CT), which can detect the calcium that isn't evident on the chest X-ray. The images of affected tissue usually show scarring and calcification characteristic of a granuloma. Granulomas almost never require treatment or even follow-up chest X-rays.

		Does grape juice offer the same heart benefits as red wine?
	","
Possibly. Some research studies suggest that red and purple grape juices may provide some of the same heart benefits of red wine, including: 

Grapes are rich in health-protecting antioxidants, including resveratrol and flavonoids. These antioxidants are found mainly in the skin, stem, leaf and seeds of grapes, rather than in their pulp. The amount of antioxidants in grapes depends on many factors, including the kind of grape, its geographic origin and how it's processed. Dark red and purple grapes tend to be higher in antioxidants than are white or green grapes. Likewise, the level of antioxidants such as resveratrol found in wine varies, with higher levels in red wine.

Besides grape juice, other grape products may offer health benefits, including dealcoholized wine, grape extracts and grape powder.

Keep in mind that it's also beneficial to eat whole grapes — not just grape juice. Some research suggests that whole grapes deliver the same amount of antioxidants that are in grape juice and wine but have the added benefit of providing dietary fiber.

		I like to drink grapefruit juice but hear that it can interfere with some of my prescription medications. Is that true?
	","
Yes, grapefruit juice, other grapefruit products and certain other citrus fruits can interfere with several kinds of prescription medications. Don't take these interactions lightly, as some can cause potentially dangerous health problems. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before consuming any grapefruit products or citrus fruits if you take prescription medications. You may need to eliminate grapefruit products from your diet. Simply taking your medication and grapefruit product at different times doesn't stop the interaction. 

Certain chemicals that grapefruit products and citrus fruits contain can interfere with the enzymes that break down (metabolize) various medications in your digestive system. As a result, more medication stays in your body. This can increase the potency of your medication to potentially dangerous levels, causing serious side effects. 

Pomelos and Seville oranges, a type of bitter orange often used to make marmalades and compotes, may have a similar effect. Researchers are identifying other foods that also may interact with medications, so check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns. 

Here are a few examples of prescription medications that can have serious interactions with grapefruit products. This is not a complete list of grapefruit-medication interactions, so check with your doctor or pharmacist to see if your medication is affected.

Grass-fed beef typically comes from cattle that eat only grass and other foraged foods throughout their lives. Often, conventional beef and dairy cattle eat a diet that includes grains, such as corn, at some point. The difference in the diets of the cattle changes the nutrients and fats you get from eating the different types of beef. 

Grass-fed beef may have some heart-health benefits that other types of beef don't have. When compared with other types of beef, grass-fed beef may have: 

Lean beef that's 10 percent fat or less — whether it's grass-fed beef or another type of beef — can be part of a heart-healthy diet. But it's still uncertain whether grass-fed beef adds even more heart-health benefits.

My 12-year-old daughter has patches of gray hair. What would cause this?,Gray hair in a child is an uncommon problem and should be evaluated by a doctor or dermatologist. Causes of gray hair in a child include:Treatment of graying hair in children is the same as for adults and includes hair dye and various styling techniques.
What causes hair to turn gray?,"Gray hair is typically a result of natural aging. Pigment in the hair shaft comes from special cells at the root (base) of the hair. These cells are genetically programmed to make a certain amount of pigment (melanin) at specific ages. At some point in the aging process, these cells make less and less pigment until the hair has very little pigment. White hair has no pigment, and gray hair has some but not as much as a red, black or brown hair.Not all hairs respond in the same way or at the same time. So the graying process usually is gradual. You can't prevent graying. Some people start graying in their 30s, and some not until their 60s. Genetics likely play a strong role in graying.People rarely go gray overnight. If they do, it's typically due to alopecia areata. This condition causes the thicker, darker hairs to stop growing before it affects the growth of gray hairs — giving the impression of graying overnight. Alopecia areata eventually causes roundish patches of hair loss or complete loss of hair on the head or body. Its cause isn't known."
Is it OK to eat potatoes that have green areas on them?,"They're probably OK to eat, if you cut or peel off the green parts. Potatoes turn green due to prolonged exposure to light. The green color is due to the presence of chlorophyll, a natural plant pigment.Although chlorophyll is tasteless and harmless, a potentially toxic substance called solanine develops in the same areas as the chlorophyll. In rare cases, solanine can make you sick, causing signs and symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. However, most of the solanine is in or under the skin. So peeling the potato removes a good amount of it. If you're very concerned, don't eat potatoes that have green areas.Solanine increases in potatoes as they age, sprout or bruise. To reduce greening in potatoes, store them in a dark, dry, cool place. Don't keep them in the refrigerator. The chilly temperatures will speed up conversion of potato starch to sugar, which makes potatoes less tasty and causes them to darken."

		Is it possible to grieve the death of a loved one without crying?
	","
Crying is an important part of the grieving process for many people, but a lack of tears doesn't necessarily indicate that the grieving process has gone awry. 

Although grief is a universal human experience, your response to grief might be highly individual. In addition, many factors can affect the grieving process, including: 

It's OK if you don't feel like crying. You might simply need time and space to grieve the death in your own way. It's important to make sure that you're dealing with your feelings appropriately, however. 

If you're isolating yourself or having trouble handling your usual daily activities — or you feel like crying but can't — seek the help of a grief counselor or other mental health provider. A counselor might suggest various behavior therapies to help you re-establish a sense of control and direction in your life. You might find comfort through a support group. Depending on the circumstances, short-term use of antidepressants or other medications might be warranted as well. 

The grieving process commands respect and requires time. However, unresolved grief can lead to depression and other mental health problems. If you're concerned about reaching a healthy resolution to your grief, seek the professional help you deserve.

		Does ground flaxseed have more health benefits than whole flaxseed?
	","
Most nutrition experts recommend ground flaxseed because your body is better able to digest it. Whole flaxseed may pass through your intestine undigested, which means you won't get all the health benefits.

Flaxseed is high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and phytochemicals called lignans. Flaxseed is commonly used as a laxative (to improve digestive health or relieve constipation). Both flaxseed and flaxseed oil have been used to help reduce total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol levels and, as a result, may help reduce the risk of heart disease. Although flaxseed oil also contains omega-3 fatty acids, it doesn't have the beneficial fiber that the seeds have.

You can purchase raw flaxseed in bulk — whole or ground — at many grocery stores and health food stores. Whole seeds can be ground in a coffee grinder and then stored in an airtight container for several months. Refrigerating whole seeds may also extend their freshness.

Although the Institute of Medicine has not set a recommended daily intake for omega-3 fatty acids, it has established adequate intake amounts of between 1.1 and 1.6 grams a day for adults. One tablespoon of ground flaxseed provides 1.6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.

		What causes hand swelling during exercise? I walk several times a week, and my fingers get puffy to the point that I can't get my rings off.
	","
Hand swelling during exercise is a fairly common problem. The cause isn't completely clear, but hand swelling appears to be a result of the way your body and blood vessels respond to the increased energy demands of your muscles during exercise. 

Exercise increases blood flow to your heart and lungs, as well as to the muscles you're working. This reduces blood flow to your hands, making them cooler. In turn, the blood vessels in your hands may overreact by opening wider — which could lead to hand swelling. 

As you continue to exercise, your muscles generate heat that makes your system push blood to the vessels closest to the surface of your body, to dissipate heat. This response triggers perspiration and may also contribute to hand swelling. 

In rare instances, endurance athletes develop hyponatremia (hi-po-nuh-TRE-me-uh) — an abnormally low level of sodium in the body. Swollen fingers and hands may be a sign of hyponatremia, but other signs, such as confusion and vomiting, are more prominent than is swelling. Drinking too much water, particularly during a marathon or similar long, strenuous event, may cause your body's sodium to become so diluted that you become hyponatremic. Confirmed hyponatremia requires immediate medical attention. 

There's no proven way to prevent or reduce most exercise-related hand swelling. Before you exercise, you may want to remove your rings and loosen your watchband. During exercise, it may help to do occasional forward and backward arm circles. You might also stretch your fingers and then make fists several times during exercise.

"
		Is drinking lighter colored alcoholic drinks an effective hangover prevention strategy?
	","
Drinking lighter colored drinks isn't a good method of hangover prevention — but it may help a little. A hangover is caused by several things, including chemicals in alcoholic drinks other than alcohol. Among the compounds linked to a hangover are products of alcohol fermentation called congeners. Congeners are found in larger amounts in dark liquors, such as brandy, whiskey, darker beer and red wine, than they are in clear liquors, such as vodka, gin and lighter beers. One particular congener — methanol — breaks down into the toxins formaldehyde and formic acid, which can worsen a hangover.

Several studies have investigated hangovers, but none has found an effective method of hangover prevention. While lighter colored drinks may slightly help with hangover prevention, drinking too many alcoholic beverages of any color will still make you feel bad the morning after. Drinking large amounts of alcohol can cause dehydration, low blood sugar, digestive irritation and disturbed sleep — all factors that lead to hangover symptoms. 

The only sure way to prevent a hangover is to drink in moderation or not drink at all. Moderate drinking is considered two drinks a day if you're a man and one drink a day if you're a woman. A drink is defined as 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof distilled spirits.

Be careful, though — some drinks may contain more alcohol than you realize. Often drinks are larger at bars and restaurants. And, some drinks of the same size may contain more alcohol than others. For example, many dark beers contain a significantly higher percentage of alcohol than do lighter beers, and some liquors contain a higher percentage of alcohol than do others.

		Does the HCG diet work — and is it safe?
	","
No on both counts. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised consumers to steer clear of over-the-counter weight-loss products that contain HCG. 

HCG is human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced during pregnancy. As a prescription medication, HCG is used mainly to treat fertility issues. HCG is not approved for over-the-counter use, nor has it been proved to work for weight loss. Companies that sell over-the-counter HCG weight-loss products are breaking the law. 

So why has there been so much talk about the HCG diet? Perhaps it's because the diet recommends severe calorie restriction — typically just 500 to 800 calories a day. People who follow such a very low calorie diet are likely to lose weight, at least in the short term. However, that level of calorie restriction has risks, such as gallstone formation, irregular heartbeat, and an imbalance of the electrolytes that keep the body's muscles and nerves functioning properly. 

If weight loss is your goal, there are safer ways to lose weight. Talk with your doctor or other health care provider about how to make healthy changes that lead to permanent weight loss, such as eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.

		Can chocolate be good for my health?
	","
Healthy chocolate sounds like a dream come true, but chocolate hasn't gained the status of health food quite yet. Still, chocolate's reputation is on the rise, as a growing number of studies suggest that it can be a heart-healthy choice. 

Chocolate and its main ingredient, cocoa, appear to reduce risk factors for heart disease. Flavanols in cocoa beans have antioxidant effects that reduce cell damage implicated in heart disease. Flavanols — which are more prevalent in dark chocolate than in milk chocolate or white chocolate — also help lower blood pressure and improve vascular function. In addition, some research has linked chocolate consumption to reduced risks of diabetes, stroke and heart attack. One caveat: The evidence for the health benefits of chocolate comes mostly from short-term and uncontrolled studies. More research is needed.

In the meantime, if you want to add chocolate to your diet, do so in moderation. Why? Most commercial chocolate has ingredients that add fat, sugar and calories. And too much can contribute to weight gain, a risk factor for high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.

Choose dark chocolate with cocoa content of 65 percent or higher. Limit yourself to around 3 ounces (85 grams) a day, which is the amount some studies have shown to be helpful. Because this amount may provide up to 450 calories, you may want to cut calories in other areas or step up the exercise to compensate.

		Can secondhand smoke increase your risk of having a heart attack?
	","
Secondhand smoke exposure is a risk factor for having a heart attack. It's thought that chemicals in secondhand smoke can irritate the lining of your arteries, causing them to swell (inflammation). This inflammation can narrow your arteries, increasing your risk of having a heart attack. 

Breathing secondhand smoke can also cause the cells in your blood that are responsible for clotting (platelets) to increase in number, making your blood more likely to clot. Too many platelets can cause a clot to form that may block an artery, causing a heart attack or stroke. 

Also, it appears that heart attack rates go down in areas after those areas pass smoking bans. If you smoke, the best way to reduce your heart attack risk is to quit. If you're regularly around smokers, encourage them to quit or smoke in outdoor areas that will reduce the amount of secondhand smoke others will breathe. This is especially important if you have had a previous heart attack or have been diagnosed with heart disease.

		Is there such a thing as heart cancer?
	","
Heart cancer (primary cardiac tumor) is cancer that arises in the heart. Cancerous (malignant) tumors that begin in the heart are most often sarcomas, a type of cancer that originates in the soft tissues of the body. The vast majority of heart tumors are noncancerous (benign). 

Heart cancer is extremely rare. For example, a review of more than 12,000 autopsies identified only seven cases of primary cardiac tumor — an incidence of less than 0.1 percent. At Mayo Clinic, on average only one case of heart cancer is seen each year. 

Although still rare, most cancers found in the heart have come from elsewhere in the body. These include lymphomas that originate in the chest near the heart. Other cancers that can spread to the heart include melanomas and sarcomas. 

Heart cancer may cause the following: 

In cases of marantic endocarditis, the heart valves are damaged by the cancer, and it may cause the valves to malfunction. In severe cases, the heart valves may need to be replaced. Unfortunately, this is often a sign of very advanced cancer and carries a poor prognosis. Another rare type of cancer known as carcinoid tumor at times produces hormones that can damage heart valves. 

Cancer treatments also can affect the heart. Certain chemotherapy drugs can cause damage to the heart. Radiation therapy directed at or near the heart also can cause damage to the heart muscle and increase the risk of coronary artery disease later in life. Data also suggests that some hormonal cancer therapies may increase the risk of heart disease.

Good oral health is important, but taking care of your teeth isn't a proven way to prevent heart disease. 

Poor oral health has been debated as a possible cause of heart disease for many years. In 2012, however, experts from the American Heart Association reviewed the available scientific evidence and concluded that poor oral health hasn't been proved to cause heart disease — and that treating existing gum disease hasn't been proved to reduce the risk of heart disease. 

Both gum disease and heart disease involve swelling (inflammation), but swelling of the gums hasn't been proved to contribute to swelling elsewhere in the body. Similarly, the presence of bacteria on the teeth and gums hasn't been shown to directly contribute to heart disease. 

Even though oral health isn't a key to heart disease prevention, it's still important to take care of your teeth and gums:

		What's a normal resting heart rate?

A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. 

Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute. 

To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. To check your pulse at your wrist, place two fingers between the bone and the tendon over your radial artery — which is located on the thumb side of your wrist. 

When you feel your pulse, count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by 4 to calculate your beats per minute. 

Keep in mind that many factors can influence heart rate, including: 

Although there's a wide range of normal, an unusually high or low heart rate may indicate an underlying problem. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) — especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.

		I read somewhere that folic acid supplements are beneficial for women with heavy periods. How does folic acid help heavy periods?
	","
Folic acid supplements aren't a treatment for heavy periods, or for the type of anemia — iron deficiency anemia — associated with heavy periods. 

There are several types of anemia, all characterized by a shortage of healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. Some types develop when your bone marrow produces abnormal red blood cells as a result of folic acid deficiency. Folic acid supplements correct folic acid deficiency, so that healthy blood cells gradually replace abnormal ones. 

With iron deficiency anemia, the underlying problem is blood loss, occurring over a long enough time to deplete your body's iron stores. When your iron is depleted, your red blood cells can't carry oxygen effectively. Heavy periods are a common cause of iron deficiency anemia. 

If you have iron deficiency anemia, your doctor will likely recommend that you take iron supplements to promote your production of healthy red blood cells and build back your iron stores. In the meantime, birth control pills are an option for shortening your periods and reducing monthly blood loss. 

During your period, try taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or naproxen (Aleve, others). These drugs, often used to treat menstrual cramps, can also lighten heavy periods.

Hepatitis C is transmitted primarily by exposure to blood containing the hepatitis C virus. Transmission rarely occurs from exposure to other infected body fluids, such as semen. 

If you're in a long-term, monogamous relationship with a partner who has hepatitis C, your risk of contracting hepatitis C is thought to be low. For these monogamous couples, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn't recommend routine condom use to prevent transmission. But couples should avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes and nail clippers. 

The risk of transmission is higher if you have multiple short-term sexual relationships with partners who have hepatitis C. Your risk of contracting hepatitis C increases significantly if you have HIV. Under these circumstances, the CDC recommends routine condom use to reduce your risk of transmission. 

If you're concerned about hepatitis C, talk to your doctor. Hepatitis C can be diagnosed by a blood test. Treatment may include medications to help clear the virus from the bloodstream.

End-stage hepatitis C means the liver has been severely damaged by the hepatitis C virus. The hepatitis C virus slowly damages the liver over many years, often progressing from inflammation to scarring (fibrosis) to permanent, irreversible scarring (cirrhosis). A majority of infected people don't even realize the damage has occurred. 

Once you have cirrhosis, the liver is unable to heal itself. Treatment just tries to keep damage from worsening. (Although, in rare cases, cirrhosis can be reversed.) Symptoms of serious end-stage liver disease can begin to appear: 

In some cases, the cirrhosis leads to liver cancer. More often, your liver continues to deteriorate to the point where the liver loses most or all of its function — liver failure. In addition, people with cirrhosis may also develop: 

The only effective treatment for people with end-stage liver disease is a liver transplant. Chronic hepatitic C virus is the most frequent cause of liver transplantation in the United States. Most people who receive a liver transplant for hepatitis C survive for at least five years after their transplant, but almost always, the hepatitis C virus returns. 

If you're diagnosed with hepatitis C or end-stage liver disease, it's very important that you see a doctor who specializes in gastrointestinal diseases or liver diseases (hepatologist).

		A friend of mine has HER2-positive breast cancer. Can you tell me what this means?
	","
HER2-positive breast cancer is a breast cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cancer cells. In about 1 of every 5 breast cancers, the cancer cells make an excess of HER2 due to a gene mutation. This gene mutation and the elevated levels of HER2 that it causes can occur in many types of cancer — not only breast cancer. This is a gene mutation that occurs only in the cancer cells and is not a type of mutation that you can inherit from a parent. 

HER2-positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. They're also less responsive to hormone treatment. However, treatments that specifically target HER2 are very effective. They include: 

In addition, there are several new medications being developed that also target HER2 and are being tested in clinical trials. 

Standard chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin) also can be effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancers, although these drugs don't specifically target the HER2 protein. 

Routine testing for HER2 is recommended for most women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer because the results may affect treatment recommendations and decisions. HER2 testing is not done routinely for ductal carcinoma in situ but may be performed as part of a clinical trial. Whenever breast cancer recurs or spreads, the cancer cells should be retested for HER2 as well as for hormone receptor status, as these can change from the original cancer in up to 20 to 30 percent of cases.

Sildenafil (Viagra) is a prescription medication used to treat erectile dysfunction. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis when you become sexually aroused. Some ""herbal viagra"" supplements are advertised as a cheaper alternative, available without a prescription. 

Some of these products do contain substances that improve blood flow by relaxing the walls of blood vessels. However, none of them focuses specifically on blood vessels in the penis, as do Viagra and similar prescription drugs.

Another reason to be wary is that you can't be certain what you're taking. Some products marketed as ""herbal viagras"" have been pulled off the market because they contain undeclared prescription medications. It can be dangerous to take supplements that contain unknown amounts of prescription medications or other unidentified ingredients.

Some natural remedies may be viable options for easing erectile dysfunction. Examples of herbal remedies used for sexual problems include ginseng, ginkgo, L-arginine and yohimbe. However, there's still limited evidence on how well they work — and some have known dangers. For example, yohimbe can interact with prescription medications and increase heart rate and blood pressure. 

If you have erectile dysfunction, see your doctor to make sure it isn't caused by an underlying health problem or isn't a side effect of medications you take. Your safest bet in treating erectile problems is to rely on your doctor's evaluation and recommendations. Before using any herbal remedy or supplement, check with your doctor to make sure it's safe for you.

		Why do I have to cough during a hernia exam?
	","
A hernia occurs when soft tissue — usually part of the intestine — protrudes through a weak point or tear in your abdominal wall. This bulging is most likely to occur when there's increased pressure on your abdomen, such as when lifting, straining, sneezing or coughing. Forcing a cough during a hernia exam causes your abdominal muscles to contract and increase pressure within your abdomen. This may force a hernia to bulge out, making it easier to detect during the examination.

		What's the difference between a bulging disk and a herniated disk?
	","
Disks act as cushions between the vertebrae in your spine. They're composed of an outer layer of tough cartilage that surrounds softer cartilage in the center. It may help to think of them as miniature jelly doughnuts, exactly the right size to fit between your vertebrae.

A bulging disk extends outside the space it should normally occupy. The bulge typically affects a large portion of the disk, so it may look a little like a hamburger that's too big for its bun. The part of the disk that's bulging is typically the tough outer layer of cartilage. Usually bulging is considered part of the normal aging process of the disk and is common to see on MRIs of people in almost every age group.

A herniated disk, on the other hand, results when a crack in the tough outer layer of cartilage allows some of the softer inner cartilage to protrude out of the disk. The protrusion of inner cartilage in a herniated disk usually happens in one distinct area of the disk and not along a large component of the disk, which is more typical of a bulging disk. Herniated disks are also called ruptured disks or slipped disks.

Bulging disks are more common. Herniated disks are more likely to cause pain. But many people have bulging disks or herniated disks that cause no pain whatsoever.

What causes hiccups? Are there any proven cures?,"Almost everyone gets the hiccups from time to time. Hiccups typically are harmless and go away after a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups may persist for days or even weeks. When this occurs, they can interfere with eating and sleeping. In a few instances, persistent hiccups can be a sign of a serious underlying disorder.Hiccups are caused by involuntary contractions of your diaphragm — the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen and plays an important role in breathing. This involuntary contraction causes your vocal cords to close very briefly, which produces the characteristic sound of a hiccup.Often, there may be no obvious cause for hiccups. But possible causes include:There is no one proven cure for the hiccups. Different things may work at different times and for different people. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the following hiccup remedies may be effective:If your hiccups last longer than 48 hours, consult your doctor. In some cases of prolonged hiccups, prescription medications may help."
What is a HIDA scan?,"A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan helps evaluate the function of the gallbladder and the bile ducts. Doctors may also refer to this procedure as cholescintigraphy.In preparation for a HIDA scan, a dye or other chemical (radioactive tracer) is injected into your vein. The tracer travels to your liver and then into the bile ducts.

What is hidden penis?,"Hidden penis refers to a penis that is normal in size but appears very small because part of it is concealed. This condition may also be called concealed penis or buried penis.Hidden penis is an abnormality that's present at birth (congenital). Causes may include:A doctor can often make a diagnosis of hidden penis on physical examination. In cases where abdominal fat is the cause, hidden penis may improve in the first few years of life as the lower abdomen loses fat and the penis increases in size. In other cases, treatment may include surgical repair.Obesity may also cause concealment of the penis. The lower abdomen may become so large that it hangs low and covers the penis. The penis may also appear to shrink with age due to decreased muscle tone in the lower abdominal muscles and increased fat in the lower abdomen. Such cases of ""hidden"" penis can be reversed with weight loss and strengthening of the abdominal muscles."

		Are over-the-counter cold remedies safe for people who have high blood pressure?
	","
Over-the-counter cold remedies aren't off-limits if you have high blood pressure, but it's important to make careful choices. 

Among over-the-counter cold remedies, decongestants cause the most concern for people who have high blood pressure. Decongestants relieve nasal stuffiness by narrowing blood vessels and reducing swelling in the nose. This narrowing can affect other blood vessels as well, which can increase blood pressure. 

To keep your blood pressure in check, avoid over-the-counter decongestants and multisymptom cold remedies that contain decongestants — such as pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylephrine, naphazoline and oxymetazoline. 

Instead: 

Call your doctor if your signs and symptoms get worse instead of better or last more than 10 days.

When is the best time to take high blood pressure medication?,"The best time of day to take high blood pressure medication depends on several factors, including:Blood pressure normally follows a daily rhythm. It's higher when you get up in the morning and during your waking hours and generally lower while you're sleeping. Most types of high blood pressure medications work for 24 hours, allowing you to take them once a day. But the effects of these medications may not be the same over the entire course of the day. The effects typically start about an hour after you take the medication. They peak four to 15 hours later and then start to wear off over the last eight hours.Some high blood pressure medications are designed to be taken at bedtime and start working in the middle of the night to reduce the increase in blood pressure that occurs when you get active in the morning. Also, some medications may cause drowsiness, which can be a problem during the daytime hours. Generally, you can take those medications at bedtime.Before determining the best time to take your medication, talk to your doctor about any side effects you're experiencing and your blood pressure goals. You can see how the medication affects your blood pressure by taking measurements at home at different times of the day. Then you can track your side effects with blood pressure changes and the time of day at which you take your medication."

		How should high cholesterol in children be treated?
	","
Treatment of high cholesterol in children is controversial. Many doctors think that diet and exercise are the best initial treatment for children age 2 and older who have high cholesterol or who are obese.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends treating high cholesterol in children with prescription drugs, such as statins, for children age 8 and older if a child has a high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol. This is because some researchers think that heart disease in adulthood can begin to develop early in a child's life if his or her cholesterol level is too high.

However, many doctors disagree that cholesterol-lowering drugs are an appropriate treatment, since little research has been done on the safety and effectiveness of these drugs in children. Some doctors also think few children have a cholesterol level high enough to require cholesterol-lowering drugs as treatment.

The long-term effects of using cholesterol-lowering drugs to treat high cholesterol in children haven't been studied much. In addition, certain cholesterol medications, such as niacin, aren't recommended for children because of safety concerns.

Because of disagreement in the medical community about treating high cholesterol in children, talk to your child's doctor about what's best for your child, including exercise and heart-healthy diet options.

		Does cinnamon lower cholesterol levels?
	","
There's little evidence that cinnamon can lower your cholesterol, and cinnamon isn't recommended as a treatment for high cholesterol. Eating a large amount of cinnamon (1 to 6 grams of cinnamon a day) can affect how your body processes sugar and fat. This could theoretically lower your cholesterol. However, there's not much evidence that this happens.

But even if cinnamon doesn't live up to its reputation for lowering cholesterol, it can be a healthy way to add flavor to foods, especially when used in place of adding more sugar or salt.

To reduce your cholesterol, focus instead on lifestyle changes:

If necessary, your doctor may prescribe cholesterol-lowering medication.

I've heard that high cholesterol levels aren't a concern after age 70. Is this true?,"This is a good question without a simple answer. The effects of high cholesterol in older adults and the possible benefits of its treatment have been controversial issues. Many studies have found that high cholesterol levels in the elderly pose a significant risk of death from heart attack or stroke. But some research suggests that lowering cholesterol levels in older adults may increase the risk of death. So what does this mean? National guidelines recommend that treatment of high cholesterol should be based your cardiovascular risk — not on your age. If you have high cholesterol but otherwise have a low risk of coronary artery disease, the use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs isn't recommended unless your low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol is greater than 190 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)."
What causes a high eosinophil count?,"Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. A normal eosinophil count is less than 350 cells per microliter of blood. The exact role of eosinophils in your body is unclear, but eosinophils are usually associated with allergic diseases and certain infections. Potential causes of a high eosinophil count include:Rarely, your eosinophil count increases for no apparent reason. Doctors refer to this as hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).Treatment of a high eosinophil count depends on the underlying cause, if known. Some people with HES who have eosinophil counts benefit from imatinib (Gleevec). Without treatment, high numbers of eosinophils can accumulate in the heart and other organs, which can lead to nerve damage, heart failure, lung disease and blood clots."
What causes high hemoglobin?,High hemoglobin can have many causes. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen from your lungs to your other body tissues.A hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in your blood. Normal values for hemoglobin are 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (gm/dL) for males and 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dL for females.High hemoglobin is usually due to an increased number or abnormality of red blood cells. Causes include:Treatment of high hemoglobin is directed at the underlying cause.
What causes lymphocytosis?,"Lymphocytosis is an abnormal increase in the number of lymphocytes — a type of white blood cell — in your blood. White blood cells help fight infection.A normal, healthy adult has an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 1,300 to 4,000 per microliter of blood. An ALC over 4,000 indicates lymphocytosis.Lymphocytosis isn't a disease but a sign of an underlying problem. Common causes include viral and bacterial infections, such as mononucleosis, influenza or whooping cough (pertussis). A marked increase in lymphocytes may indicate a more serious condition, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Lymphocytosis typically causes no symptoms and is often discovered incidentally when a blood test is done for some other reason."
What causes a high phosphorus level in the blood?,"The most common cause of elevated phosphorus levels (hyperphosphatemia) in the blood is decreased kidney function. Rarely, it's caused by excess intake of phosphorus or vitamin D, which increases absorption of phosphorus from the small intestine. It's important to note that children normally have higher blood levels of phosphorus than adults do.In your body, phosphorus exists almost exclusively as phosphate. Most of your body's phosphate is stored in your cells and not in your blood. So blood level gives only a partial indication of your total body phosphate (phosphorus). Your body absorbs phosphorus mainly from your small intestine. Excess phosphorus is normally excreted by your kidneys.Another uncommon cause of elevated phosphorus levels is an increased shift in phosphate from your cells to your blood. This may occur with certain conditions, such as:Hyperphosphatemia typically causes no symptoms. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause."
What causes a high red blood cell count?,"A normal red blood cell count ranges from 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (mcl) in males and 4.2 to 5.4 million cells per mcl in females.

Causes include:In severe cases, a high red blood cell count can impair circulation and lead to abnormal clotting. Treatment of a high red blood cell count is directed at the underlying cause."
My doctor says I have high uric acid levels in my blood. What does that mean?,"Uric acid is a waste product formed from the breakdown (metabolism) of substances in food called purines.

		I've heard that vitamin C might be an alternative cancer treatment. What can you tell me about it?
	","
The use of vitamin C in alternative cancer treatment isn't new. Proponents claim that large doses of vitamin C are toxic to cancer cells. However, there is no reliable evidence gathered in human studies to support this theory. 

Studies in the 1970s first suggested that large doses of supplemental vitamin C might be of some benefit in the treatment of cancer. But these studies were later found to have serious flaws. Subsequent well-designed, randomized, controlled trials of vitamin C and cancer found no such treatment benefit. 

More recently, vitamin C given intravenously (IV) has been touted to have different effects than vitamin C taken orally. This has prompted renewed interest in the use of IV vitamin C as a cancer therapy. However, there is still no evidence that vitamin C has any effect on cancer. Until clinical trials are completed, it's premature to determine what role, if any, IV vitamin C may play in the treatment of cancer.

		Years ago, I was diagnosed with high-frequency hearing loss and told that hearing aids probably wouldn't help. With all the new technology in hearing aids, am I a candidate now?
	","
Yes. In recent years, hearing aid manufacturers have made great strides in developing hearing aids that are more effective for all types of hearing loss — including high-frequency hearing loss. 

The advent of digital technology has resulted in significant hearing aid improvements. Other types of hearing aids now also work well for high-frequency hearing loss. 

To find the best hearing aid for your situation, make an appointment with an audiologist to have your hearing tested and to discuss your specific needs. Together, you can decide which features will be most helpful for your hearing loss. 

Because it may take some time to get used to a hearing aid, most manufacturers allow at least a 30-day trial period during which you can try out the hearing aid and return it for a refund if you're not satisfied.

		What is high-fructose corn syrup? What are the health concerns?
	","
High-fructose corn syrup is a common sweetener in sodas and fruit-flavored drinks. As use of high-fructose corn syrup has increased, so have levels of obesity and related health problems, leading some to wonder if there's a connection.

Research has shown that high-fructose corn syrup is chemically similar to table sugar. Controversy exists, however, about whether or not the body handles high-fructose corn syrup differently than table sugar.

At this time, there's insufficient evidence to say that high-fructose corn syrup is any less healthy than other types of sweeteners. We do know, however, that too much added sugar — not just high-fructose corn syrup — can contribute unwanted calories that are linked to health problems, such as weight gain, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and high triglyceride levels. All of these boost your risk of heart disease.

The American Heart Association recommends that women get no more than 100 calories a day from added sugar from any source, and that most men get no more than 150 calories a day from added sugar. That's about 6 teaspoons of added sugar for women and 9 teaspoons for men.

If you're concerned about your health, the smart play is to cut back on added sugar, regardless of the type.

		Are high-protein diets safe for weight loss?
	","
For most healthy people, a high-protein diet generally isn't harmful if followed for a short time, such as six months or less, and may help with weight loss. 

However, the risks of using a high-protein diet with carbohydrate restriction for the long term are still being studied. Several health problems may result if a high-protein diet is followed for an extended time: 

If you want to follow a high-protein diet, do so only as a short-term weight-loss aid. Also, choose your protein wisely. Good choices include fish, skinless chicken, lean beef, pork and low-fat dairy products. Choose carbs that are high in fiber, such as whole grains and nutrient-dense vegetables and fruit.

It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor before starting a weight-loss diet. And that's especially important in this case if you have kidney disease, diabetes or other chronic health condition.

Finally, keep in mind that weight loss may be temporary, especially if you return to your previous way of eating.

What can you tell me about hyaluronic acid injections for hip arthritis? Do they relieve pain?,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of hip arthritis. A few small European studies suggest that injections with hyaluronic acid may benefit people with osteoarthritis of the hip. Hyaluronic acid is a substance that is similar to the lubricating material produced naturally in healthy joints.Larger, more rigorous studies are needed to determine what, if any, role hyaluronic acid injections may play in the treatment of hip arthritis. In the United States, hyaluronic acid injections have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis."

		What are the pros and cons of hip resurfacing as an alternative to hip replacement?
	","
Unlike traditional hip replacement, hip resurfacing doesn't replace the ""ball"" of the hip with a metal or ceramic ball. Instead, the damaged hip ball is reshaped and capped with a metal prosthesis. The damaged hip socket also is fitted with a metal prosthesis — similar to what is used in a conventional hip replacement. 

With newer materials, the artificial joint implants used for total hip replacement are lasting longer and may last for decades, although long-term data aren't yet available for newer implants. This isn't an issue for older people who receive a hip replacement late in life. But hip resurfacing might be a better choice for younger people because the procedure leaves more bone intact, which can make it easier to perform a total hip replacement if needed later. 

Resurfacing generally results in a bigger hip ball than what is typically used in a conventional hip replacement, which may reduce the risk of dislocation. But newer implants used for conventional hip replacement now offer the option of a larger hip ball, similar in size to what results from hip resurfacing procedures.

Hip resurfacing is technically more difficult and generally requires a larger incision than what is used for a conventional hip replacement. And the risk of complications is slightly higher with hip resurfacing — even when controlling for factors such as your age, sex and activity levels. Hip resurfacing results in a metal ball on a metal socket, and in a small number of people, these metallic moving parts may cause pain, immune system reaction (hypersensitivity) or, rarely, tissue destruction.

Hip resurfacing isn't recommended for people who have:

What is Hirschsprung's disease?,"Hirschsprung's disease is a rare disorder of the large intestine (colon). It's present at birth (congenital). This potentially serious disease is more common in males than in females and can be inherited.Normally, stool is pushed through your large intestine by muscles in your intestinal wall. These muscles are stimulated by special nerve cells in the intestinal wall. In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerve cells don't develop properly, which impairs the movement of stool. As a result, stool accumulates and expands the large intestine.Signs and symptoms of Hirschsprung's disease often appear shortly after birth. But in mild cases, they may not become apparent until later in life. Signs and symptoms may include:A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease by:Treatment typically is surgical removal of a portion of or the entire bowel segment that lacks nerve cells."
What causes some women to have excess facial hair?,"The amount of hair you have the potential to grow is genetically determined. Women from certain ethnic groups tend to have more body hair than others do. But some medical conditions and medications also can cause excess hair growth (hirsutism).Women with hirsutism have thick, often dark, hair on their faces as well as their chests, abdomens and backs. Hirsutism can be caused by any condition that increases the normally low levels of male hormones in a woman. These conditions are usually associated with other signs and symptoms, such as menstrual irregularities, and may include:Hirsutism can also be caused by hair follicles that are overly sensitive to male hormones. Doctors refer to this as idiopathic hirsutism. The term ""idiopathic"" means ""of unknown origin."" This diagnosis is made when a woman has excess facial hair but has normal female levels of male hormones, no menstrual irregularities and no other conditions that may contribute to excess hair growth.In addition, some medications can cause hirsutism. These include birth control pills, hormones and anabolic steroids.Women may also develop excess facial hair (hypertrichosis) that isn't due to male hormone changes. This excess hair is often very fine and soft (vellus hair). Certain medications, such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and minoxidil (Rogaine), and medical conditions, such as anorexia nervosa, can cause hypertrichosis.See your doctor if you have a sudden increase in facial or body hair, especially if accompanied by irregular periods."

		Can anti-retroviral therapy reduce the risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners?
	","
A growing body of evidence suggests that it can. Several studies of trends in HIV infection and treatment within defined populations have shown that the number of new cases of HIV falls as HIV treatment — called anti-retroviral therapy (ART) — becomes more common. These studies, however, fall short of proving that ART is the variable responsible for reducing rates of HIV transmission. 

Now a large controlled study of nearly 1800 couples in which one partner is HIV positive and the other is not (serodiscordant couples) may provide the missing link. 

Study participants were randomly assigned to two groups. In the first group, the HIV-infected partner began taking ART regardless of the amount of damage his or her immune system had sustained, as measured by the level of CD4 cells. These CD4 cells, a subset of white blood cells, also known as T cells, are the body's first defense against foreign invaders and one of the main targets of HIV. In the second group, the HIV-infected partner did not start ART until the CD4 cell count was too low to fight off AIDS-related infections, or until another marker of advanced immune deficiency developed.  All the couples in the study were counseled to keep using condoms and following other safe sex practices. 

The study was terminated earlier than planned because interim results indicated that HIV-negative men and women in the first group, whose partners received ART immediately, were 96 percent less likely to become infected than were those with partners who were not treated until their immune systems were failing. 

HIV spreads in the body by hijacking CD4 cells and using their DNA to make copies of itself (replicate). In the process, it destroys CD4 cells. Anti-retroviral drugs are designed to halt the replication process and preserve the immune system. Because different types of anti-retroviral drugs attack the virus at different stages of replication, ART combines three or more drugs, a strategy that increases the chances of stopping the progression of the disease. The goal is to lower the amount of virus in the blood (viral load) to the point where it is virtually undetectable in the bloodstream. 

The encouraging results don't mean that HIV treatment eliminates the risk of HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples. Questions remain about whether viral load is an adequate indicator of risk of sexual transmission. Similarly, researchers don't know how closely viral load is correlated with the amount of virus in other body fluids, including semen. Finally, this study looked primarily at heterosexual couples (97 percent of participants); more research is needed, especially in men who have sex with men.

		What's the difference between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?
	","
Both Hodgkin's lymphoma (formerly known as Hodgkin's disease) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are lymphomas, a type of cancer that begins in a subset of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are an important part of your immune system. The main difference between Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is in the specific lymphocyte each involves. 

A doctor can tell the difference between Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by examining the cancer cells under a microscope. If in examining the cells, the doctor detects the presence of a specific type of abnormal cell called a Reed-Sternberg cell, the lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin's. If the Reed-Sternberg cell is not present, the lymphoma is classified as non-Hodgkin's. 

The distinction is important because the treatment and outcomes for each type can be very different.

"I find that weekly home enemas seem to help keep me ""regular"" and prevent constipation. Is there any reason I should discontinue this practice?","Yes, there are several reasons. An enema is a solution injected into your rectum that stimulates evacuation of your bowels. The occasional use of home enemas for constipation is generally safe for most people. However, habitual use of home enemas can be harmful — especially if used for an extended period.Frequent home enemas can increase the risk of injury to your anus and rectum. Also, home enema solutions can irritate and cause changes to the lining of your large intestine (colon). Frequent enemas can be dangerous for people with kidney or heart disease, who are more likely to experience fluid overload (hypervolemia) or electrolyte imbalance.Over time, frequent use of enemas can impair the natural ability of your colon to evacuate stool. If this occurs, you may have to retrain it to go without enemas. You can do this by consuming plenty of fiber and water, taking a bulk-forming laxative, increasing your exercise and taking time to have bowel movements.If you've used home enemas for a long time, your doctor may suggest that you gradually reduce their use to give your body a chance to return to normal. Be patient because it may take many months for your intestines to get back to normal if you've been using enemas regularly.Occasional constipation is normal. But chronic constipation should be evaluated by a doctor. Some doctors may recommend home enemas for people with special health problems. However, enemas should be used only as a last resort for treatment of constipation. If you find yourself relying on enemas, laxatives or any other medication to have a bowel movement, you should consult your doctor."
What is homeopathy? Does it work?,"Homeopathy is a controversial alternative medicine system for treating diseases. The basic principle is treating ""like with like.""

Many homeopathic remedies are diluted to the point where not even a single molecule of the substance remains. According to homeopathy, these remedies supposedly stimulate your body's defenses to prevent or treat the illness.Whether homeopathy is effective in treating illness is still a subject of considerable debate. Most conventional doctors are skeptical of its premise. Also, the majority of well-organized clinical trials on homeopathic preparations have found no evidence that they work.The risks associated with most homeopathic preparations are considered low, so trying such a treatment for a mild illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, isn't likely to be harmful. But relying on homeopathy to treat a more serious illness for which conventional medicine is effective would be ill-advised."

		Is it true that honey calms coughs better than cough medicine does?
	","
Drinking tea or warm lemon water mixed with honey is a time-honored way to soothe a sore throat. But honey may be an effective cough suppressant, too. 

In one study, children age 2 and older with upper respiratory tract infections were given up to 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) of honey at bedtime. The honey seemed to reduce nighttime coughing and improve sleep. 

In fact, in the study, honey appeared to be as effective as a common cough suppressant ingredient, dextromethorphan, in typical over-the-counter doses. Since honey is low-cost and widely available, it might be worth a try. 

However, due to the risk of infant botulism, a rare but serious form of food poisoning, never give honey to a child younger than age 1. 

And remember: Coughing isn't all bad. It helps clear mucus from your airway. If you or your child is otherwise healthy, there's usually no reason to suppress a cough.

Some forms of hormone replacement therapy for menopause may cause monthly bleeding. This includes cyclic hormone therapy preparations that contain a combination of estrogen and a progestin. The progestin is used to prevent endometrial cancer if you have an intact uterus. 

Hormone replacement therapy can result in bleeding that may be light or may be as heavy as a normal period. If you have concerns about your bleeding, you should see your doctor or health care provider. 

Potential causes of abnormal bleeding during or after menopause include: 

In addition to a careful history and physical examination, laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures may be used to identify the cause of abnormal bleeding in menopausal women.

I just found out that I have a horseshoe kidney. Should I be concerned?,"Horseshoe kidney is a common abnormality of the urinary system, affecting about one in every 400 to 800 newborns. In early fetal development, the kidneys start out as a single ridge of tissue that later separates and becomes two kidneys. But in some fetuses, incomplete separation results in a single, U-shaped kidney (horseshoe kidney).Although present at birth (congenital), horseshoe kidney usually causes no signs or symptoms and often goes undetected for years. It may be found incidentally on an X-ray or ultrasound done for some other reason.Horseshoe kidney usually requires no treatment unless it causes problems. Occasionally, it can impair the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which can lead to kidney stones or infection or damage to the kidney. If needed, treatment may include surgery to improve the flow of urine.Be sure to tell any doctor you consult with that you have a horseshoe kidney, especially if you ever need abdominal or pelvic surgery."
What causes hot flashes in men? I thought only women got hot flashes.,"While hot flashes — brief episodes of intense warmth and sweating — are more common in menopausal women, men may experience them as well.Men may have hot flashes when they experience a sudden and substantial drop in the sex hormone testosterone — such as after surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) or when taking medications to decrease testosterone levels for treatment of prostate cancer.Like women, men may also experience hot-flash-like symptoms due to:Hot flashes in a man should be evaluated by a doctor. A blood test can help determine if testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism) is the cause of hot flashes. If the cause of hot flashes can be determined, treatment typically is directed at the underlying cause, such as testosterone replacement or switching medications. If treatment of the underlying cause is not possible, then treatment is directed at reducing the symptoms of hot flashes."

		How many hours of sleep are enough for good health?
	","
The amount of sleep you need depends on various factors — especially your age. Consider these general guidelines for different age groups: 

In addition to age, other factors may affect how many hours of sleep you need. For example: 

Although some people claim to feel rested on just a few hours of sleep a night, research shows that people who sleep so little over many nights don't perform as well on complex mental tasks as do people who get closer to seven hours of sleep a night. Additionally, studies among adults show that getting much more or less than seven hours of sleep a night is associated with a higher mortality rate. 

If you experience frequent daytime sleepiness, even after increasing the amount of quality sleep you get, consult your doctor. He or she may be able to identify any underlying causes — and help you get a better night's sleep.

		I'm aware of the connection between sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer. Does HPV infection increase cancer risk in men, too?
	","
The short answer is yes, but the specific risks are different for men. Most of the time, HPV infection doesn't cause any signs or symptoms in either sex, although some types of HPV cause genital warts. Typically, the immune system eliminates the virus without treatment within about two years. Until the virus is gone, you can spread it to your sex partners. 

But certain types of HPV, known as high-risk types, may cause persistent infection, which can gradually turn into cancer. With the exception of cervical cancer, HPV-related cancers are uncommon. These rare malignancies include cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus and oropharynx — the back of the mouth and upper part of the throat. They usually develop in conjunction with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. 

Men who have HIV and have sex with other men are at particular risk of anal, penile and throat cancers associated with persistent HPV infection. 

Men can prevent the types of HPV that cause most genital warts by receiving Gardasil, which was originally approved as a cervical cancer vaccine for girls and young women. After additional studies, the Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil for males ages 9 to 26, specifically for the prevention of genital warts. More studies are needed to determine whether Gardasil can prevent HPV-associated cancers in men.

		How does HPV cause cervical cancer?
	","
Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) — a sexually transmitted infection — is the most common cause of cervical cancer. When a woman is exposed to HPV, her immune system usually prevents the virus from doing any serious harm. But in a small number of women, the virus survives for years. Eventually, the virus can lead to the conversion of normal cells on the surface of the cervix into cancerous cells. 

At first, the cells may only show signs of a viral infection. Eventually, however, the cells may develop precancerous changes. This is known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Typically, the precancerous changes go away spontaneously. In some cases, however — particularly for women who have altered immune systems — cervical intraepithelial neoplasia may eventually progress to invasive cervical cancer. 

It's not clear why some women are more likely to develop cervical cancer. Some types of HPV are simply more aggressive than are others. Cigarette smoking also increases the risk of cervical cancer. In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, women who smoke are about twice as likely as nonsmokers to develop cervical cancer. 

There are two HPV vaccines available — Gardasil and Cervarix. They offer protection from several of the most dangerous types of HPV. Gardasil is approved for boys and men, girls and women ages 9 to 26. Cervarix is approved for girls and women ages 9 to 25. 

Remember, if you're sexually active, the best way to prevent HPV and other sexually transmitted infections is to remain in a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner. When you have sexual intercourse outside of a long-term monogamous relationship, always have your partner use a condom. Regular screening for cervical cancer and precancerous changes of the cervix is important, too.

		Can huperzine A prevent memory loss and improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease?
	","
Huperzine (HOOP-ur-zeen) A, a dietary supplement derived from the Chinese club moss Huperzia serrata, has received some interest as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. 

Huperzine A acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor — a type of medication that works by improving the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. Small early studies suggest that huperzine A may improve memory and protect nerve cells, which could slow the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's. More studies are needed, however, to determine possible benefits and long-term risks of huperzine A.

For now, most doctors don't recommend taking huperzine A because FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitor medications are available that have been tested for safety and effectiveness. The Alzheimer's Association recommends that you not take huperzine A if you're already taking a prescribed cholinesterase inhibitor, such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) or galantamine (Razadyne). Taking both could cause side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and muscle cramps. Consult with your doctor before starting any dietary supplement, including huperzine A.

What is hydronephrosis?,"Hydronephrosis is swelling (dilation) of the urine-collecting structures of one or both kidneys due to obstruction of urine flow from the kidney. This can impair kidney function. Hydronephrosis isn't a specific disease, but a sign of an underlying problem. Causes include:Hydronephrosis may develop suddenly — due to, for example, passing a kidney stone — and cause severe pain in the back, lower abdomen and groin on the side of the blockage. It may also develop so gradually over weeks or months — due to, for example, a slow-growing tumor — that it causes no symptoms. Urine output usually remains normal as long as one kidney functions properly.A doctor can confirm a diagnosis of hydronephrosis by:Treatment depends on the cause and the severity of the obstruction. Some blockages, such as from blood clots or a kidney stone, can resolve without treatment. Surgery may be necessary to relieve the blockage. Rarely, surgical removal of the kidney may be required."

		Does childhood exposure to germs help prevent asthma?
	","
Children growing up in rural areas, around animals and in larger families seem to develop asthma less often than do other children. According to the hygiene hypothesis, this is due to increased exposure to particular viruses, bacteria or parasites. 

The hygiene hypothesis proposes that childhood exposure to germs and certain infections helps the immune system develop. This teaches the body to differentiate harmless substances from the harmful substances that trigger asthma. In theory, exposure to certain germs teaches the immune system not to overreact. 

But preventing asthma isn't as simple as avoiding antibacterial soap, having a big family or spending time on the farm. For one thing, there are a number of microbes that may cause asthma rather than prevent it, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For another thing, infections that might help prevent asthma can cause a number of other health problems. The type of germs isn't the only factor that plays a role, either. The severity of an infection — and when it occurs during childhood — also appear to matter. 

More research is needed to understand exactly how childhood germ exposure might help prevent asthma. What we do know is that in general, exposure to germs is likely to do more harm than good. Help your child avoid contacting or spreading germs with steps such as thorough hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth, and covering the nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.

		Can hyperbaric oxygen therapy improve recovery from a stroke?
	","
There's no conclusive evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy — which involves breathing pure oxygen in a special pressurized chamber — improves the outcome of stroke. 

Some researchers theorize that increasing the supply of oxygen to the parts of the brain affected by stroke may reduce the extent of irreversible damage. But this has not been proved. Too few people have been studied to say whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy decreases the chance of dying or if it offers other benefits, such as improving the ability to perform everyday tasks. 

Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been found useful in the treatment of a number of conditions — such as decompression sickness and carbon monoxide poisoning — more research is needed to evaluate what, if any, role it plays in stroke treatment.

		My daughter hyperextended her knee yesterday at school. Can this injury be serious?
	","
A hyperextended knee occurs when the knee is bent backward, often as a result of landing wrong after a jump. A hyperextended knee can damage ligaments, cartilage and other stabilizing structures in the knee. 

Young children have softer bones because they're still growing, so a hyperextended knee can result in a chip of bone being pulled away from the main bone when the ligaments stretch too far. In older children and adults, forceful hyperextension may tear one of the knee ligaments, particularly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). 

A knee injury severe enough to cause swelling, pain or instability should be evaluated by a doctor immediately. Even if the injury doesn't need surgical repair, physical therapy may be needed to help restore leg strength and stability.

		A recent chest X-ray showed that I have hyperinflated lungs. What could cause this?
	","
Hyperinflated lungs can be caused by obstructions in the passages that deliver air to your lung tissue. Air gets trapped within the lung and causes it to overinflate. Hyperinflation can also occur when the air sacs in your lungs become less elastic, which interferes with the expulsion of air from your lungs. 

One of the most common causes of hyperinflated lungs is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — a disorder that includes emphysema. Lung problems such as asthma and cystic fibrosis can also cause hyperinflation. 

In some cases, lungs may appear hyperinflated on X-rays for reasons unrelated to lung function. If you aren't experiencing shortness of breath, there's probably nothing to worry about. But the only way to know whether you have something that causes truly hyperinflated lungs is to do a lung function test. If your lung function is abnormal, you should see a lung specialist to identify and treat the underlying problem.

		Is hyperinsulinemia a form of diabetes?
	","
Hyperinsulinemia means the amount of insulin in your blood is higher than considered normal. It isn't diabetes. But hyperinsulinemia is often associated with type 2 diabetes. 

Insulin is produced by your pancreas and helps regulate blood sugar. Hyperinsulinemia is a sign of an underlying problem controlling blood sugar, which requires your pancreas to secrete large amounts of insulin to keep your blood sugar within a normal range. 

Hyperinsulinemia may be caused by insulin resistance — a condition in which your body is resistant to the effects of insulin and your pancreas tries to compensate by making more insulin. Insulin resistance may also eventually lead to the development of type 2 diabetes — when your pancreas is no longer able to secrete the large amounts of insulin required to keep the blood sugar normal. 

Rarely, hyperinsulinemia is caused by:

A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure that can lead to a stroke. Extremely high blood pressure — a systolic (top number) blood pressure of 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure of 120 mm Hg or higher — damages blood vessels. They become inflamed and may leak fluid or blood. As a result, the heart may not be able to pump blood effectively. 

Causes of a hypertensive emergency include: 

A hypertensive crisis is divided into two categories: urgent and emergency. In an urgent hypertensive crisis, your blood pressure is extremely high, but your doctor doesn't suspect you have any damage to your organs. In an emergency hypertensive crisis, your blood pressure is extremely high and has caused damage to your organs. An emergency hypertensive crisis can be associated with life-threatening complications. 

Signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis that may be life-threatening may include:

		I've heard that hypnosis can be used to ease pain during childbirth. How does hypnobirthing work?
	","
Hypnobirthing is a birthing method that uses self-hypnosis and relaxation techniques to help a woman feel prepared, narrow her focus, and reduce her awareness of fear, anxiety and pain during childbirth.

If you're tense or afraid during labor, stress hormones can redirect blood flow to your limbs, heart and brain — the fight-or-flight reaction — and waste precious energy. Hypnobirthing may counteract this process by preventing the release of stress hormones, which potentially reduces the pain of labor.

Hypnobirthing classes typically begin during the third trimester of pregnancy. While specific programs differ, they generally teach participants to use a combination of music, visualization, positive thinking and words to relax the body and control sensations during labor.

Research examining the benefits of hypnobirthing is limited. A 2004 research review found insufficient evidence to show that the technique is effective. A 2006 research review, however, found that hypnobirthing reduced the use of pain medication during labor.

If you're interested in finding out more about hypnobirthing, talk to your health care provider. He or she may recommend a certified childbirth educator or other professional who can help you determine if hypnobirthing is right for you.

		For women, is there any connection between hypothyroidism and infertility?
	","
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain important hormones. For women, there's sometimes a link between hypothyroidism and infertility. Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation, which impairs fertility. In addition, some of the underlying causes of hypothyroidism — such as certain autoimmune or pituitary disorders — impair fertility.

For women, treating hypothyroidism is an important part of any effort to correct infertility. However, sometimes it's not possible to fully restore fertility. In these cases, other interventions may be needed to treat infertility.

If you have hypothyroidism and hope to become pregnant, work with your doctor to make sure your hypothyroidism is under control. Seek additional help from an infertility specialist if needed.

If you have hypothyroidism and become pregnant, tell your doctor promptly. Close monitoring of your thyroid hormone level during pregnancy can promote normal fetal development and reduce the risk of miscarriage.

Does hysterectomy increase the likelihood of early menopause? Some research seems to suggest this.,"Hysterectomy is associated with a slightly earlier onset of menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But the data on this are difficult to interpret.Hysterectomy — the surgical removal of the uterus — is often confused with surgery to remove both the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Menopause occurs abruptly when the ovaries are removed. But if only your uterus is removed, your ovaries remain functional. Although your periods stop and you can no longer become pregnant, you will continue to ovulate until you reach the natural age of menopause, which is usually between the ages of 50 and 52.The question of whether hysterectomy hastens menopause is difficult to answer because menstrual bleeding stops when the uterus is removed. As a result, the precise timing of menopause can't be determined.Some research, however, indicates that women who have had a hysterectomy may reach menopause two to three years earlier than expected. It's unclear why, but possibly the surgery reduces the blood supply to the ovaries, diminishing their ability to produce estrogen and maintain the reproductive cycle. Many women who have a hysterectomy have also had prior surgeries for reproductive disorders such as endometriosis. These surgeries might have damaged the ovaries and sped up the loss of estrogen even before the hysterectomy."

		I'm unsure of my current immunization status. How can I tell if I'm immune to a disease?
	","
The simplest way to determine your immunization status is to check your medical records. Contact your previous doctors for information about your past immunizations. Immunization information systems (IIS) — computerized systems that keep confidential immunization records of people in a specific region — also may be helpful. Contact the local or state health department for details. 

If you have unknown or uncertain immunization status, you're considered susceptible to an infection and your doctor may recommend vaccination — either immediately or on an age-appropriate schedule. Generally, vaccinating someone who's already immune isn't considered harmful. 

Another option is a blood test to check for the presence of antibodies to certain infections, such as measles, rubella, hepatitis or tetanus. Antibodies are substances produced by the immune system in response to natural infections or vaccination. If you have antibodies for certain infections, you're considered immune. 

Keep in mind, however, that vaccines offer protection from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases. The surest way to immunity is to receive a vaccine.

This procedure may cause temporary numbness in your jaws, tongue and teeth. However, numbness in the lower jaw and tongue before surgical removal of impacted wisdom teeth is unusual and may indicate a problem that requires further evaluation.In some cases, impacted wisdom teeth can be associated with cysts and tumors — usually noncancerous. Other types of growths also can occur in the jaw area and result in the symptoms you describe.Consult your dentist about the numbness you're experiencing.

		I'm adopting a newborn, and I'd like to breast-feed the baby when I bring him home. Can I produce breast milk if I haven't been pregnant?
	","
With considerable dedication and preparation, breast-feeding without pregnancy (induced lactation) may be possible. 

Normally, the natural production of breast milk (lactation) is triggered by a complex interaction between the hormones estrogen, progesterone and prolactin during the final months of pregnancy. At delivery, levels of estrogen and progesterone fall dramatically — but levels of prolactin remain high. The result is lactation. 

Similarly, induced lactation depends on the successful replication of this biological process. You may begin with nipple stimulation — ideally, pumping both breasts with a hospital-grade electric breast pump every three hours around the clock, beginning about two months before you expect to begin breast-feeding. This stimulation encourages the production and release of the hormone prolactin. Your health care provider may also prescribe hormonal therapy, such as supplemental estrogen or progesterone, to mimic the effects of pregnancy. In some cases, other medications may be prescribed as well. No drugs have been specifically approved to induce lactation, however, and potential side effects may be a concern. 

Typically, hormone therapy for induced lactation is discontinued shortly before breast-feeding begins. At that point, the baby's suckling is thought to stimulate and maintain milk production. Your health care provider may recommend continued pumping to further stimulate milk production. 

It's important to note that supplemental feedings with formula or donated milk from a human milk bank may be needed even if you're able to successfully induce lactation — especially during the initial weeks of breast-feeding, while you're establishing your milk supply. To encourage continued nipple stimulation, you may choose to use a supplemental feeding aide that delivers formula or donated breast milk through a device that attaches to your breast. Supplemental formula feedings can also be given with a traditional bottle. 

To learn more about induced lactation and how to increase your chances of successful breast-feeding, contact a lactation consultant at a local hospital or clinic.

		How can I protect my baby from infant botulism?
	","
To prevent infant botulism — a rare but serious form of food poisoning — don't give honey or corn syrup (dark or light) to a baby. Both foods are potential sources of Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) spores. Bacteria from the spores can grow and multiply in a baby's intestines, making a toxin that can cause infant botulism. The concern is only for children younger than age 1. 

It's also important to follow food safety tips when canning or preparing food at home for your child. For example: 

Exposure to soil or dust contaminated with C. botulinum also can cause infant botulism. 

Constipation is often the first sign of infant botulism, typically accompanied by floppy movements, a weak cry, and difficulty sucking or feeding. If you suspect your baby may have infant botulism, seek medical help immediately.

		What are the signs of infant constipation? And what's the best way to treat it?
	","
Infant constipation is the passage of hard, dry bowel movements — not necessarily the absence of daily bowel movements. Infant constipation often begins when a baby transitions from breast milk to formula or begins eating solid foods. 

If your newborn seems to be constipated, contact his or her doctor for advice. If your older baby seems to be constipated, try simple dietary changes: 

To ease the passage of hard stools, consider applying a small amount of water-based lubricant to your baby's anus. Don't use mineral oil, laxatives or enemas to treat infant constipation. 

If your baby is struggling and it's been a few days since his or her last bowel movement, it might help to place an infant glycerin suppository into your baby's anus. Glycerin suppositories are available without a prescription. They're only meant for occasional use, however, if dietary changes aren't effective. 

Rarely, infant constipation is caused by an underlying condition, such as Hirschsprung's disease, hypothyroidism or cystic fibrosis. If infant constipation persists despite dietary changes or is accompanied by other signs or symptoms — such as vomiting or irritability — contact your baby's doctor.

		Is it safe to mix fluoridated tap water with infant formula? I've heard that too much fluoride can harm a baby's teeth.
	","
It's considered safe to use fluoridated tap water to prepare infant formula. 

Exposure to fluoride during infancy helps prevent tooth decay. However, regularly mixing powdered or liquid infant formula concentrate with fluoridated water may increase your child's risk of developing faint white markings or streaks on the teeth — a sign of mild enamel fluorosis. Fluorosis is a cosmetic issue that affects both baby teeth and permanent teeth while they're forming under the gums. In children younger than age 8, combined fluoride exposure from all sources — water, food, toothpaste and other products — contributes to fluorosis. 

If you're concerned about fluorosis, you can minimize your baby's exposure to fluoride by using ready-to-feed formula. You can also alternate using tap water and nonfluoridated water for formula preparation, or mix powdered or liquid infant formula concentrate with low-fluoride water most or all of the time. However, if you use only nonfluoridated water — such as purified, demineralized, deionized or distilled bottled water — to prepare your baby's formula, your baby's doctor may recommend fluoride supplements beginning at age 6 months.

		How much should I expect my baby to grow in the first year?
	","
Healthy infants come in a range of sizes. Still, infant growth tends to follow a fairly predictable path. Consider these general guidelines for infant growth in the first year: 

Your baby's doctor will monitor your baby's growth at routine well-baby exams, likely charting your baby's growth on a standard growth chart. Keep in mind that many healthy babies go through brief periods when they stop gaining weight or even lose a little weight. A doctor would likely be concerned only if an otherwise healthy baby doesn't gain weight from one well-baby exam to the next. Your baby's position on the curve in a growth chart isn't as important as the trend of the curve overall.

		I've heard that infant swimming in chlorinated, indoor pools might cause childhood asthma. Is it safe for my 5-month-old to swim indoors?
	","
Some research suggests that infant swimming in chlorinated pools may increase the risk of lower respiratory tract infections or asthma, but there isn't enough information conclusively linking infant swimming and asthma to warrant keeping healthy babies out of indoor pools. 

Some researchers theorize that chlorine — a common disinfectant used to keep pools clean — binds with swimmers' sweat and urine to create byproducts in the water and air that may harm an infant's lungs and put him or her at risk of developing asthma. Indoor pools have higher concentrations of these byproducts than do outdoor pools. Babies are thought to be at particular risk because their lungs are still developing and they tend to swallow irritant-laden water while swimming. 

Studies examining the relationship between infant swimming and asthma, however, have produced conflicting results. For example, one 2008 study found that infants who swam at age 6 months had a greater risk of having an episode of chest congestion or wheezing in the chest up to age 18 months — if their mothers had a history of allergies. But another study published the same year found that infants who didn't swim before age 1 had a greater risk of being diagnosed with asthma at age 6. Similarly, a 2011 study designed to explore cause and effect found that swimming didn't increase the risk of asthma or allergy symptoms. 

If your baby participates in infant swimming in indoor pools and you're concerned about asthma, opt for a well-ventilated facility. Ideally, staff members will open doors and windows in the pool area and use fans to boost airflow over the surface of the pool when it's crowded. Also, be sure to rinse yourself and your baby in the shower before entering the pool to reduce the formation of irritants in the water.

Can stress cause infertility?,"This is a good question with no clear answer. Although there is little doubt that infertility often causes considerable stress, the question of whether stress can cause infertility remains unsettled.Theoretically, stress could impair fertility if it has a direct impact on hormones. For example, emotional stress in some women causes ovulation to stop. Stress could also have an indirect impact on fertility by impairing the desire for sexual intercourse. But there is no definitive evidence that stress alone causes infertility.Certainly, if you are experiencing infertility, you should address any accompanying stress or anxiety. A mental health professional can be helpful in teaching techniques to manage stress."
Why is inflammatory breast cancer so difficult to treat?,"Inflammatory breast cancer gets its name from the red, swollen appearance of the breast. It is an aggressive form of cancer that presents unique treatment challenges. Because inflammatory breast cancer looks like a much more common breast infection call mastitis, the diagnosis can be delayed — which means the cancer has more time to spread.The reason the breast becomes red and swollen is that the cancer cells clog the lymph channels in the skin, which causes fluid to back up into the breast. This swelling can delay surgery to remove the cancer because incisions won't heal properly when swelling is present. Chemotherapy is often used to kill the cancer cells and relieve swelling so that surgery can be done.In addition, inflammatory breast cancer is more likely than other types of breast cancer to spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes or other areas of the body before it is detected. Because of the aggressive nature of this cancer, treatment often includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hormone therapy and trastuzumab (Herceptin)."

Waking up in the middle of the night is called sleep maintenance insomnia, and it's a common problem. Midsleep awakenings often occur during periods of stress. To help stay asleep through the night, try some of these strategies to relieve insomnia:

In some cases, insomnia is caused by a physical condition such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or chronic pain. Treatment for an underlying condition may be necessary for insomnia to get better.

Insomnia can be linked to mental health disorders, particularly depression. Both depression and insomnia may improve with medications such as antidepressants or psychological counseling.

If you keep having sleep problems, talk to your doctor. In order to determine the cause and best treatment for insomnia, you may need to see a sleep specialist. Over-the-counter sleep aids rarely offer significant help for this problem. Your doctor may prescribe medication and have you try some other strategies to get your sleep pattern back on track.

What does Mayo Clinic think about insulin potentiation therapy as a treatment for cancer?,"Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT) is an unproven and dangerous alternative cancer treatment. It's based on the theory that injected insulin increases the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy drugs so that lower doses are needed. Proponents claim that IPT is an effective cancer treatment that also dramatically reduces the adverse side effects of chemotherapy. However, no clinical trials have been done to validate those claims.Advocates of insulin potentiation therapy believe that cancer cells consume more sugar (glucose) than healthy cells do and as a result are more sensitive to insulin. IPT is performed by injecting insulin in the arm, followed by an injection of chemotherapy drugs. The insulin causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which supposedly makes cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy drugs. However, this is unproved. Also, if too much insulin is given, it can cause dangerously low levels of blood sugar, which can result in seizures, coma, shock, stroke and even death.While insulin potentiation therapy has been used for decades in Mexico and some other countries, there is absolutely no scientific evidence that it works or is safe."
"Does insulin cause weight gain? If so, why and what can you do about it?","Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin therapy. There are several potential explanations for this. The best understood of these is that insulin improves the ability of your body to use and store sugar (glucose). When your blood glucose levels are high, your kidneys try to remedy the situation by excreting glucose in your urine. The calories in this glucose have been consumed but not used by the body — so they are lost calories. High blood glucose levels also increase metabolism. Insulin therapy reverses these processes as blood glucose levels return to normal, which can contribute to weight gain.The best way to prevent weight gain is to reduce your calorie intake and increase your physical activity. Decreasing your insulin dosage without dietary restrictions to control weight can lead to high blood sugar and put you at increased risk of diabetes complications."

		Can insulin injections improve athletic performance for an athlete who doesn't have diabetes?
	","
Athletes who have diabetes may use insulin as part of a diabetes treatment plan. Insulin has been banned from use by other amateur and professional athletes, however. 

For athletes, misuse of insulin may potentially improve endurance, promote the development of muscle mass and speed muscle recovery — but that's not the whole story. In addition to the legal and ethical issues surrounding performance-enhancing drugs, misusing insulin poses serious health risks. 

For example, athletes who misuse insulin may experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Left untreated, low blood sugar can lead to seizures or loss of consciousness. In severe cases, low blood sugar can be fatal. Misusing insulin may also lead to insulin resistance, insulin allergy and other potentially serious problems. 

If you're hoping to gain a competitive edge, don't look to insulin or other performance-enhancing drugs. Instead, adjust your training program to safely increase your strength and stamina.

What can you tell me about intrauterine insemination? When is it used? How is it different from IVF?,"Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a procedure in which sperm are placed in a woman's uterus through artificial means. IUI is most often recommended for couples with unexplained infertility or male factor infertility — such as a low sperm count or poor sperm motility. For many couples, intrauterine insemination is a more affordable and less invasive alternative to in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, IUI is not effective for infertility associated with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes.Intrauterine insemination involves injecting sperm directly into your uterus at the time of ovulation. This can be done using either your partner's sperm or a donor's sperm. Before the procedure, the sperm are ""washed"" and prepared for injection. Your doctor uses a soft tube (catheter) to deposit the sperm through your cervix and into your uterus at the time of ovulation. Fertility drugs that stimulate ovulation may be used in conjunction with intrauterine insemination. Success rates for IUI depend on many factors, including your age and the duration and cause of infertility.In vitro fertilization is more complicated than intrauterine insemination because it involves manipulation of the woman's eggs. In IVF, mature eggs are removed from an ovary. The eggs are fertilized in the lab with a partner's sperm or a donor's sperm. Several days later, the fertilized eggs are implanted directly into the uterus. IVF is commonly used for infertility associated with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes. It is also widely used for infertility associated with endometriosis and male factor infertility."

		Does inversion therapy relieve back pain? Is it safe?
	","
Inversion therapy doesn't provide lasting relief from back pain, and it's not safe for everyone. Inversion therapy involves hanging upside down, and the head-down position could be risky for anyone with high blood pressure, heart disease or glaucoma.

In theory, inversion therapy takes gravitational pressure off the nerve roots and disks in your spine and increases the space between vertebrae. Inversion therapy is one example of the many ways in which stretching the spine (spinal traction) has been used in an attempt to relieve back pain.

Well-designed studies evaluating spinal traction have found the technique ineffective for long-term relief. However, some people find traction temporarily helpful as part of a more comprehensive treatment program for lower back pain caused by spinal disk compression.

Your heartbeat slows and your blood pressure increases when you remain inverted for more than a couple of minutes — and the pressure within your eyeballs jumps dramatically. For these reasons, you should not try inversion therapy if you have high blood pressure, heart disease or glaucoma.

		Is fibromyalgia hereditary?
	","
Fibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children the way diseases such as cystic fibrosis and hemophilia are. But family studies have found that the odds of having fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia. These observations suggest that heredity is a factor in causing fibromyalgia. 

In fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families. Each of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to things that hurt, such as pressure and heat. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.

Researchers are now trying to connect differences in individuals' pain thresholds to particular variants of specific genes. A variant of the gene that determines how efficiently nerve cells recycle the neurotransmitter serotonin has already been correlated with heightened pain sensitivity.

		Is having a high systolic (top number) blood pressure, but a normal diastolic (bottom number) cause for concern?
	","
Yes. If you have a diastolic number — the bottom number of a blood pressure measurement — less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a systolic number — the top number of a blood pressure measurement — greater than 140 mm Hg, you have a common type of high blood pressure called isolated systolic hypertension. Isolated systolic hypertension can be caused by underlying conditions such as a leaky heart valve or an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). 

For years, doctors focused primarily on diastolic blood pressure. The theory was that the body could tolerate occasional increases in systolic blood pressure, but consistently high diastolic pressure could lead to health problems. However, doctors now know that high systolic pressure is as important as high diastolic pressure — and even more important in people older than age 50. 

The recommended goal for systolic pressure is less than 140 mm Hg. For people who are 80 or older, the target systolic pressure ranges from 140 to 145 mmHg. In people with isolated systolic hypertension, treatment may lower diastolic pressure too much, potentially increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. So if you have isolated systolic hypertension, your doctor may recommend that your diastolic pressure not be reduced to less than 70 mm Hg in trying to reach your target systolic pressure. 

Isolated systolic hypertension, when combined with other risk factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise, can lead to serious health problems, such as:

		Are isometric exercises a good way to build strength?
	","
Isometric exercises are contractions of a particular muscle or group of muscles. During isometric exercises, the muscle doesn't noticeably change length and the affected joint doesn't move. Isometric exercises don't effectively build strength but can help maintain muscle strength — most often in a rehabilitative setting. 

Because isometric exercises are done in one position without movement, they'll improve strength in only one particular position. You'd have to do various isometric exercises through your limb's whole range of motion to improve muscle strength across the range. In addition, since isometric exercises are done in a static position, they won't help improve speed or athletic performance. 

Isometric exercises may be helpful to someone who's been injured or has a condition such as arthritis, which could make movement painful or be aggravated by using muscles to move a joint through the full range of motion. For instance, if you injure your rotator cuff, your doctor or physical therapist might initially recommend isometric exercises involving the group of muscles that helps stabilize the shoulder to maintain shoulder strength during recovery. 

It's also important to note that isometric exercises generally aren't recommended for people who have high blood pressure or heart problems, because the large increase in muscle tension caused by isometric exercises can dramatically increase blood pressure.

		My doctor recently commented that I have ""loose joints."" What does this mean?
	","
""Loose joints"" is a lay term that may be used to describe hypermobile joints. Joint hypermobility — the ability of a joint to move beyond its normal range of motion — is common in children and decreases with age.

Having a few hypermobile joints isn't unusual. In most people, joint hypermobility causes no problems and requires no treatment.

But in some people, hypermobility causes joint pain and results in a higher incidence of dislocations, sprains and secondary osteoarthritis. Doctors refer to this as benign hypermobility syndrome. In benign hypermobility syndrome, the ligaments that provide joint stability are loose and weak. This increases the risk of ligament injury or strain and can cause pain.

If you have joint pain and other symptoms of hypermobility, your doctor may check for specific signs, which include the ability to:

Results of this assessment are known as Beighton scores. The highest possible Beighton score is 9 — one point for each hypermobile joint. A Beighton score of 4 or higher, along with pain in at least four joints for more than three months, indicates benign hypermobility syndrome.

Treatment of benign hypermobility syndrome includes:

Occasionally, joint hypermobility is a sign of a rare, serious disorder, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan syndrome. For this reason, joint hypermobility accompanied by joint pain should be evaluated by a doctor to determine the cause.

		Is juicing healthier than eating whole fruits or vegetables?
	","
Juicing probably is not any healthier than eating whole fruits and vegetables. Juicing extracts the juice from fresh fruits or vegetables. The resulting liquid contains most of the vitamins, minerals and plant chemicals (phytonutrients) found in the whole fruit. However, whole fruits and vegetables also have healthy fiber, which is lost during most juicing.

Proponents say that juicing is better for you than is eating whole fruits and vegetables because your body can absorb the nutrients better and it gives your digestive system a rest from working on fiber. They say that juicing can reduce your risk of cancer, boost your immune system, help you remove toxins from your body, aid digestion, and help you lose weight.

But there's no sound scientific evidence that extracted juices are healthier than the juice you get by eating the fruit or vegetable itself. On the other hand, if you don't enjoy eating fresh fruits and vegetables, juicing may be a fun way to add them to your diet or to try fruits and vegetables you normally wouldn't eat. You can find many juicing recipes online or mix up your own combinations of fruits and vegetables to suit your taste.

If you do try juicing, make only as much juice as you can drink at one time because fresh squeezed juice can quickly develop harmful bacteria. And when juicing, try to keep some of the pulp. Not only does it have healthy fiber, but it can help fill you up. If you buy commercially produced fresh juice from a juicing stand or store, select a pasteurized product. Note that juices from some fruits and vegetables can contain more sugar than you might realize, and this can add unwanted calories and lead to weight gain.

		Can a junk food diet increase your risk of depression?
	","
Depression and diet may be related. Some preliminary research suggests that having a poor diet can make you more vulnerable to depression. Researchers in Britain looked at depression and diet in more than 3,000 middle-aged office workers over the course of five years. They found that people who ate a junk food diet — one that was high in processed meat, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried food, refined cereals and high-fat dairy products — were more likely to report symptoms of depression.

The good news is that the people who ate a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish were less likely to report being depressed. These results are in line with other research findings that healthy diets help protect against disease. For example, studies suggest that people who follow the Mediterranean diet — which emphasizes fruits, vegetables and fish, and limits meat and dairy products — have lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. 

More research is needed on the connection between depression and diet. In the meantime, you might want to eat your veggies and cut back on the junk food.

Don't treat infant constipation with corn (Karo) syrup. 

Dark corn syrup was once a common home remedy for infant constipation. However, today's commercially prepared dark corn syrup might not contain the type of chemical structure that draws fluid into the intestine and softens stool. This makes dark corn syrup ineffective for infant constipation.

If infant constipation continues despite dietary changes or is accompanied by other signs or symptoms, such as vomiting or poor weight gain, contact your baby's doctor. 

If necessary, the doctor might remove dried stool from your baby's anus. If your baby is older than age 6 months, the doctor might prescribe osmotic laxatives — which soften stool by increasing the amount of water released within the intestines.

Some of my college friends frequent a bar that serves beverages made with kava. They say kava relieves stress and helps them relax. Is this safe?,"In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned of a possible link between kava — a popular herbal supplement — and liver failure. However, the FDA didn't ban sales of kava in the United States. The concern about liver damage mainly involves kava in its concentrated supplement form. It isn't known if kava beverages — which contain a less concentrated form of the herb — carry a similar risk.Clinical studies have shown that kava has a sedating effect that may reduce anxiety in some people. Kava comes from the root of a pepper plant (Piper methysticum) that is native to the South Pacific Islands. Extracts of the root are sold as supplements in many health food stores. The root of the kava plant may also be ground into a powder, mixed with water and consumed as a beverage.Kava beverages have long been a popular social drink in the South Pacific, much like alcohol is used in other areas of the world. Now, kava bars are springing up around the United States offering a variety of kava teas, juices and coffees.In small amounts, kava may relieve stress and help you relax. As with alcohol, however, drinking too much kava can cause intoxication and impair your ability to drive. Signs and symptoms of intoxication include drowsiness, blurred vision and muscle weakness. Also, mixing alcohol with kava can increase these effects. So even if you're just going to a kava bar, you will still need to appoint a designated driver.Although the risk of liver damage from kava is low, talk to your doctor before taking a kava supplement or consuming kava beverages if you have or are at high risk of liver problems."

Most children can tolerate going without food for a brief period with no serious side effects. But in children with certain inherited metabolic disorders or hormone deficiencies, skipping a meal may result in low blood sugar.In ketotic hypoglycemia, the body doesn't have enough stored carbohydrates to correct the low blood sugar because its stores are easily depleted. As a result, the body converts fats into usable carbohydrates (gluconeogenesis) to meet energy needs. A byproduct of this process is ketones. When ketones build up in the blood, they can lead to serious problems, such as coma.Signs and symptoms of ketotic hypoglycemia include:Such signs and symptoms require emergency medical attention. Treatment of ketotic hypoglycemia may include intravenous (IV) saltwater (saline) and sugar (dextrose) solutions.If your child is at risk of ketotic hypoglycemia, closely monitor his or her diet to make sure no meals or scheduled snacks are skipped. Recurrence is possible — typically during illness, when fasting is more common — but may be prevented with diet management. Most children ""outgrow"" ketotic hypoglycemia by ages 8 to 10 years."

		My 82-year-old husband has been on kidney dialysis for a year. He is not a good candidate for a kidney transplant. How will we know when dialysis is no longer working and should be discontinued?
	","
Kidney dialysis does some of the work of your kidneys when your kidneys are unable to do it themselves. This includes removing excess fluids and waste products from your blood, restoring electrolyte levels and helping to control your blood pressure.

To determine how well kidney dialysis is working, your husband's doctor can check his weight and blood pressure before and after each session. Regular blood tests, such as those measuring urea and creatinine levels, also help assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

Kidney dialysis is only part of your husband's treatment. He must also adjust to fluid and dietary restrictions and take medications. In addition, dialysis affects his time and schedule. Activities must be scheduled around the treatments. Dialysis may leave your husband feeling ""washed out."" Worsening health, depression and complications of dialysis may also affect how your husband feels about continuing treatment.

If the dialysis medical team doesn't periodically review your husband's overall situation, ask them to do so. These periodic reviews — which should include input from you and your husband — are important in determining how well the treatment is working.

If your husband is frustrated with a specific treatment or another medical problem, discuss it with his doctor. His doctor may be able to make some changes in the treatment that could improve his situation.

There may come a time when your husband feels he wants to stop kidney dialysis. Although he has the right to discontinue treatment, it's important to discuss the decision carefully with loved ones as well as your husband's treatment team.

		I'm considering kidney donation. Are there long-term risks?
	","
Research has shown that there's little long-term risk for kidney donation, provided you're carefully screened before becoming a donor. As a potential kidney donor, you'll receive a thorough medical exam to determine whether you're a good match for the potential recipient. And you'll be carefully checked to make sure you don't have any health problems that might be made worse by donating a kidney.

Kidney donation involves major surgery, and there are risks including bleeding and infection. After your kidney is removed (nephrectomy), you'll spend time recovering in the hospital and at home. With time, your remaining kidney will enlarge as it takes on additional blood flow and filtration of wastes.

Your long-term survival rate, quality of life, general health status and risk of kidney failure are about the same as that for people in the general population who aren't kidney donors. Regular checkups, including monitoring of your kidney function and blood pressure, generally are recommended to evaluate your health after kidney donation.

Is it true that having a kidney transplant increases the risk of cancer?,"Yes, having a kidney transplant increases your risk of cancer. Even before getting a transplant, just having end-stage kidney disease may slightly increase your risk of cancer.People who've received a kidney transplant or any other solid organ transplant, such as a liver, pancreas or heart, are more likely to develop cancer than are those who've not had a transplant. The long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs that prevent rejection of the transplanted organ appears to be a contributing factor. A suppressed immune system may permit abnormal cells — which are normally kept in check by your immune system — to become cancerous. It's unclear whether certain immunosuppressive drugs increase this risk more than others.Viruses, such as Epstein-Barr, play a role in some cancers in transplant recipients. Very rarely, a cancer may already be present in the transplanted organ, either as a primary or metastatic cancer.Skin cancers are the most frequent cancers in transplant recipients. For this reason, it's important to protect your skin from sun exposure after an organ transplant. You should also discuss with your doctor a schedule of cancer screenings appropriate to your specific circumstances.In general, the risk of developing a serious cancer is low compared with the many benefits of a successful kidney transplant when needed."
Is it OK for children to have caffeinated soda once in a while?,"Most pediatricians discourage caffeine consumption in kids. However, an occasional caffeinated beverage probably isn't harmful.Caffeine is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep and cause nervousness and irritability. Because of their small body size, children are more susceptible to these effects than adults are.One of the major sources of caffeine in children's diets is caffeinated soda. The main thing soda affects is the amount of calcium children get. In general, the more soda children drink, the less milk they drink and the less calcium they take in. Another thing to consider is that drinking carbonated soda — even when sugar-free — increases a child's risk of tooth decay.It's probably unrealistic to insist that your children never have caffeine. Caffeine is found in many foods, including chocolate. Instead, offer your children beverages that contribute to a well-balanced diet, such as milk and fruit or vegetable juice. Water is another excellent choice. Also, steer kids away from ""super-caffeinated"" beverages, which contain about three times the caffeine as regular soda."
My 8-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with Kohler's disease. Does this cause permanent bone damage?,"No. Kohler's disease is a rare bone disorder in which the navicular bone of the foot temporarily loses its blood supply (avascular necrosis). Fortunately, it causes no long-term bone damage.When the navicular bone loses its blood supply, the tissue in the bone dies and collapses. This can cause temporary pain and swelling in the middle of the foot, and limping. However these signs and symptoms improve within a few months as the navicular bone repairs itself and returns to normal.The exact cause of Kohler's disease — which most often affects children between the ages of 4 and 9 years — isn't known."

		What is kombucha tea? Does it have any health benefits?
	","
Kombucha tea is a fermented drink made with tea, sugar, bacteria and yeast. Although it's sometimes referred to as kombucha mushroom tea, kombucha is not a mushroom — it's a colony of bacteria and yeast. Kombucha tea is made by adding the colony to sugar and tea, and allowing the mix to ferment. The resulting liquid contains vinegar, B vitamins and a number of other chemical compounds. 

Health benefits attributed to kombucha tea include stimulating the immune system, preventing cancer, and improving digestion and liver function. However, there's no scientific evidence to support these health claims. 

There have, however, been reports of adverse effects such as stomach upset, infections and allergic reactions in kombucha tea drinkers. Kombucha tea is often brewed in homes under nonsterile conditions, making contamination likely. If ceramic pots are used for brewing, lead poisoning might be a concern — the acids in the tea may leach lead from the ceramic glaze. 

In short, there isn't good evidence that kombucha tea delivers on its health claims. At the same time, several cases of harm have been reported. Therefore, the prudent approach is to avoid kombucha tea until more definitive information is available.

What can you tell me about Krabbe's disease?,"Krabbe's disease is a rare, inherited and often fatal degenerative disorder of the nervous system caused by a defect in chromosome 14. Doctors may also refer to this disorder as globoid cell leukodystrophy. Children with Krabbe's disease have a deficiency of a specific enzyme, which leads to the destruction of myelin, a fatty substance that protects many nerves.Krabbe's disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern — which means both parents must carry the defective gene in order to pass the disease to their children. Infants with Krabbe's disease appear normal at birth. Signs and symptoms usually begin before the age of 1 year and include:A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of Krabbe's disease by:There's no cure for Krabbe's disease. Treatment typically is directed at minimizing the signs and symptoms. However, some children with Krabbe's disease may benefit from bone marrow transplant or umbilical-cord blood transfusion. The average life expectancy for infants diagnosed with this disorder is less than 2 years. If you have a family history of Krabbe's disease, you may want to consider genetic counseling."

		I've heard that LABAs can cause severe asthma attacks. Should I stop taking them?
	","
In some studies, long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) have been linked to life-threatening asthma attacks. The risk appears to be greatest when a LABA is used without also using an inhaled corticosteroid. In contrast, taking an inhaled corticosteroid along with a LABA is appropriate treatment for many people who have asthma. Don't stop any of your asthma medications before checking with your doctor first. 

LABAs are used on a regular schedule to open up narrowed airways and prevent asthma attacks. But because they increase the risk of having a life-threatening asthma attack, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that LABAs should never be used without an inhaled corticosteroid. So if you're taking a LABA without an inhaled corticosteroid, check with your doctor. 

LABAs include: 

A LABA should be taken with an inhaled corticosteroid, such as: 

One option is to take a single medication that combines both a LABA and a corticosteroid. There are two of these medications on the market: 

Children who need both a LABA and a corticosteroid should take them only as a combination medication, and not as separate medications. 

The benefits of LABAs to keep asthma under control generally outweigh the risks — if they're used as recommended. If you have any questions about your asthma medications, talk to your doctor. To be safe: 

LABAs are sometimes used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When used for COPD, LABAs don't have the same risks that are associated with asthma, so these warnings and recommendations don't apply.

		I'm having trouble sleeping lately. Does this increase my chances of getting sick?
	","
Yes, lack of sleep can affect your immune system. Studies show that people who don't get quality sleep or enough sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus, such as the common cold. Lack of sleep can also affect how fast you recover if you do get sick.

During sleep, your immune system releases proteins called cytokines, some of which help promote sleep. Certain cytokines need to increase when you have an infection or inflammation, or when you're under stress. Sleep deprivation may decrease production of these protective cytokines. In addition, infection-fighting antibodies and cells are reduced during periods when you don't get enough sleep. 

So, your body needs sleep to fight infectious diseases. Long-term lack of sleep also increases your risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease.

How much sleep do you need to bolster your immune system? The optimal amount of sleep for most adults is seven to eight hours of good sleep each night. Teenagers need nine to 10 hours of sleep. School-aged children may need 10 or more hours of sleep.

But more sleep isn't always better. For adults, sleeping more than nine to 10 hours a night may result in poor quality of sleep, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep.

		Is medication an option for lactation suppression immediately after childbirth?
	","
Medications for lactation suppression pose serious safety concerns. Injections of high doses of estrogen can stop milk production, for example, but the estrogen poses a risk of life-threatening blood clots. And bromocriptine (Parlodel), a drug once used for lactation suppression, isn't generally recommended for this purpose today because it poses a risk of heart attack and stroke — especially for women who developed high blood pressure during pregnancy.

If breast-feeding isn't possible or practical, the safest way to suppress lactation after childbirth is to let milk production dry up naturally. In the meantime, avoid stimulating the breasts or expressing milk. Over-the-counter pain relievers, ice packs and a supportive bra can help relieve breast engorgement and pain — which typically peaks during the first week after delivery.

		Can L-arginine supplements lower blood pressure?
	","
L-arginine (AHR-jih-nene) is a substance that's available in supplements, and is plentiful in foods such as nuts, red meat and dairy products. Some people take L-arginine because it can widen your arteries. It's thought that perhaps this widening might help lower your blood pressure. However, there's no evidence this is true. 

Your body usually makes all the L-arginine it needs, and taking a supplement is rarely necessary. 

L-arginine supplements can interact with some medications, including nitroglycerin and high blood pressure medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. People who have had cold sores or genital herpes also shouldn't take L-arginine supplements, because having too much L-arginine in your system can trigger the virus that causes those conditions. 

If you want to reduce your blood pressure, talk to your doctor about treatment options, including healthy lifestyle changes. If you have high blood pressure, talk to your doctor before starting any new herbal or nutritional supplements.

		What causes laryngospasm?
	","
Laryngospasm (luh-RING-go-spaz-um) is a brief spasm of the vocal cords that temporarily makes it difficult to speak or breathe. Often the cause can't be determined. But laryngospasm can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laryngospasm due to GERD occurs when stomach juices are pushed up your throat and make contact with your vocal cords, causing them to spasm. 

The symptoms of laryngospasm are often confused with those of asthma — a lung condition that can make breathing difficult. 

Laryngospasm happens suddenly and causes great difficulty breathing through the upper airways in your voice box (larynx). Laryngospasm also makes it difficult to speak. Though laryngospasm can be frightening, your vocal cords eventually relax without causing serious problems. 

There's no effective medication to relax the vocal cords more quickly. However, sitting down and trying to relax your whole body during an episode may speed recovery. 

If GERD is the cause of laryngospasm, treatment of GERD may reduce the number and severity of episodes.

		Does exercise late in the day cause insomnia?
	","
Regular exercise reduces stress and anxiety, and generally improves sleep. But for some people, exercising within five hours of bedtime may cause problems getting to sleep.

Keep in mind, everyone's different. For some people, late-day exercise isn't a problem. It may require some trial and error to see how working out affects the quality of your sleep. Without making any other changes that are likely to affect your sleep, take notes on how well you sleep after working out at different times. This can help you determine the time of day that's best for your workout and the least disruptive to your sleep.

		Are late-night snacks a no-no for people who have diabetes?
	","
If you have diabetes, late-night snacks aren't necessarily off-limits — but it's important to make wise choices. 

Late-night snacks add extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. And if you snack after your evening meal — especially if the foods contain carbohydrates — you may wake up the next morning with a high blood sugar level. 

If you're hungry after dinner, choose a ""free"" food, such as: 

Or swap the snack for a piece of gum or hard candy. These ""free"" foods have few, if any, carbohydrates and calories, so they won't contribute to weight gain or increased blood sugar. 

If you take insulin or other diabetes medications and must snack before bedtime to prevent low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night, talk to your doctor. He or she may adjust the dose of your medications to prevent the need for a late-night snack.

		Is there a medication to thicken eyelashes?
	","
Yes. The medication bimatoprost — marketed under the brand name Latisse — is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat inadequate eyelashes (hypotrichosis). Bimatoprost is also marketed under the brand name Lumigan, which is used in prescription eyedrops to treat glaucoma. Eyelash growth was an unexpected side effect of Lumigan, which led to the creation and marketing of Latisse. 

With regular applications along the lash line of the upper eyelid, Latisse gradually encourages growth of longer, thicker and darker eyelashes. Latisse isn't meant to be applied to the lower eyelid. For full results, you must use the medication daily for at least two months. Eyelash improvements remain as long as you continue to use the medication. When you stop using Latisse, your eyelashes will eventually return to their original appearance. 

Potential side effects of Latisse include: 

Although darkened eyelids might fade when the medication is stopped, any changes in iris color are likely to be permanent. 

In one small study of people who have eyelash loss due to alopecia areata — a medical condition that causes temporary hair loss — Latisse triggered moderate eyelash growth for more than 40 percent of participants. Research isn't conclusive, however. In another small study of people who have alopecia areata, Latisse wasn't an effective treatment for eyelash growth. 

If you're concerned about the appearance of your eyelashes, talk to your doctor. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of using an eyelash-growing medication.

		What causes leg cramps during pregnancy and can they be prevented?
	","
Leg cramps are painful involuntary muscle contractions that typically affect the calf, foot or both. Leg cramps during pregnancy are common, often striking at night during the second and third trimester. The exact cause of leg cramps during pregnancy isn't clear. However, some research suggests a connection between leg cramps and the buildup of lactic and pyruvic acids — byproducts of the metabolism of sugar and starch — which occurs as a result of impaired blood flow in the legs. 

To help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy: 

If a leg cramp strikes, stretch the calf muscle on the affected side. Walking or jiggling and then elevating your legs may help keep the leg cramp from returning. A hot shower, warm bath or ice massage also may help.

		Lately, I've had a lot of leg pain, especially when sitting at my desk or standing in line at the store. Should I be concerned about this new aching?
	","
New, persistent leg pain certainly warrants a visit to your doctor for evaluation. Leg pain can have many causes, but your description of aching after prolonged standing or sitting suggests a possible buildup of fluid in the leg veins (venous congestion).

Venous congestion occurs when the valves in your leg veins don't work properly to keep blood moving efficiently from your legs to your heart — a condition called venous insufficiency. Instead, blood pools in your legs and feet, causing pain and, frequently, swelling. People with venous congestion typically describe the pain as a burning or cramping sensation, mainly in the calf.

Past inflammation of a vein (phlebitis) may damage the valves and lead to venous congestion. Poor function of the valves in the leg veins also contributes to varicose veins — distended veins visible just beneath the skin. Varicose veins also may lead to venous congestion. 

Wearing knee-high support hose may be worth a try to ease discomfort associated with fluid buildup in the legs. Ask your doctor for a recommendation.

		I know lentils are supposed to be good for me. But what are they and how do I prepare them?
	","
Lentils are grouped with beans and peas as part of the legume family because, like all legumes, they grow in pods. Lentils are high in protein and fiber and low in fat, which makes them a healthy substitute for meat. They're also packed with folate, iron, phosphorus, potassium and fiber.

Lentils come in three main varieties: brown, green and red. Most grocery stores carry brown lentils, usually dried. Green and red lentils may be found at specialty food markets. Here are some tips for choosing your color:

Unlike other legumes, lentils cook quickly without pre-soaking. Just make sure to rinse away any dirt, dust or debris before adding them to recipes. Lentils work well in soups, stews and salads. Or you boil them for 15 to 30 minutes, add turmeric, ginger or other seasonings, and serve over rice or mix with other vegetables and enjoy.

		I'm taking Lexapro, and my breasts seem unusually tender to the touch. For women, do Lexapro side effects include breast tenderness?
	","
Escitalopram (Lexapro) is a prescription drug commonly used to treat depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Breast tenderness isn't among the published Lexapro side effects, but some studies and unofficial reports have linked Lexapro and breast tenderness. 

Lexapro may interfere with the normal processing of prolactin — a hormone that affects breast tissue. It's possible that this could lead to breast tenderness. Breast pain has been documented as a rare side effect of other antidepressants, including citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft), venlafaxine (Effexor) and mirtazapine (Remeron). Some medications other than antidepressants also have been linked to breast tenderness. 

Keep in mind, a number of other things can cause breast pain. Your doctor will consider any possible underlying causes for your symptoms. Your doctor may have you stop taking Lexapro for a period of time to see whether your breast tenderness improves. But don't change your dose or quit taking your antidepressant until you talk to your doctor. If your breast tenderness seems to be related to Lexapro, your doctor may recommend another antidepressant. In some cases, adding a medication specifically to relieve breast tenderness can help.

		Are liposuction alternatives a good way to get rid of body fat? I've tried diet and exercise but still have love handles.
	","
Because of their newness to the market, it's too soon to tell if liposuction alternatives are a good way to remove excess body fat or if they'll replace traditional liposuction. Liposuction alternatives are cosmetic techniques for body contouring and fat removal. Liposuction alternatives are touted as safer ways to eliminate unwanted pockets of body fat, like love handles, because they don't involve needles, surgery or anesthesia. 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two devices for the removal of specific areas of body fat: 

Other fat-busting devices are hoping to get FDA approval, too. 

There have been few clinical trials to test the effectiveness of liposuction alternatives, and the trials that have been conducted included only a few dozen participants. The results have been mixed, with some participants experiencing fat loss and others seeing no beneficial effects. 

Liposuction alternatives are said to have few side effects. Side effects with CoolSculpting can include temporary redness, minor bruising, tingling and numbness around treated areas. You may also feel intense cold during the procedure. Possible side effects with Zerona can include eye damage. Both devices also pose a risk of electric shock if not properly grounded. You can resume normal activities immediately after either procedure.

Liposuction alternatives aren't good options for everyone. They're meant for people who are generally fit but who have love handles or other pockets of fat that diet and exercise haven't eliminated. Liposuction alternatives are not for weight loss or large-scale fat reduction. They're used purely for cosmetic reasons. 

And keep in mind that even after successful use of a liposuction alternative, diet and exercise are important — you can gain weight after this kind of body sculpting, and you can develop unwanted fat in other areas of your body.

		I'd like to lose some weight, and I'm thinking about trying a diet pill called Lipovarin. Can you tell me if it really works?
	","
There's no evidence that Lipovarin — a popular, nonprescription diet pill — promotes weight loss. In fact, this product may actually pose serious health risks.

Lipovarin contains the ingredient synephrine, a constituent of bitter orange. Synephrine is a stimulant similar to ephedrine, which is found in the herb ephedra. Safety concerns led to the removal of ephedra products from the U.S. market. However, many manufacturers simply substituted synephrine in products that used to contain ephedra. These products, including Lipovarin, likely have the same serious health risks as ephedra products — including seizure, stroke and heart attack.

Remember, there are no shortcuts to permanent weight loss. The foundation of every successful weight-loss program is a healthy diet and regular physical activity.

Do chewable and liquid vitamins work faster or better than vitamin pills that you swallow?,"Liquids and chewable tablets typically are absorbed by the body quicker than capsules or tablets, which are swallowed.

		Is loss of sex drive normal as a man gets older?
	","
It's natural for men to notice a gradual decrease in sex drive (libido) as they age. The degree of this decline varies, and most men maintain at least some amount of sexual interest well into their 60s and 70s.

Sometimes, however, loss of sex drive is related to an underlying condition. For men, depression and stress often contribute to loss of sex drive. Sometimes the culprit is a decrease in male sex hormones due to an endocrine disorder. In other cases, loss of sex drive may be a medication side effect.

If you're concerned about loss of sex drive — especially if the loss happened abruptly — consult your doctor. He or she will likely do a physical exam and lab tests to help determine what's causing the loss of sex drive. Once any underlying factors are identified, your doctor can suggest appropriate treatment options. For example:

Some loss of taste and smell is natural with aging, especially after age 60. Various other factors also can contribute to loss of taste and smell, however, including: 

Loss of taste and smell can have a significant impact on quality of life, often leading to decreased appetite and poor nutrition. Sometimes loss of taste and smell contributes to depression. Loss of taste and smell also might tempt you to use excess salt or sugar on your food to enhance the taste — which could be a problem if you have high blood pressure or diabetes. 

If you're experiencing loss of taste and smell, consult your doctor. Although you can't reverse age-related loss of taste and smell, some causes of impaired taste and smell are treatable. For example, your doctor might adjust your medications if they're contributing to the problem. Many nasal and sinus conditions can be treated with medication or outpatient procedures. Likewise, dental problems are often treatable as well. If you smoke, quitting can help restore your sense of taste and smell. 

If necessary, your doctor might recommend consulting an allergist, otolaryngologist, neurologist or other specialist.

		What are the treatment options for low amniotic fluid during pregnancy?
	","
Few effective treatments exist for low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios).

During pregnancy, amniotic fluid provides a cushion that protects the baby from injury and allows room for growth, movement and development. Amniotic fluid also keeps the umbilical cord from being compressed between the baby and the uterine wall. In addition, the amount of amniotic fluid reflects the baby's urine output — which is an important measure of a baby's well-being.

Amniotic fluid normally decreases in the last weeks of pregnancy. Various factors can contribute to low amniotic fluid earlier in pregnancy, including:

If you're diagnosed with low amniotic fluid, your health care provider will carefully monitor your pregnancy to help prevent complications. He or she might recommend drinking more fluids — especially if you're dehydrated.

It's possible to temporarily increase the amount of amniotic fluid with a procedure known as amnioinfusion, in which saline is instilled into the amniotic sac. The effect is short-lived, however.

During prenatal care, amnioinfusion is usually done only to enhance ultrasound images. In this case, the saline is injected into the amniotic sac through a needle placed in the abdominal wall. Treatment will depend on what's detected through the ultrasound. Amnioinfusion might also be done during labor to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord. In this case, the saline is instilled into the amniotic sac through a catheter placed in the cervix. If the baby's heart rate drops too low or too often during labor or the umbilical cord is compressed, a C-section might be needed.

My doctor says I have a low sperm count. I don't understand why this would interfere with my ability to get my wife pregnant. Doesn't it take only one sperm to fertilize an egg?,"A low sperm count (oligospermia) is one cause of male infertility. Although it takes only a single sperm to fertilize an egg (ovum), the odds of a single sperm reaching the egg are very low.A normal sperm count is 20 million or more sperm per milliliter of semen. In order to father a child, at least 60 percent of those sperm should have a normal shape and show normal forward movement (motility). These numbers are a bit arbitrary because some men with lower sperm counts have fathered children. Likewise, some men with higher sperm counts have been unable to father children. Newer methods of artificial insemination can produce pregnancies when low sperm count is a factor.A medical evaluation can help determine the cause of a low sperm count. Most urologists are skilled in evaluating men with fertility problems and can recommend appropriate therapy when correctable conditions are encountered."

		Could a lower back tattoo keep me from having an epidural during labor?
	","
A lower back tattoo won't necessarily prevent you from having an epidural during labor. The exception would be if the tattoo is red, swollen or oozing fluid — or if the tattoo is recent and the affected skin is still healing. 

Research on tattoos and epidurals is limited. Theoretical concerns — such as the development of skin cancer in the affected area years later — remain controversial. Actual reports of problems associated with epidurals and lower back tattoos are exceedingly rare. 

If you have a lower back tattoo and decide to have an epidural during labor, the anesthesiologist will likely try to insert the needle through skin that isn't tattooed — such as an open area in the tattoo design.

If that isn't possible, the anesthesiologist might nick your skin before inserting the needle. This reduces any possible risk associated with trapping tattoo pigment inside the needle or depositing the pigment into deeper tissues. 

Keep in mind that placing a needle through the tattoo might result in a small scar that could alter the appearance of the tattoo.

If you're concerned about the unknowns associated with tattoos and epidurals, you might ask your health care provider about other options for pain relief during labor — such as relaxation exercises, breathing techniques, or oral or injected medications.

		Why is a low-phosphorus diet useful in managing kidney disease? What foods contain phosphorus?
	","
The kidneys help regulate the level of phosphorus in your blood. If your kidney function is impaired, eventually you'll likely have elevated phosphorus levels (hyperphosphatemia). In turn, the elevated phosphorus decreases the level of calcium in your blood, which can lead to bone disease. 

Often, 800 to 1,000 milligrams (mg) of phosphorus a day is the limit for someone who has kidney disease. Most healthy adults may eat double this amount. 

Nearly every food contains some phosphorus, so you can't eliminate all phosphorus from your diet. Generally foods high in protein (some meats, dairy products, beans, legumes, nuts and seeds) are higher in phosphorus. Therefore, unless you're receiving kidney dialysis, you'll be asked to eat smaller quantities of them. Whole grains also are higher in phosphorus, so choose refined ones. 

The following list may help you identify which foods to select. 

This chart is only a partial listing of suggestions for foods lower in phosphorus. Your needs may vary depending on your kidney function.

Manufacturers may use phosphorus-containing ingredients when processing foods to thicken, improve taste or prevent discoloration. Look at the ingredients list to see if phosphorus has been added and choose a similar food item that doesn't have such additives. Look for any ingredient that contains ""phos"" in the term. Dozens of additives contain phosphorus. Here are some examples:

Food manufacturers aren't required to list the amount of phosphorus in foods on food labels. For help creating a meal plan that meets your needs, consult a registered dietitian. He or she can help you make sure that you're getting adequate nutrition while following the dietary guidelines provided by your doctor.

Because it's difficult to lower phosphorus in your diet, your doctor may recommend a phosphate binder medication that can help control the amount of phosphorus your body absorbs from foods you eat. Your doctor may also recommend calcium and other supplements depending on your nutritional needs. Also, be sure to avoid medications and supplements that contain phosphorus.

		Why do processed foods contain so much sodium?
	","
Salt (sodium chloride) serves a number of purposes. It helps prevent spoiling by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, yeast and mold. Salt also brings out the flavors in food. For example, salt accentuates the sweetness in cakes and cookies. Salt also helps disguise metallic or chemical aftertastes in products such as soft drinks. In addition, salt reduces the perception of dryness in foods such as crackers and pretzels. But must processed foods contain so much salt? Many food and nutrition experts think not.

Many people eat far more sodium than they need — with processed foods contributing as much as 75 percent of the sodium in the typical American diet. 

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium to less than 2,300 mg a day — or 1,500 mg if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

To reduce the salt in your diet, try these tips:

I heard recently that doctors may be able to detect lung cancer by sniffing your breath. Is this for real?,"Several researchers are studying the use of a so-called ""sniff test"" or ""breath test"" to detect lung cancer at an earlier stage. These tests rely on certain volatile compounds made by tumor cells that can be detected in the breath. Research is ongoing to develop an electronic device to detect these chemicals. Other studies involve training dogs to detect these same chemicals. All of this work is highly experimental. At this time, it is unclear if any of these methods will ever be useful or practical in lung cancer diagnosis."

		Can lung nodules be cancerous?
	","
Most lung nodules are noncancerous (benign). However, some lung nodules may be cancerous — either early-stage lung cancer or metastatic cancer that has spread to the lungs from another site in the body. 

Lung nodules — small masses of tissue in the lung — are quite common. They appear as round, white shadows on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan. They're usually about .2 inch (5 millimeters) to 1 inch (25 mm) in size. A larger lung nodule, such as one that's 25 mm or larger, is more likely to be cancerous than is a smaller lung nodule. 

The most helpful thing your doctor can do is compare your current chest X-ray or CT scan with a previous one. If the nodule on earlier images hasn't changed in size, shape or appearance, it's probably noncancerous. Causes of noncancerous lung nodules include infections, such as histoplasmosis or tuberculosis, a small collection of normal cells (hamartoma), lung cysts, and vascular abnormalities. Noncancerous lung nodules usually require no treatment. However, your doctor will probably monitor the nodule for changes using periodic imaging tests. 

If a lung nodule is new or has changed in size, shape or appearance, your doctor may recommend further testing — such as a CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, bronchoscopy or tissue biopsy — to determine if it is cancerous. 

A CT scan is usually the first test if it's suspected that a nodule is malignant. If there is no evidence that the possible cancer has spread, then surgical removal may be recommended. If results of the CT scan are indeterminate, then the decision may be made to observe with follow-up imaging or a biopsy. If you have multiple lung nodules (two or more), especially if not in just one lung, your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan that's specific to your case.

		Can lupus cause hair loss?
	","
Unfortunately, yes. A majority of people with lupus experience some hair loss (alopecia, pronounced al-o-PE-she-uh), whether they have a form of lupus that affects several organs or a form that mainly affects the skin. Most of the time, though, lupus is unlikely to cause complete or permanent hair loss.

Hair loss may be an early sign of lupus, before the disease is diagnosed. Lupus causes widespread inflammation, almost always involving your skin — particularly, on your face and scalp. Because of this inflammation and other factors, the hair on your scalp may gradually thin out, although a few people lose clumps of hair instead. Loss of eyebrow, eyelash, beard and body hair is also possible.

Although lupus-related hair loss can be alarming, your hair is likely to grow back when your lupus is treated. The signs and symptoms of lupus often go into remission for long periods, but the disease tends to flare back up unpredictably. You may experience hair loss again if you have a lupus flare.

Some people with lupus develop a rash with round lesions (discoid rash) on the scalp. Because discoid lesions scar your hair follicles, they do cause permanent hair loss.

If your hair is falling out, consult your doctor to find out why. Unless you're already being treated for lupus or you have other signs and symptoms the disease, your hair loss probably has a different cause. Among the possibilities are medications, hormonal changes, thyroid disorders, nutritional deficiencies, stress and recent fever.

		Does lupus cause hives?
	","
Lupus can cause hives, but this is uncommon. The exact cause of hives in lupus isn't clear. But it may be due to certain antibodies produced by some people with lupus. Sun exposure also may play a role. In addition, some of the medications used to treat lupus may cause side effects that include hives.

Individual hives usually last less than 24 hours. Individual hives that last longer than 24 hours may be due to urticarial vasculitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin. Lupus is one cause of urticarial vasculitis.

		What causes enlarged red blood cells (macrocytosis)?
	","
Macrocytosis is a term used to describe red blood cells that are larger than normal. It typically causes no signs or symptoms and is usually detected incidentally on routine blood tests. 

Macrocytosis isn't a specific disease, but it may indicate an underlying problem that requires medical evaluation. Common causes of macrocytosis include: 

If you have macrocytosis, blood tests can help determine its cause. In some cases, it may be necessary to remove a sample of your bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside your bones — for testing (bone marrow biopsy and aspiration). 

Treatment of macrocytosis, if needed, is directed at the underlying cause. In the case of vitamin B-12 or folate deficiency, for instance, treatment may include diet modification and dietary supplements or injections. If macrocytosis is caused by severe anemia, a blood transfusion might be necessary.

		I have mouth sores from receiving chemotherapy. I've heard that something called ""magic mouthwash"" might help. What is it?
	","
Magic mouthwash is the term given to a solution used to treat mouth sores (oral mucositis). Oral mucositis can be extremely painful and can result in an inability to eat, speak or swallow. Magic mouthwash may be used to treat mouth sores that result from some forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 

There are several versions of magic mouthwash. Some are available pre-mixed (First-Mouthwash BLM, First-BXN Mouthwash, others), while others are prepared to order by pharmacists. If it's determined that magic mouthwash might be helpful, your doctor will likely write a prescription listing the ingredients and the amount of each. Magic mouthwash usually contains at least three of these basic ingredients: 

Most formulations of magic mouthwash are intended to be used every four to six hours, and to be held in your mouth for one to two minutes before being either spit out or swallowed. It's recommended that you don't eat or drink for 30 minutes after using magic mouthwash so that the medicine has time to produce an effect. 

It's unclear how effective magic mouthwash is in treating oral mucositis. That's because of the lack of standardization in the formulations of mouthwash, and poorly designed studies done to gather data. If you have mouth sores that cause you pain and discomfort, talk with your doctor. 

Side effects of magic mouthwash may include problems with taste, a burning or tingling sensation in the mouth, drowsiness, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea.

"Can magnet therapy relieve chronic pain? I have back pain, and I'm thinking about buying a magnetic mattress pad.","There's no definitive evidence that magnet therapy relieves pain. However, anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that some people do experience some pain relief from magnet therapy.Many theories have been proposed as to why magnet therapy may relieve pain. But none of these theories has been scientifically proved. Clinical trials involving magnet therapy have produced conflicting results. Some suggest effective pain relief from magnets, and others report no effect.The vast majority of magnets marketed to consumers to treat pain are of a type called static magnets, because the resulting magnetic fields are unchanging. The other magnets used for health purposes are called electromagnets, because they generate magnetic fields only when electrical current flows through them. Currently, electromagnets are used primarily under the supervision of a doctor or in clinical trials.Static magnets come in various strengths. Examples of products containing magnets include shoe insoles, heel inserts, mattress pads, belts and bracelets. Some of these products can be quite expensive.Additional, larger and higher quality studies are needed to determine what role, if any, magnet therapy may play in pain relief. In the meantime, it is reasonable to say that some people appear to get some benefit from magnet therapy — although this may be in part to a placebo effect. Also, no significant adverse effects have been reported with magnet therapy.Bottom line: You must decide how much money you want to spend on a treatment that may or may not help but probably won't do any harm."

		Can I get a yeast infection from my girlfriend? I thought only women got yeast infections.
	","
It's possible for a man to contract a genital yeast infection if he has unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner who has a genital yeast infection. However, just because your girlfriend has a yeast infection doesn't mean you will get one too. Sexual transmission of yeast infections is uncommon. 

Many people are under the impression that only women get genital yeast infections. Regardless of your sex, though, prolonged antibiotic use increases your risk of a yeast infection. Also, men and women with diabetes or impaired immune systems, such as those with HIV, are more susceptible to yeast infections. 

Signs and symptoms of a male yeast infection include a reddish rash, along with itching or burning at the tip of the penis. Fortunately, most male yeast infections are easily treated with an over-the-counter antifungal treatment, such as Monistat (yes, men can use it too). Apply the medication directly to the affected skin twice daily for a week. If the rash doesn't go away, or if it recurs frequently, consult your doctor. 

If you and your partner have symptoms of genital yeast infection, it's important that you both be treated. Otherwise, you may keep reinfecting each other. Also, it's generally recommended that you refrain from sexual contact until all signs and symptoms of the infection are gone.

So, you can safely use over-the-counter anti-fungal treatments such as Monistat — even though these products are labeled ""for vaginal use"" — to treat male yeast infections.

		Mammogram guidelines seem to differ about when to begin mammograms — at age 40 or at age 50. When should I start getting mammograms and how often should I have one?
	","
You're right that there are varying mammogram guidelines from different organizations about when to begin mammograms. Here's a brief summary. 

<strong>Differing mammogram guidelines<br/>
</strong>In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — a group of health experts that reviews published research and makes recommendations about preventive health care — issued revised mammogram guidelines. Those guidelines include the following: 

These guidelines differ from those of the American Cancer Society (ACS). The ACS mammogram guidelines call for yearly mammogram screening beginning at age 40 for women at average risk of breast cancer. Meantime, the ACS says the breast self-exam is optional in breast cancer screening. 

According to the USPSTF, women who have screening mammograms die of breast cancer less frequently than do women who don't get mammograms. However, the USPSTF says the benefits of screening mammograms don't outweigh the harms for women ages 40 to 49. Potential harms may include false-positive results that lead to unneeded breast biopsies and accompanying anxiety and distress. 

<strong>What Mayo Clinic recommends<br/>
</strong>At Mayo Clinic, the current practice is to continue to recommend an annual screening mammogram beginning at the age of 40, which aligns with the ACS recommendation. 

At Mayo Clinic, a three-tiered approach is used: 

Screening mammograms can detect breast abnormalities early in women in their 40s. Findings from a large study in Sweden of more than 1 million women in their 40s who received screening mammograms showed a decrease in breast cancer deaths by 29 percent. And it's important to remember that most women who get breast cancer have no family history or other known risk factors for the disease. 

Screening mammography is not a perfect exam. But it is the best available tool to detect cancer early, which can lead to better options and possibly less aggressive treatments. 

If you're concerned about screening mammograms, talk to your doctor and learn what's right for you based on your individual risks. It's important that the two of you work together to develop a screening plan.

		I've read that a mammogram is useless when it comes to detecting cancer in women with dense breasts. Is this true?
	","
Dense breasts can make mammograms more difficult to interpret. But this doesn't mean a mammogram is useless for detecting cancer or other breast abnormalities in women with dense breasts. 

Breast tissue is composed of fatty (nondense) tissue and connective (dense) tissue. The relative ratio of fatty tissue to connective tissue differs among women. As women age, their breasts tend to become less dense. 

Dense breast tissue appears as a solid white area on a mammogram, and fat appears as a dark area. Mammogram X-rays do not penetrate — or ""see through"" — dense tissues as well as they do through fat. So, in women with dense breasts, mammograms are more difficult to interpret. Tumors also are dense tissue and appear as solid white areas on the mammogram. This can make it more difficult to detect a tumor in dense breasts because it looks a lot like the dense tissue that surrounds it. 

Some studies have found that newer digital mammography does a better job detecting cancer in dense breasts than does mammography that uses film. A digital mammogram produces images on a computer screen that can be enhanced and magnified for closer viewing. 

Many, but not all, medical centers offer digital mammography. Ask your doctor for a referral to a center that offers this technology if you feel it's best for you.

		Can drinking mangosteen juice reduce arthritis inflammation and pain?
	","
It might. A number of laboratory and animal studies suggest that mangosteen has significant anti-inflammatory effects. And a few small-scale studies in humans indicate that the juice helps reduce blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is a substance associated with inflammation, which may be caused by widespread infection or disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. 

But the studies that found this reduction in CRP were not conducted with people who have arthritis. And not everybody who has arthritis has an elevation in CRP. So at this point, while the data appears promising, it is still too early to say for sure what role mangosteen juice has in treating arthritis symptoms.

Mangosteen is a tropical fruit native to Southeast Asia. Despite its name, mangosteen is not related to the mango. The mangosteen fruit is the size and shape of a tangerine, with a thick, dark rind and creamy flesh. Mangosteen is marketed as a supplement, both as a juice and in capsule form.

		I'd like to buy a treadmill. Would I get a better workout using a manual treadmill or a motorized treadmill?
	","
Treadmills are among the most popular exercise machines. A manual treadmill is likely to be less expensive than is a motorized treadmill. A manual treadmill is safer, too, because the belt stops moving when you stop moving. However, you'll probably get a better workout with a motorized treadmill than you would with a manual treadmill.

A manual treadmill is likely to have a smaller platform or belt than is a motorized treadmill, which can make it difficult to walk briskly — much less jog or run. Plus, it can be challenging to get the belt on a manual treadmill to move smoothly. This may leave you gripping the handrails while you exercise, which can lead to an inconsistent pace and a less effective workout.

Whether you're leaning toward a manual treadmill or the motorized variety, be sure to try the treadmill before you buy it. Testing the equipment yourself is the best way to determine whether it'll meet your needs.

		I just started taking MAOIs for depression. Do I really need to follow a low-tyramine diet?
	","
Tyramine is an amino acid that helps regulate blood pressure. It occurs naturally in the body and in certain foods. MAOIs block an enzyme called monoamine oxidase, which breaks down excess tyramine in the body. Blocking this enzyme helps with depression. But, tyramine can quickly reach dangerous levels if you eat high tyramine foods. Your body can't break them down quickly enough. This leads to a spike in blood pressure that may require emergency treatment. Signs and symptoms can include: 

Some foods high in tyramine include: 

The amount of tyramine can vary among foods due to different processing, storage and preparation methods. While you're taking MAOIs, your doctor may recommend eating only fresh foods — not leftovers or foods past their freshness dates. 

One MAOI inhibitor, selegiline (Emsam) is delivered with a patch you put on your skin. With selegiline, you may not need to be as strict with the foods you eat. 

Whichever type of MAOI you take, ask your doctor for a list of foods to avoid. Make sure you understand exactly what's safe for you and what isn't. Learn the emergency signs of high blood pressure and know what to do if you accidently eat or drink something with too much tyramine.

		I'm curious about marijuana and depression. Can marijuana cause depression?
	","
Some research suggests that marijuana smokers are diagnosed with depression more often than are nonsmokers — particularly regular or heavy marijuana users. However, it doesn't appear that marijuana directly causes depression. It's likely that the genetic, environmental or other factors that trigger depression also lead to using marijuana. For example, some people may use marijuana as a way to cope with depression symptoms. 

There are also links between marijuana and other mental health conditions. Marijuana use may trigger schizophrenia or detachment from reality (psychosis) in certain people. There is also some evidence that adolescents who attempt suicide may be more likely to use marijuana than those who don't. As with marijuana use and depression, more research is needed to better understand these associations.

The bottom line: Marijuana use and depression accompany each other more often than you might expect by chance, but there's no clear evidence that marijuana directly causes depression.

"I've had a mastectomy, and I'm wondering if I can have blood pressure readings taken on the arm affected by surgery?","It depends on the type of mastectomy you've had. At one time, the only breast cancer surgery was radical mastectomy — in which the surgeon removed the breast, the underlying chest muscles and all of the lymph nodes under the arm. In such cases, arm swelling (lymphedema) was a serious concern. Women who had radical mastectomies were warned to avoid constriction of the affected arm to prevent lymphedema.Treatment of breast cancer now typically involves a modified mastectomy, which removes only the sentinel lymph nodes — those closest to the cancer. Lymphedema of the arm is uncommon in women who have had this type of surgery. If swelling does occur, it's typically mild and short-term, resolving within a year after surgery. As a result, constriction of the arm is unlikely to cause swelling.If you have only had your sentinel nodes removed, it is safe to have blood pressure readings taken — as well as blood drawn — on the side of the surgery. However, it's better to use the unaffected arm when possible."

The average age of study participants was 76. None of the participants had Alzheimer's disease at the start of the study. By the end of the study, 260 participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.Over the course of the study, researchers evaluated how closely participants followed a published definition of the Mediterranean diet. Participants who stuck most closely to the diet were less likely to develop Alzheimer's than were participants who didn't follow the diet.Although this is an intriguing finding, more research is needed to evaluate the potential effects of diet and lifestyle on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. An equally valid interpretation of the findings would be that people who had difficulty following a diet plan are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and that also makes some sense."

The hormone melatonin helps control your natural sleep-wake cycle. Natural levels of melatonin in the blood are highest at night. Some research suggests that melatonin supplements might be helpful in treating jet lag or reducing the time it takes to fall asleep — although the effect is typically mild. Melatonin might be more effective for other types of sleep issues, such as delayed sleep disorder or sleep disorders affecting circadian rhythm. 

The most common melatonin side effects include: 

Other, less common melatonin side effects might include abdominal discomfort, mild anxiety, irritability, confusion and short-lasting feelings of depression. 

In addition, melatonin supplements can interact with various medications, including: 

If you're considering taking melatonin supplements, check with your doctor first — especially if you have any health conditions. The correct dose depends on the intended use. For example, circadian rhythm sleep disorders are often treated with 0.5 milligrams of melatonin a day, while doses of 3 to 5 milligrams a day might be used to treat jet lag or reduce the time it takes to fall asleep. In addition, remember that melatonin is generally recommended only for short-term use — up to two months. Some research indicates that longer term use might be appropriate in certain cases, however. 

If you take melatonin, choose commercial supplements produced in a lab. Melatonin supplements made from animal sources might contain various contaminants. Don't engage in activities that require alertness — such as driving or operating heavy machinery — for four to five hours after taking melatonin.

		Is there a connection between menopause and high blood pressure?
	","
Blood pressure generally increases after menopause. Some doctors think this increase suggests that the hormonal changes of menopause may play a role in high blood pressure. Others think an increase in body mass index (BMI) in menopausal women may play a greater role than hormonal changes. 

Menopause-related hormonal changes can lead to weight gain and make your blood pressure more reactive to salt in your diet — which, in turn, can lead to higher blood pressure. For some women, hormone therapy (HT) for menopause also may contribute to increases in blood pressure. 

To control your blood pressure both before and after menopause, focus on a healthy lifestyle: 

If necessary, your doctor may prescribe medication to help lower your blood pressure.

		What can you tell me about the menstrual cup?
	","
A menstrual cup is a bell-shaped device worn inside the vagina during menstruation to collect menstrual fluid. Menstrual cups provide a viable alternative to pads and tampons. 

Menstrual cups are typically made of silicone or other nonlatex materials. Some menstrual cups are reusable — either one cup for an entire menstrual period or one cup for many menstrual periods — while others are intended for one-time use. Examples include The DivaCup, The Moon Cup and Softcup. 

During your period, you insert the menstrual cup into your vagina. If you're using a reusable menstrual cup, you empty the cup when it's full, wash it and then place it back in your vagina. If you're using a disposable menstrual cup, you discard it when it's full and replace it with another cup. How often you need to empty or replace the menstrual cup depends on the size of the cup and your menstrual flow. Generally, a menstrual cup can be worn about twice as long as a tampon — up to eight to 12 hours at a time. 

A menstrual cup can be left in place during urination or a bowel movement. Some menstrual cups can be worn during sex, while others must be removed first. 

Menstrual cups don't offer protection from pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. Check with your doctor before using a menstrual cup if you use an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control or you've experienced toxic shock syndrome. 

Menstrual cups are available over-the-counter in pharmacies. Menstrual cups can also be purchased online. If you decide to try a menstrual cup, read and follow the product directions carefully.

		I'd like to lose a few pounds. What's the best way to boost my metabolism?
	","
Trying to boost your metabolism probably won't lead to weight loss, at least not to the degree that changing your diet and lifestyle habits will. How much you weigh really depends on the number of calories you eat and how much physical activity you get. 

Only rarely is excessive weight gain caused by a medical problem that slows metabolism, such as Cushing's syndrome or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).

So focus on the factors you have control over. These can help you manage your weight and possibly improve your metabolism.

If you're concerned about your weight or you think your metabolism is too slow, talk with your doctor. Your doctor can check for medical causes and help you adopt healthy lifestyle changes to help your weight loss.

Sometimes I get menstrual-like cramps and breast tenderness in the middle of my cycle. What causes this?,"The midcycle menstrual cramps you describe may be a common, usually harmless condition called mittelschmerz — pain during ovulation.Prior to ovulation, the ovary is stretched by the developing follicle. When ovulation occurs, the ovary releases a small amount of fluid — along with the egg — into the abdomen. The fallopian tube takes up the egg but not the fluid. This fluid in the abdomen may irritate the lining of the pelvis (peritoneum) and cause abdominal discomfort — similar to menstrual cramps — in some women. The stretching of the ovary before ovulation may also cause discomfort.The breast tenderness you describe is probably due to the rise in estrogen, which occurs right before ovulation.A doctor may diagnose mittelschmerz based on the timing and location of the pain. Mittelschmerz usually doesn't require medical attention and isn't caused by a serious underlying condition. Treatment may include over-the-counter pain medications.If midcycle pain is severe or accompanied by nausea or fever or if it lasts more than two days, consult your doctor."

		What are the health risks associated with taking migraine medications and antidepressants at the same time?
	","
Research suggests that combining migraine medications called triptans with certain antidepressants — including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — may increase the risk of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome.

Serotonin syndrome occurs when your body has too much serotonin — a chemical found in your nervous system. Triptans, SSRIs and SNRIs naturally raise serotonin levels. When these medications are taken together, the effect may be more pronounced. Fortunately, serotonin syndrome appears to be rare in people who are taking triptans and antidepressant medications. 

Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur quickly — within minutes to hours — and may include:

If you experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome, seek immediate medical attention. Left untreated, serotonin syndrome may be fatal.

There may be a less serious risk of interactions between other antidepressants and migraine medications. Antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can cause an increase in the level of triptans in your blood. SSRIs and MAOIs should also be used sparingly with migraine medications called ergotamines, because these antidepressants can slow the speed at which ergotamines break down.

If you're taking migraine medications and antidepressants, talk to your doctor — especially if you notice any changes in your health. Don't stop or change the dosages of any of your medications on your own.

		My doctor prescribed an antidepressant for my migraines. Is this an appropriate migraine treatment? I don't have depression.
	","
Certain antidepressants can help reduce the frequency and severity of some types of headaches, including migraines. You don't have to have depression to benefit from these drugs.

Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are most effective and likely work by affecting the level of serotonin and other chemicals in your brain. There is little evidence that other classes of antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are effective for migraine prevention. However, preliminary research suggests that one SNRI, venlafaxine (Effexor), may be helpful in preventing migraines.

Side effects of antidepressants vary from one medication to another and from person to person, but they can include weight gain, fatigue, constipation and dry mouth. Such side effects can make it difficult to stick with treatment. 

If the medication doesn't seem to be working or is causing bothersome side effects, discuss this with your doctor. Don't stop taking a prescribed medication without talking to your doctor first.

		Is there any link between migraine headaches and gastrointestinal problems?
	","
There can be. Nausea and vomiting are common with migraine attacks. And in younger children, recurrent bouts of vomiting (cyclical vomiting) or abdominal pain (abdominal migraine) — referred to as childhood periodic syndromes — also are associated with migraine headaches. Although childhood periodic syndromes usually aren't accompanied by migraine head pain, they're considered a form of migraine. In many cases, childhood periodic syndromes evolve into more-typical migraine headaches later in life. 

A 2007 study from Norway examined the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and migraine. The study showed a higher prevalence of headaches among people who regularly experience gastrointestinal symptoms — such as reflux, diarrhea, constipation and nausea — compared with those who do not. Results of this study suggest that people who get frequent headaches may be predisposed to gastrointestinal problems. However, more research is needed to understand the connection. 

If you experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhea with your headaches, talk to your doctor about treatment options. Treating the headache usually relieves gastrointestinal symptoms. However, in some cases, an anti-nausea or anti-diarrheal medication may be recommended. Keep in mind that some pain medications such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen may increase nausea.

A small number of women — approximately 4 percent to 8 percent — experience worsening of migraine headaches in pregnancy.No large studies have examined the course of migraines that first occur in pregnancy. Whether or not migraines continue after delivery (postpartum) depends on the individual. You and your doctor will simply have to wait and see. If your migraines do recur postpartum, treatment may include pain relievers or medications to reduce or prevent migraines.

		I've heard antidepressants don't work for mild depression. Is that true?
	","
Antidepressants don't work for everyone. For some people with mild depression, antidepressants seem to have little effect. However, for people with more severe depression, antidepressants often make a big difference. 

Although antidepressants generally aren't as effective for mild depression, that doesn't mean that they never help. Depression affects each person differently, and each person responds to medications differently. Finding the right medication may take some trial and error. 

If an antidepressant seems to ease your symptoms, it may be a good treatment choice for you. If you're taking an antidepressant, don't stop taking it without talking to your doctor. 

For many people with mild depression, talk therapy (also called psychotherapy or psychological counseling) appears to be an effective treatment. Some people benefit from a combination of talk therapy and medications. Lifestyle changes — such as stress reduction and regular exercise — also can make a difference. 

If you have signs and symptoms of depression, don't ignore them. Even mild depression can take a toll on your enjoyment of life, your performance at work or school, and your relationships with other people. And, left untreated, depression can get worse. Explore your treatment options with your doctor or mental health provider to figure out what's likely to work best to help you feel better again.

		How is milnacipran, the new fibromyalgia drug, different from other fibromyalgia medications?
	","
Milnacipran, marketed under the brand name Savella in the United States, is the latest drug to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the management of fibromyalgia. The FDA approved fibromyalgia indications for two other drugs — pregabalin (Lyrica) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) — in 2007 and 2008, respectively. 

Outside the United States, milnacipran already has a track record as an antidepressant.

It is similar to duloxetine in that both drugs increase the supply of serotonin and norepinephrine (chemical messengers, also known as neurotransmitters) available to your brain. The difference is that milnacipran gives your brain a larger boost in norepinephrine. Neuroscientists refer to this property of milnacipran as ""norepinephrine selectivity."" 

Many studies have demonstrated that pain receptors tend to be hypersensitive in people with fibromyalgia. By exerting a stronger effect on norepinephrine than on serotonin, milnacipran may scale back the brain's exaggerated reaction to neurochemicals associated with painful sensations. 

In clinical trials, milnacipran was significantly better than was a placebo at reducing pain and other physical symptoms in study participants who had fibromyalgia and did not also have depression or anxiety.

Studies are under way to determine whether milnacipran may also improve sleep disturbances common to fibromyalgia. Upcoming clinical trials may determine whether milnacipran can be safely and effectively given in combination with other fibromyalgia medications.

If your doctor prescribes milnacipran for your fibromyalgia symptoms, you'll typically start with a low dose. Then, under your doctor's guidance, you can gradually work up to 100 milligrams (mg) a day, usually in two separate 50 mg doses. In some cases, the dose can be increased to 200 mg a day.

My 18-year-old daughter has been diagnosed with minimal change kidney disease. What can you tell me about this condition?,"Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by swelling of the skin around the eyes, feet and hands and by high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria), low levels of protein in the blood and high cholesterol. Nephrotic syndrome results from damage to the small blood vessels (glomeruli) in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis).Minimal change disease is so named because the kidney tissue appears normal or nearly normal under a microscope. The cause of kidney damage typically can't be determined.A doctor may confirm a diagnosis of minimal change disease by a kidney biopsy and examination of kidney tissue with an electron microscope, which provides greater magnification than does a standard light microscope.Treatment of minimal change disease may include:In young children, proteinuria often goes away within four weeks of starting prednisone. But in older children, it may take longer. If steroid treatment is ineffective, your child's doctor may recommend further testing before changing medications."

		How is a ""ministroke"" different from a regular stroke?
	","
When people use the term ""ministroke,"" what they're really referring to is a transient ischemic attack (TIA) — a temporary interruption of blood flow to part of the brain. The symptoms of a TIA are similar to those of a stroke, but a TIA doesn't destroy brain cells or cause permanent disability. However, TIAs may recur and each TIA increases the risk of a subsequent stroke.

If you suspect that you've had a TIA, seek immediate medical attention. You may need various diagnostic tests — such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerized tomography (CT) scan — to help determine what caused the TIA. Depending on the underlying cause, you may need medication to prevent blood clots or a procedure to remove fatty deposits from the arteries that supply blood to your brain.

		Can mitral valve prolapse cause the aorta to thicken?
	","
Mitral valve prolapse doesn't cause the aorta to thicken. The aorta is the large blood vessel that branches off the heart to deliver oxygen-rich blood to the body. In some cases, however, people who have mitral valve prolapse may have problems with their aorta that are unrelated to mitral valve prolapse. This is especially likely if a person has Marfan syndrome or another connective tissue disorder. 

Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart disorder that occurs when the valve between the heart's left upper chamber (left atrium) and the left lower chamber (left ventricle) doesn't close properly. Mitral valve prolapse is often harmless. Most people who have mitral valve prolapse don't require treatment. If leakage is severe, however, the mitral valve may need to be repaired or replaced.

		If a piece of cheese has mold growing on it, should I throw the cheese away?
	","
Soft cheeses, such as cottage cheese, cream cheese and ricotta cheese, that have mold should be discarded. The same goes for any kind of cheese that's shredded, crumbled or sliced.

With these cheeses, the mold can send threads throughout the cheese. In addition, harmful bacteria, such as listeria, brucella, salmonella and E. coli, can grow along with the mold.

Mold generally can't penetrate far into hard and semisoft cheeses, such as cheddar, colby, Parmesan and Swiss. So you can cut away the moldy part and eat the rest of the cheese. Cut off at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) around and below the moldy spot. Be sure to keep the knife out of the mold so it doesn't contaminate other parts of the cheese.

Of course, not all molds pose a risk. In fact, some types of mold are used to make cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert. These molds are safe to eat.

If you're not sure what type of cheese you have or what to do if it grows mold, the safe course is to discard it.

		What's the connection between mononucleosis and Epstein-Barr virus?

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a widespread human herpes virus, can cause mononucleosis — but usually, it doesn't. In fact, most EBV infections aren't noticeable, even when they're most active in your body. By age 35, almost everyone has antibodies to EBV, indicating past infection. 

It takes more than an uncovered cough or sneeze to transmit EBV. During primary infection, people shed the virus in saliva. You need close contact, such as kissing or sharing a cup with an infected person, to catch EBV. 

The infection generally causes no signs or symptoms, except in teenagers and young adults. In that age group, up to half of EBV infections cause mononucleosis — a disease that features fatigue, headache, fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes.

		Can mononucleosis recur? I thought that once you got mono you couldn't get it again.
	","
Most people who have infectious mononucleosis, or mono, get it only once. Rarely, however, mononucleosis symptoms may recur months or even years later. 

Most cases of mononucleosis are caused by infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you're infected with EBV, you carry the virus — usually in a dormant state — for the rest of your life. Periodically, however, the virus may reactivate. When this happens, the virus can be detected in your saliva — but you're not likely to become ill. Rarely, reactivated EBV may cause illness in people who have weak immune systems, such as those who have AIDS. 

Mononucleosis sometimes leads to a serious condition called chronic active EBV infection, which is characterized by persistent illness more than six months after the initial mononucleosis diagnosis. 

If you're experiencing signs or symptoms of mononucleosis — such as fatigue, weakness, fever, sore throat, loss of appetite and swollen lymph nodes — and you've had mono before, consult your doctor to determine the cause of your current symptoms. Keep in mind that many other conditions, such as hepatitis and toxoplasmosis, can mimic the symptoms of mononucleosis.

		I'm scheduled for an MRI and I have kidney problems. Will I be OK having an MRI?
	","
It depends on the type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan you're scheduled to have — an MRI with contrast or an MRI without contrast. Contrast agents, including gadolinium, are used to enhance some MRI scans. Contrast agents are injected into a vein in your hand or arm. Not all MRIs require a contrast agent.

There are no special concerns for people with kidney problems having an MRI without contrast.

However, there are concerns if people with kidney problems are given a gadolinium-based contrast agent during their MRI — especially if they have severe kidney failure (renal insufficiency).

Gadolinium-containing contrast agents may increase the risk of a rare, but serious, disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in people with severe kidney failure. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis triggers thickening of the skin, organs and other tissues. There's no effective treatment for this serious, debilitating disease.

Before you have an MRI, ask your doctor if a gadolinium-based contrast agent will be used. If the answer is yes, tell your doctor about your history of kidney problems. If possible, your doctor may select a different imaging test. In cases where an MRI with gadolinium is necessary despite the potential risks, your doctor may use the lowest possible dose of the form of gadolinium that has been associated with the fewest complications as well as consider hemodialysis immediately after the MRI with gadolinium.

		Are there any adverse effects from long-term use of MSM for arthritis pain?
	","
Few studies have examined the long-term effects of the dietary supplement called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is formed by oxygenation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), an organic form of sulfur also used as a dietary supplement. Animals observed for 90 days on a daily dose of MSM five to seven times greater than that typically used in people had no serious problems. Stomach upset, diarrhea and headache have been reported in human trials of MSM lasting up to 12 weeks.

Given the lack of data about the long-term safety of the supplement, it's no surprise that its efficacy is also unproven. According to a review of studies involving people treated for spinal arthritis with glucosamine, chondroitin or MSM, no MSM studies published between 1984 and 2009 were conducted carefully enough for useful statistical analysis. An earlier review of studies testing MSM for arthritis in any joint found two small trials suggesting that the supplement may be helpful for knee arthritis.

MUFAs are monounsaturated fatty acids. MUFAs are considered a healthy type of fat. If your diet includes unsaturated fats such as MUFAs (and polyunsaturated fats) instead of saturated fats and trans fats, you may gain certain health benefits.

Consuming monounsaturated fatty acids may help lower your risk of heart disease by improving risk factors. For instance, MUFAs may lower your total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels but maintain or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. MUFAs may also help normalize blood clotting. And some research shows that MUFAs may also benefit insulin levels and blood sugar control, which can be especially helpful if you have type 2 diabetes.

MUFAs are a central part of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet. But even if you don't follow a Mediterranean-style diet, you can include more of these MUFA-rich foods in your diet:

Multigrain and whole grain are not interchangeable terms. Whole grain means that all parts of the grain kernel — the bran, germ and endosperm — are used. In contrast, multigrain means that a food contains more than one type of grain, although none of them may necessarily be whole grains. The same goes for other variations, such as ""seven-grain."" 

Whole-grain foods are a healthy choice because they contain nutrients, fiber and other healthy plant compounds found naturally in the grain. Look for products that list the first ingredient as ""whole wheat,"" ""whole oats"" or a similar whole grain. While ""whole grains"" may signify one of many types of healthy grains, ""whole wheat"" labels the specific grain used.

To determine whether these two drugs used in combination may provide a greater benefit than either drug used alone, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study is under way. The study — which addresses the safety as well as the effectiveness of the drug combination — began in 2005. Results are expected in 2012.

		Is there any connection between multiple sclerosis and epilepsy?
	","
Epileptic seizures appear to be three to six times more prevalent in those who have multiple sclerosis (MS) than in the general population (those who don't have MS). 

The cause of seizures in people with multiple sclerosis isn't completely understood. In these individuals, seizures most likely result from lesions present in the cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. However, other factors may play a role — especially since such lesions are very common and seizures are unusual in multiple sclerosis. 

Seizures have been observed before and presumably marking the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis, and during acute bouts of MS. In some cases, seizures appear to be the only sign of a flare of MS, but the majority of seizures occur unrelated to such MS relapses. Currently there isn't general acceptance of seizures as the first and only sign of MS. 

Most seizures can be controlled with anti-seizure medication.

While many young children are picky eaters, that doesn't necessarily mean that they have nutritional deficiencies. Many common foods — including breakfast cereal, milk and orange juice — are fortified with important nutrients, such as B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium and iron. So your child may be getting more vitamins and minerals than you think.

Furthermore, multivitamins aren't without some risks. Megadoses of vitamins and minerals can be toxic. In addition, some vitamins and minerals can interact with medications your child may take. 

Talk with your child's doctor if you're concerned about whether your child is getting the recommended level of vitamins and minerals. A multivitamin might be helpful for your child if he or she:

If your child's doctor recommends a multivitamin, choose one that is designed for your child's age group and doesn't provide more than 100 percent of the Daily Value of vitamins and minerals. In addition, keep multivitamins out of your child's reach and make it clear that they aren't candy.

What can you tell me about Munchausen syndrome?,"Munchausen syndrome is a rare but serious condition in which a person tries to appear sick or injured in order to get attention. Doctors may also refer to this as factitious disorder. People with Munchausen syndrome may even cause actual injury or illness that requires medical attention. This is a poorly understood disorder.Munchausen syndrome shouldn't be confused with hypochondria. People with hypochondria really believe they're sick. People with Munchausen syndrome know they're not sick but try to make it appear as if they are.Munchausen syndrome usually starts in early adulthood — often after a hospitalization for a medical condition or mental disorder. Rarely, a person may have a single episode of this disorder. In most cases, the behavior recurs off and on for decades.Most people with Munchausen syndrome are very secretive about their condition. They often have real medical problems that are self-inflicted. For example, a person who doesn't have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) injects insulin to cause low blood sugar. People with this disorder often seek physical exams, hospitalization and medical tests, and even accept painful treatment, including surgery.The disorder is difficult to diagnose. It often accompanies other psychiatric problems such as:Treatment is based on careful assessment of the person's medical and psychiatric symptoms. Any real medical problems are treated. It's important to search for the reasons behind the person's need to appear sick."

What should I do?","One of the best things you can do when a friend tells you she has an eating disorder is to make time to talk to her — when and where you know you won't be interrupted. Try to understand what she means when she says she is bulimic because this can mean different things to different people.Ask your friend how things are going in her life and if there are stressful situations that seem difficult to handle. This is especially important if she feels alone or unable to talk to others about what is bothering her. Being a good listener can go a long way to helping a friend. Reassure her that she's not alone and that many others have had this problem.Try to encourage your friend to talk with a responsible adult, such as a parent or other family member. If you want, you can offer to be there when she talks to this person for support.Professional help is important and can help someone to overcome this problem. As a friend, you can encourage her to work with a therapist who is an expert in this area."

		What can you tell me about myofascial release therapy as a treatment for back pain? Does it work?
	","
Myofascial (mi-oh-FASH-al) release is a manual therapy technique often used in massage. The technique focuses on pain believed to arise from myofascial tissues — the tough membranes that wrap, connect and support your muscles. Theoretically, myofascial pain differs from other types of pain because it originates in ""trigger points,"" which are related to stiff, anchored areas within the myofascia. The pain that a trigger point causes is often difficult to localize, though. 

During myofascial release therapy, the therapist locates myofascial areas that feel stiff and fixed instead of elastic and movable under light manual pressure. These areas, though not always near what feels like the source of pain, are thought to restrict muscle and joint movements, contributing to widespread muscle pain. The focused manual pressure and stretching used in myofascial release therapy loosen up restricted movement, leading indirectly to reduced pain. 

Many studies have found that massage, chiropractic manipulation and similar manual therapies work as well as other treatments for back pain. Few studies, however, have tested myofascial release therapy specifically, partly because the exact elements of myofascial release therapy vary from therapist to therapist. 

If you've been told that myofascial release therapy may be helpful for your back pain, consult a therapist who has training in the technique.

		Does nail biting cause any long-term nail damage?
	","
Although unsanitary, nail biting isn't likely to cause long-term nail damage. Nails are formed at the nail bed — where the U-shaped cuticles begin. As long as the nail bed remains intact, nail biting isn't likely to interfere with fingernail growth. In fact, some research suggests that nail biting might even promote faster nail growth. 

Nail biting isn't without risks, however. For example, nail biting can: 

In addition, compulsive nail biting is sometimes a sign of an underlying mental health condition, such as anxiety or an impulse control disorder.

		Are vertical nail ridges in fingernails cause for concern?
	","
Vertical nail ridges are fairly common and nothing to worry about. 

Vertical nail ridges extend from the cuticle to the tip of the nail. Vertical nail ridges often become more numerous or prominent with age, possibly due to variations in cell turnover within the nail. 

If your fingernails change color or you develop horizontal nail ridges, consult your doctor. These changes could indicate an underlying health condition.

Narrow stools that occur on an infrequent basis are probably not an indication of a serious underlying problem. However in some cases, narrow stools — especially if pencil thin — may be a sign of narrowing or obstruction of the colon due to colon cancer. In addition, irritable bowel syndrome may cause irregular stools that alternate between normal and either constipation or diarrhea. Such stools may also be narrower than usual. 

Check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your bowel habits — such as narrower than normal stools — that last longer than two weeks. Consult your doctor immediately if your bowel changes are accompanied by rectal bleeding or severe abdominal pain.

		I use an over-the-counter nasal spray for congestion associated with allergies. Should I be concerned about nasal spray addiction?
	","
What you may be referring to is a rebound effect that can occur if you use over-the-counter nasal decongestant sprays regularly. After a few days of using this type of nasal spray, your nose may become less responsive to the effects of the medication. 

As a result, you may need to use more and more of the medication to control congestion or your congestion may worsen if you stop using the medication. Some people may mistake this rebound effect for ""addiction,"" but it isn't. 

True addiction is a compulsive physiological need for and use of a habit-forming substance known to be physically, psychologically or socially harmful. Over-the-counter nasal sprays don't cause the physiological cravings that mark an addiction. 

To prevent rebound congestion, use over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays for no more than five days in a row, with as few doses as possible each day. Prescription nasal sprays containing steroids don't cause this rebound effect, so they can be used on a daily basis for years.

		Do natural aphrodisiacs actually work?
	","
There's little evidence to support the effectiveness of most substances thought of as natural aphrodisiacs. 

Although certain foods and supplements — such as chocolate, spicy food and saw palmetto — are sometimes claimed to affect libido, research has shown them to be largely ineffective at producing a sexual response in either men or women. 

While there's no harm in experimenting with most foods to see if they're effective natural aphrodisiacs, be aware that some supplements containing insect or plant extracts can be toxic. For example, Spanish fly, a commonly touted natural aphrodisiac, can cause kidney damage and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Certain products marketed as natural aphrodisiacs have also been found to contain prescription drug ingredients — such as sildenafil, the active ingredient in the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra — that aren't disclosed on the label. These ingredients can be dangerous if you have certain medical conditions or you're taking particular medications. 

If you're looking for an effective way to increase your sexual desire, consult your doctor. He or she may suggest proven strategies for enhancing sexual health, such as communicating with your partner, making healthy lifestyle choices and treating any underlying medical conditions. It may also help to consult a counselor or therapist who specializes in sexual concerns and relationship issues.

		Is nausea during pregnancy a good sign?
	","
Nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy, also called morning sickness, can be signs of a healthy pregnancy. A recent study of more than 2,400 pregnant women associated nausea and vomiting during the first trimester with a reduced risk of early pregnancy loss — particularly for women age 30 and older.

Shortly after a fertilized egg attaches to your uterine lining, your body begins to produce a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). While the cause of nausea during pregnancy isn't clear, nausea typically begins when production of HCG begins. As a result, nausea during pregnancy might indicate that you're experiencing the normal climb in pregnancy hormones needed for a healthy pregnancy.

Other theories suggest that nausea during pregnancy might:

A lack of nausea during pregnancy, however, isn't necessarily a cause for concern. Some women simply might be immune to the effects of pregnancy hormones. In addition, nausea can sometimes signal a problem. For instance, severe nausea and vomiting can indicate a molar pregnancy — when the placenta develops into an abnormal mass of cysts rather than becoming a viable pregnancy — or hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that causes you to lose weight and body fluids and might require treatment with intravenous fluids and medications.

If you're concerned about morning sickness or wonder whether your morning sickness is normal, consult your health care provider.

		Is a child's neck size a better way to gauge childhood obesity than body mass index (BMI)?
	","
Measuring a child's neck size is a relatively new method of screening for childhood obesity that's accurate and easier to obtain than BMI. Although the technique isn't routinely used yet and further research is needed, early studies suggest that neck size is another tool that can be used to identify overweight and obesity in boys and girls ages 6 to 18. 

BMI is calculated by taking a child's weight in kilograms and dividing it by a child's height in meters squared. The doctor calculates your child's body mass index (BMI) and determines where it falls on a standard BMI-for-age growth chart. BMI helps indicate if your child is overweight for his or her age and height. BMI, however, doesn't consider factors such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame and the variation in growth patterns among children. As a result, the doctor must also consider your child's growth and development to determine whether your child's weight is a health concern. 

Unlike BMI, measuring a child's neck size to identify obesity is straightforward — the doctor simply places measuring tape around the most prominent part of your child's neck and compares the measurement to values that indicate overweight and obesity for your child's age. Neck size also is a better gauge of upper body fat than is BMI. That's important because upper body fat can help predict certain obesity-related complications, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and obstructive sleep apnea. 

If you're interested in having your child's neck size measured or you're concerned about your child's weight, consult your child's doctor.

		I've heard that eating negative-calorie foods might be a good diet strategy. But what exactly are they?
	","
The Internet abounds with lists of purported negative-calorie foods — foods that supposedly take more energy to digest than they provide in calories. Many of these foods are vegetables and fruits, which can be part of an overall healthy diet plan. But they're probably not negative-calorie. 

The theory is that you can lose weight by eating lots of these negative-calorie foods. Celery is a commonly cited example because it's mainly water and fiber. Proponents claim that you will burn more calories digesting celery than it contains, for a net loss.

Here's the reality. Throughout the day, about 5 to 10 percent of your total energy expenditure goes to digest and store the nutrients in the food you eat. Foods that contain few calories, such as celery and other nonstarchy vegetables, provide a small number of calories but still require energy to digest. That means it is theoretically possible to have a negative-calorie food, but there are no reputable scientific studies to prove that certain foods have this effect.

The bottom line: Following extreme diets that promote eating only a few foods can cause you to miss out on important nutrients. The key to successful weight loss is adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise.

		What does it mean to have a nervous breakdown?
	","
The term ""nervous breakdown"" is sometimes used to describe a stressful situation in which someone becomes temporarily unable to function normally in day-to-day life. It's commonly understood to occur when life's demands become physically and emotionally overwhelming. The term was commonly used in the past to cover a variety of mental disorders; it's used less often today. 

Nervous breakdown isn't a medical term, however, nor does it indicate a specific mental illness. But that doesn't mean it's a normal or a healthy response to stress. A nervous breakdown may indicate an underlying mental health problem that needs attention, such as depression or anxiety. 

Signs of a nervous breakdown vary from person to person and depend on the underlying cause. Exactly what constitutes a nervous breakdown also varies from one culture to another. Generally, it's understood to mean that a person is no longer able to function normally. For example, he or she may:

A number of other unusual or dysfunctional behaviors may be considered signs and symptoms of a nervous breakdown.

If you're concerned that you're experiencing a nervous breakdown, get help. If you have a primary care doctor, talk to him or her about your signs and symptoms or seek help from a mental health provider.

		Is there such a thing as a nervous stomach? I've been told that I have one.
	","
Nervous stomach is an old-fashioned term for chronic indigestion. The idea of having a nervous organ could be a holdover from about 100 years ago, when a syndrome called nervous exhaustion or neurasthenia — thought to be caused by ""nerve irritation"" — was a fairly common diagnosis. The typical treatment was a long period of rest. 

Today, it would be unusual for a doctor to say you have a nervous stomach. That said, your nervous system can definitely affect your digestion. In fact, some functions of your nervous and digestive systems are so interdependent that they're thought of as a unit — the brain-gut axis. Your digestive tract also has its own separate nervous system, known as the enteric nervous system, which operates independently of your brain to regulate certain aspects of digestion. 

The brain-gut axis could be involved in the chronic digestive problems known as functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, and functional abdominal pain. These conditions aren't the result of a structural abnormality or infection in your gastrointestinal tract, but they can take a serious toll on your quality of life. 

If you have a recurrent digestive problem, tell your doctor what it is — stomach pain, heartburn, bloating, diarrhea or several symptoms at different times. You'll also need a physical examination, possibly followed by tests to diagnose or rule out an ulcer, gallstones or any other specific disease your symptoms suggest. 

This workup may not identify a specific abnormality. If you're otherwise healthy, though, further testing is usually unnecessary. Instead, your doctor may suggest that you keep a symptom record and track your diet, mealtimes, stress levels and other variables that may be triggering your problems. This record may highlight a few simple changes you can make to reduce the frequency of your symptoms. A combination of lifestyle adjustment, medication and behavioral treatment usually brings functional gastrointestinal disorders under control.

A neti pot is a container designed to rinse your nasal cavity. You might use a neti pot to treat nasal allergies, sinus problems or colds. In fact, many people believe that regular use of a neti pot is more effective for nasal allergy and sinus symptoms than are over-the-counter medications. 

If you are making your own saltwater solution, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using bottled water that has been distilled or sterilized. Tap water is acceptable if it's been passed through a filter with a 1-micron pore size or if it's been boiled for several minutes and then left to cool. 

To use the neti pot, tilt your head over the sink, place the spout of the pot in the upper nostril and gently pour in the water. As you pour, the water will flow through your nasal cavity and out the lower nostril. Repeat on the other side. 

Be sure to rinse the irrigation device after each use with similarly distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered water and leave open to air dry.

		What are common side effects of Neurontin? How can I manage side effects?

Gabapentin (Neurontin) is a medication used to help manage certain epileptic seizures and relieve pain in some painful conditions. Common Neurontin side effects are dizziness and drowsiness. Some people may also experience weight gain and unsteadiness.

Some Neurontin side effects, such as drowsiness, are more likely to occur when you first start taking the drug. These side effects may go away after a period of time, as your body adjusts. Other side effects may occur because of the combination of drugs that you're taking. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose of one or more medications or suggest a new medication to help alleviate such side effects.

Also, it's important to note that in January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that people taking anti-seizure (anti-epileptic) drugs, including Neurontin, may have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since the announcement of the FDA's warning, some studies have indicated that not all seizure medications are associated with the increased risk. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits in your case.

If you have questions about Neurontin side effects or are experiencing troublesome side effects that aren't going away, talk to your doctor. And be sure to talk to a doctor or counselor immediately if you're having suicidal thoughts.

		Should I wake my newborn for feedings?
	","
Whether you should wake a sleeping newborn for feedings depends on the baby's age, weight and overall health. 

Most newborns lose weight in the first few days after birth. Until your newborn regains this lost weight — usually within one to two weeks after birth — it's important to feed him or her frequently. This might mean occasionally waking your baby for a feeding, especially if he or she sleeps for a stretch of more than four hours. Once your newborn establishes a pattern of weight gain and reaches the birth-weight milestone, however, it's generally OK to wait for feedings until he or she wakes up. 

Most newborns need eight to 12 feedings a day — about one feeding every two to three hours. While waking up a sleeping baby might seem like a bad idea, frequent feedings early on are important for a couple of reasons: 

Keep in mind that premature babies often have special nutritional needs. If your baby was born prematurely or you're concerned about your baby's feeding patterns or weight gain, consult his or her doctor for specific recommendations.

Normal weight obesity means you may have the same serious health risks as does someone who's obese. Obesity is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat — not as weighing too much.

A formula called body mass index (BMI) is used to determine whether you're at a healthy weight for your height. But BMI doesn't tell the whole story because it doesn't measure body fat. So you may have a normal BMI while your body fat percentage is high enough to increase health risks.

Researchers are still trying to determine what percentage of body fat counts as obesity when your weight is normal, and whether guidelines should be different depending on your age and sex.

Like obesity, normal weight obesity may increase your risk of serious health problems, including:

If you're concerned about your body fat percentage, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may want to measure your body fat and recommend additional tests to see if you're at risk of obesity-related conditions. Your doctor may also encourage you to start eating healthier and increase your activity level.

What causes tingling numbness in hands?,"There are many possible causes of tingling or numbness in hands. The most common cause is carpal tunnel syndrome. This is due to narrowing of the carpal tunnel — which normally protects a main (median) nerve to your hand as well as to several tendons that bend your fingers — in your wrist. Pressure on the median nerve can cause numbness in your wrist, fingers, hand or forearm.Other causes of numbness in hands include:It's important to determine the cause of numbness in hands. If numbness persists or spreads to other parts of your body, consult your doctor for an evaluation. Treatment of numbness in hands depends on the underlying cause."

		I have chronic migraines and have had varying degrees of success with different treatments. Could occipital nerve stimulation help?
	","
Occipital nerve stimulation is a procedure used to treat chronic headache disorders, including chronic migraines. Although occipital nerve stimulation was first used for migraines in 1977, it is still a treatment in development.

Surgical procedures for occipital nerve stimulation vary, but in general, a small device is implanted at the base of the skull — near the occipital nerve. The device is then connected to a power source that sends electrical impulses to the occipital nerve. The power source is also implanted, often under the collarbone (clavicle), but the abdominal and gluteal areas also are options. After occipital nerve stimulation, the need for surgical revision of wire placement is common. Infection also is a risk.

Research indicates that occipital nerve stimulation may improve headaches for some people who try the therapy. However, studies on occipital nerve stimulation so far have included only a small number of participants — and long-term results aren't yet available.

The bottom line? Although there's evidence that occipital nerve stimulation can be effective in the treatment of chronic headache disorders, more studies are needed before the approach can be considered a routine headache treatment.

What is an ocular migraine?,"Ocular migraines are characterized by abnormal visual sensations. They occur most often in people with a history of classic migraines. Ocular migraines are sometimes followed by head pain.When an ocular migraine starts, you may notice a small, shimmering spot near the center of your field of vision. Initially, you may only be aware that something isn't quite right with your vision.However, within a few minutes, the shimmering spot expands. You may become aware of a distinct visual abnormality accompanied by patchy vision loss - usually affecting both eyes. The shimmering area may also be bordered by silvery or colored zigzag light patterns. This zigzag pattern eventually expands into the outer part of the visual field. Within 15 to 30 minutes, the visual abnormality travels far out into the side vision and then disappears.The cause of ocular migraines isn't clearly understood. But they're thought to be due to abnormal stimulation of nerve cells (neurons) at the back of the brain. Like classic migraines, ocular migraines tend to occur irregularly but repeatedly. You may experience several ocular migraines within a week and then not have any for months or years. Some people have heightened sensitivity to light or sound before the start of an ocular migraine.Ocular migraines typically need no treatment. However, if they're often followed by headaches, you doctor may recommend medication to relieve headache pain."

		What is an ocular migraine? Is it a sign of something serious?
	","
The term ""ocular migraine"" can be confusing. It's sometimes used to refer to two different conditions, one of which usually isn't cause for concern, and the other which might have more-serious complications. 

<strong>Migraine aura involving your vision<br/>
</strong>In some cases, ocular migraine describes a migraine aura that involves your vision. Migraine auras include a variety of sensations — often visual, but which also may include other sensations, such as numbness — that precede or accompany a migraine. Aura can sometimes occur without an associated headache.

A migraine aura that affects your vision is common. Visual symptoms are short lasting. A migraine aura involving your vision will affect both eyes, and you may see: 

These symptoms can temporarily interfere with certain activities such as reading or driving, but the condition usually isn't considered serious.

<strong>Retinal migraine<br/>
</strong>Sometimes, ocular migraine is used as a synonym for the medical term ""retinal migraine."" A retinal migraine is a rare condition occurring in a person who has experienced other symptoms of migraine. Retinal migraine involves repeated bouts of short-lasting, diminished vision or blindness. This may precede or accompany a headache.

A retinal migraine — unlike a migraine aura affecting vision — will affect only one eye, not both. However, most often, loss of vision in one eye isn't related to migraine. It's generally caused by some other more serious condition. So if you experience visual loss in one eye, be sure to see an eye specialist.

Is it true that children born to older fathers are at increased risk of autism?,"A growing body of evidence suggests that a father's age (paternal age) may play a role in autism risk.A large study published in the Archives of General Psychiatry in 2006 examined the relationship between advancing paternal age and autism risk. Researchers reported that children born to men 40 years or older were almost six times more likely to have autism spectrum disorder than were children born to men younger than 30 years.The reason for this increased risk of autism isn't clear. One theory is that as men age, their genetic material loses some ability to repair itself. As a result, spontaneous mutations in genes may be passed on rather than corrected — potentially leading to an increased risk of brain abnormalities in their children. Researchers have identified a number of gene mutations associated with autism.On a related note, advancing maternal age appears to have little effect on autism risk."

		If olive oil is high in fat, why is it considered healthy?
	","
The main type of fat found in all kinds of olive oil is monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). MUFAs are actually considered a healthy dietary fat. If your diet emphasizes unsaturated fats, such as MUFAs and polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), instead of saturated fats and trans fats, you may gain certain health benefits.

MUFAs and PUFAs may help lower your risk of heart disease by improving related risk factors. For instance, MUFAs may lower your total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. MUFAs may also help normalize blood clotting. And some research shows that MUFAs may also benefit insulin levels and blood sugar control, which can be especially helpful if you have type 2 diabetes.

But even healthier fats like olive oil are high in calories, so use them only in moderation. Choose MUFA-rich foods such as olive oil instead of other fatty foods — particularly butter and stick margarine — not in addition to them. And remember that you can't make unhealthy foods healthier simply by adding olive oil to them.

Also, be aware that heat, light and air can affect the taste of olive oil and possibly its health-promoting nutrients. Store olive oil in a dark, room-temperature cupboard, or even in the refrigerator. The fats and healthy phytonutrients in olive oil — as well as the taste — can slowly degrade over time, so it's probably best to use it within a year or within six months once opened.

		What are omega-6 fatty acids? Can eating omega-6 fatty acids cause heart disease?
	","
Omega-6 fatty acids are a type of unsaturated fat found in vegetable oils, nuts and seeds. When eaten in moderation and in place of the saturated fats found in meats and dairy products, omega-6 fatty acids can actually be good for your heart and brain. 

There had been some controversy regarding omega-6 fatty acids. Some researchers had believed that omega-6 fatty acids metabolize in your body to become a type of fatty acid that can cause the lining of your arteries to become inflamed and damaged. That damage causes narrowing in your arteries, which can lead to heart disease. 

However, the American Heart Association (AHA) has said that this view is incorrect. The AHA recommends that people eat between 5 and 10 percent of their daily calories from omega-6 fatty acids. Most people already eat this amount of omega-6 fatty acids. If you're concerned about the amount of omega-6 fatty acids you're eating, talk to your doctor about replacing some of the saturated fats in your diet with healthier options.

		If I have my ovaries removed before I'm 50, will I be more likely to have dementia when I get older?
	","
You might, but more research is needed to know for sure. Ovary removal (oophorectomy), often done in conjunction with hysterectomy, has a dramatic effect on your body before menopause. This abrupt loss of your ovaries is also called surgical menopause, because it triggers all the changes of menopause.

Your ovaries produce most of your body's estrogen, a reproductive hormone that has many functions beyond regulating your menstrual cycle. Estrogen may protect your brain from age-related changes leading to cognitive impairment and dementia. 

Some studies have suggested that early oophorectomy may increase your risk of dementia or other cognitive function deficits. Some research suggests that you may help offset this risk by taking hormone therapy (HT) until you reach a natural age of menopause.

More research will be needed before doctors can know for sure whether oophorectomy will increase your risk of dementia and whether HT is necessary. 

That's why it's important to talk with your doctor before deciding to have an oophorectomy. 

<strong>Ask your doctor: </strong>

For some women, oophorectomy is worth the long-term risks. If you carry one of the genetic mutations that make you likely to develop breast and ovarian cancers, for example, this surgery may save your life — even if you don't take HT.

		Can older people safely take opioids, such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, to manage arthritis pain?
	","
In general, older people can take opioids safely. But an opioid isn't the first choice for treating chronic joint pain caused by osteoarthritis. Instead, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) is recommended as the first line medication for older people with mild to moderate arthritis pain. 

Opioids have risks that may be particularly serious for older people, including: 

Acetaminophen is effective and generally safe, although high doses can cause serious liver damage. The adult dose of over-the-counter acetaminophen is 325 to 660 milligrams (mg) every four to six hours, never to exceed a total of 4 grams within any 24-hour period. Because older people metabolize drugs less efficiently, they tend to do well with doses at the low end of that range. If you drink heavily, have alcohol-related liver damage or have a history of any kind of liver disease, don't exceed a total of 2 grams of acetaminophen in a day.

Also, if you're taking a prescription pain medication that contains acetaminophen and an opioid, don't take any additional over-the-counter acetaminophen. Examples of these combination drugs include codeine and acetaminophen (Tylenol with codeine), oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet), and hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Vicodin, Norco).

Older people should avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, others), for osteoarthritis pain. Recent studies have found high rates of bleeding in the digestive tract among older people on NSAID therapy. Worsening of heart failure and increased risk of kidney disease are other problems linked to chronic NSAID use in older people.

Does having optic neuritis mean you will eventually develop multiple sclerosis?,"Not everyone who has an episode of optic neuritis develops multiple sclerosis (MS). Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which usually leads to temporary vision loss in the affected eye. Optic neuritis can occur as a symptom of multiple sclerosis. But it can also occur as an isolated attack without recurrence or as a symptom of other demyelinating diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica.In one study published in January 2002 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the risk of developing multiple sclerosis following a single episode of optic neuritis was 69 percent after 14 years. The strongest predictor of multiple sclerosis in the study group of 77 people was the presence of brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Those with abnormal MRI scans had an 88 percent risk of developing MS after 14 years, and those with normal MRI scans had only a 19 percent risk.In a similar study published in July 2003 in the Archives of Ophthalmology, the risk of developing multiple sclerosis following a single episode of optic neuritis was 38 percent after 10 years. Within the study group of 388 people, those with brain lesions on MRI scans had a 56 percent risk of developing MS after 10 years, and those with normal MRI scans had a 22 percent risk."

		What is the best way to screen for oral cancer? Are special oral cancer screening tests better than an oral exam?
	","
Most dentists perform an examination of your mouth during a routine dental visit to screen for oral cancer. Some dentists may use additional tests to aid in identifying areas of abnormal cells in your mouth. The goal with oral cancer screening is to identify cancer early, when there is a greater chance for a cure. 

Screening for oral cancer isn't without controversy, though. No single oral exam or oral cancer screening test is proven to reduce the risk of dying of oral cancer. Still, you and your dentist may decide that an oral exam or a special test is right for you based on your risk factors. 

<strong>Oral exam for oral cancer screening</strong> <br/>
Most dentists recommend an oral exam during your routine dental visit to screen for oral cancer. During an oral exam, your dentist looks over the inside of your mouth to check for red or white patches or mouth sores. Using gloved hands, your dentist also feels the tissues in your mouth to check for lumps or other abnormalities. 

Many people have abnormal sores in their mouths, with the great majority being noncancerous. An oral exam can't determine which sores are cancerous and which are not. If your dentist finds an unusual sore, you may go through further testing to determine its cause. The only way to definitively determine whether you have oral cancer is to remove some abnormal cells and test them for cancer in a procedure called a biopsy. 

Not all medical organizations agree about the benefits of an oral exam for oral cancer screening. For instance, the American Dental Association recommends all adults undergo periodic oral exams when they visit the dentist. The American Cancer Society recommends discussing oral cancer screening when you visit your dentist. But the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that there is insufficient evidence either for or against routine oral cancer screening in adults. The USPSTF also says that techniques other than the standard oral exam are being evaluated but are still experimental. 

<strong>Additional tests for oral cancer screening</strong> <br/>
Some dentists use special tests in addition to the oral exam to screen for oral cancer. It's not clear if these tests offer any additional benefit over the oral exam. Special oral cancer screening tests include: 

Special tests for oral cancer screening aren't always covered by dental insurance. Some tests may be covered if you have a high risk of oral cancer or if your dentist has discovered an area of abnormal cells in your mouth. 

<strong>Who should consider oral cancer screening</strong> <br/>
People with a high risk of oral cancer may be more likely to benefit from oral cancer screening, though studies haven't clearly proved that. Factors that can increase the risk of oral cancer include: 

Ask your dentist whether oral cancer screening is appropriate for you. Also ask about ways you can reduce your risk of oral cancer, such as quitting smoking and not drinking alcohol.

		I need a new dental crown, but I dislike having my mouth numb for hours afterward. Can OraVerse speed my recovery?
	","
OraVerse speeds up the return of normal sensation to your lips and mouth following dental work — including fillings, crowns and root canals — requiring a local anesthetic that may also numb your lips cheeks and tongue. The numbness can last two or more hours after the procedure. When your mouth and lips are numb, smiling, talking and drinking can be difficult.

Phentolamine mesylate (OraVerse) speeds up the return of normal sensation following dental work. Studies show that OraVerse — given as an injection after dental work is finished — returns normal sensations in the lips, cheeks and tongue 75 to 85 minutes faster than without the drug.

How OraVerse works isn't fully understood, but it's thought to increase blood flow to the soft tissue area. OraVerse only works if the original anesthetic contains a medication that narrows your blood vessels (vasoconstrictor), such as epinephrine.

Phentolamine mesylate belongs to a class of drugs that can cause rapid heartbeats and irregular heart rhythms. Though such events are uncommon with OraVerse, tell your dentist if you have a history of cardiovascular disease.

OraVerse is not recommended for children under age 6 or for children who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kilograms). The use of OraVerse requires an additional fee and isn't covered by dental insurance.

Can someone who has had cancer be an organ donor?,"In general, people who have been diagnosed with or have a history of cancer are excluded from organ donation. However, under certain circumstances exceptions may be made in using organs from donors with a history of certain cancers. This is particularly true if the cancer was successfully treated many years ago, and there is no evidence it has recurred. In addition, some types of skin cancer and brain cancer almost always remain localized and don't spread. Some individuals with such cancers also may be acceptable organ donors.According to the American Cancer Society, the risk of passing on cancer to an organ recipient is exceedingly small. However, there have been rare reports in the medical literature of this happening."

		Is organic baby food better for my baby?
	","
Organic foods are produced without conventional pesticides, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics or growth hormones. Feeding your baby organic baby food might limit his or her exposure to these substances. 

Conventional growers use pesticides to protect their crops from molds, insects and diseases. When farmers spray pesticides, this can leave residue on produce. Organic produce carries significantly fewer pesticide residues than does conventional produce. 

Some people might buy organic baby food to limit their babies' exposure to these residues — since infants might be more susceptible to harm potentially caused by pesticides than are adults. However, residues on most products — both organic and nonorganic — don't exceed government safety thresholds. 

Generally, research hasn't shown organic foods to be more nutritious than nonorganic foods. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides organic seals for products that contain various percentages of organic ingredients — but the USDA makes no claims or guarantees that organic foods are safer or more nutritious than are nonorganic foods.

Some parents prefer organic baby food because it's environmentally friendly. Others feel that organic baby food simply tastes better. What's most important, however, is a balanced diet. Offering your child healthy foods from the beginning — whether they're organic or not — will set the stage for a lifetime of healthy eating.

		I've been taking prednisone for my rheumatoid arthritis, but I've heard that it can increase my chances of developing osteoporosis. How big is the risk?
	","
Prednisone and similar drugs all cause bone loss. It's difficult, however, to separate prednisone use from the other things that might increase your risk of osteoporosis — your age, your sex and some aspects of your lifestyle, for example. Rheumatoid arthritis itself can lead to bone loss. 

Prednisone is a corticosteroid (kor-tih-ko-STARE-oid) medication, highly effective for treating inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis and many other conditions. Unfortunately, corticosteroids also interfere with bone maintenance and limit the amount of calcium absorbed by your intestines. This can dramatically weaken bones and lead to osteoporosis.

In general, the higher the dose of prednisone you take and the longer you take it, the greater the risk. To counter the risk, do weightbearing exercise, avoid alcohol and do not smoke. Taking calcium and vitamin D supplements also can help reduce the amount of bone loss caused by steroids such as prednisone. 

If you'll be taking prednisone for more than a few months and you have other risk factors for bone loss, your doctor may prescribe medications specifically designed to treat osteoporosis.

However, it is important to note that osteoporosis medications may decrease the risk of fractures even when there is no apparent increase in bone density.

		Tell me about ovarian cancer vaccines that are supposed to prevent recurrence of ovarian cancer. Do they work?
	","
Research continues in the development of a number of vaccines designed to prevent the recurrence of ovarian cancer. So far, ovarian cancer vaccines are available only in clinical trial studies. 

One theory behind ovarian cancer vaccines is that they stimulate the immune system to detect and eliminate any cancer cells that reappear after initial treatment has been completed. Vaccines under study include abagovomab and oregovomab. 

Abagovomab has been shown to elicit an immune response in women with ovarian cancer, but it's not known if this improves the outcome. Major clinical trials studying abagovomab are currently underway. Oregovomab also has been tested and has been shown to elicit an immune response. But one study showed no difference in the recurrence rate in women who got oregovomab as compared with a placebo. Other vaccines are also being studied, as are ways to help boost the effectiveness of the vaccines. 

Surgery followed by chemotherapy remains the standard primary treatment for ovarian cancer. One aspect of ovarian cancer vaccine research includes examining how best to use these vaccines in combination with chemotherapy. 

Although research has shown that ovarian cancer vaccines may hold promise, these studies have involved only small numbers of participants. More and larger studies are needed to further evaluate the potential role that vaccines may play in preventing recurrent ovarian cancer.

Some of these medications help your body produce more high-quality eggs or stimulate the development of multiple egg-containing follicles.This stimulation improves your odds for successful IVF — but it's possible to stimulate the ovaries too much. This condition, known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), affects only a small percentage of women attempting IVF. Younger women and those who have a low body weight or a hormonal disorder known as polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher risk of developing OHSS. Women who conceive also are more likely to develop this complication.Most cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are mild. Signs and symptoms — including bloating, abdominal discomfort, nausea and diarrhea — often resolve without treatment within two weeks or when your period begins. If you become pregnant, recovery may take longer.If you have ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, take it easy. Avoid heavy lifting, strenuous exercise and sexual intercourse. Your doctor may recommend drinking clear fluids or electrolyte drinks, such as Gatorade. If needed, ask your doctor about pain relievers.Rarely, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome causes fluid to accumulate in the abdominal and chest cavities. Signs and symptoms of extensive fluid accumulation may include abdominal swelling and shortness of breath. This fluid accumulation can deplete blood volume and lower blood pressure. Severe cases may require emergency treatment and hospitalization to prevent life-threatening complications.Some studies suggest that women who have ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome are more likely to develop gestational diabetes and high blood pressure during pregnancy.

When one ovary is removed, the remaining ovary usually compensates for the loss. As a result, women with one ovary typically ovulate as frequently as women with two ovaries. No fertility treatment is required to ""boost"" the remaining ovary.If you are having trouble getting pregnant, you may want to consider other causes of infertility, such as scarring from your complicated appendectomy. If you have been unable to conceive after one year of unprotected sexual intercourse, consult your doctor for infertility evaluation."

Ozone can mask odors by changing the chemical composition of particles or other gasses in the air, making the air seem fresher and cleaner. However, ozone generators don't actually filter out the small particles that trigger asthma. 

Inhaling ozone, even in small amounts, can irritate the lungs. Specific effects may include throat irritation, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath, as well as an increased risk of respiratory infections.

Some ozone air purifiers are made with an ion generator or ""ionizer"" in the same unit. You can also buy ionizers as separate units. Ionizers do remove particles from the air, causing them to attach to nearby surfaces or to each other and settle out of the air — but they may generate unwanted ozone. 

Air filters that remove small particles — such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters — are effective in removing allergens from the air, without posing any ozone concerns. To work effectively, filters need to be cleaned or replaced regularly, according the manufacturer's instructions.

		Is there a link between pain and depression? Can depression cause physical pain?
	","
Pain and depression are closely related. Depression can cause pain — and pain can cause depression. Sometimes pain and depression create a vicious cycle in which pain worsens symptoms of depression, and then the resulting depression worsens feelings of pain. 

In many people, depression causes unexplained physical symptoms such as back pain or headaches. Sometimes this kind of pain is the first or the only sign of depression. 

Pain and the problems it causes can wear you down over time, and may begin to affect your mood. Chronic pain causes a number of problems that can lead to depression, such as trouble sleeping and stress. Disabling pain can cause low self-esteem due to work, legal or financial issues. Depression doesn't just occur with pain resulting from an injury. It's also common in people who have pain linked to a health condition such as diabetes or migraines. 

To get symptoms of pain and depression under control, you may need separate treatment for each condition. However, some treatments may help with both.

Treatment for co-occurring pain and depression may be most effective when it involves a combination of treatments.

If you have pain and depression, get help before your symptoms worsen. You don't have to be miserable. Getting the right treatment can help you start enjoying life again.

		I sometimes have joint pain caused by palindromic rheumatism. As I get older, are these attacks likely to damage my joints?
	","
Palindromic rheumatism is closely linked to rheumatoid arthritis, which damages joints by causing chronic inflammation. Right now, though, there's no reliable way to predict how quickly palindromic rheumatism will progress — or whether it will get worse at all. 

Palindromic rheumatism causes sudden attacks of joint pain and swelling, typically in the hands and feet. An episode of palindromic rheumatism may last from just a few hours to several days. 

The frequency of attacks also varies. Some people experience more than one episode a week, while others have only three or four a year. Between attacks, pain and swelling completely disappear, and the affected joints look normal on X-rays. 

An unknown number of people with palindromic rheumatism go on to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but the progression may take several years. In one study, 40 out of 60 people newly diagnosed with palindromic rheumatism had chronic joint inflammation within 10 years. Progression to rheumatoid arthritis was less common in other studies with shorter follow-up periods. 

Drugs originally designed to combat malaria are often helpful in reducing the frequency and duration of attacks. These drugs also appear to reduce the likelihood that palindromic rheumatism will progress to rheumatoid arthritis.

		I'm receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and my doctor has suggested I see a palliative care specialist. Does this mean my prognosis isn't good?
	","
Not necessarily. Palliative care is for anyone who has been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The goal of the palliative care specialist is to reduce any signs and symptoms you may experience and make you more comfortable. 

Palliative care is often confused with hospice care, which is generally reserved for people with terminal illnesses. Hospice care workers provide palliative care, but palliative care can be given at any time during an illness, not just at the end of life. 

A palliative care specialist works with your doctor and a team of chaplains, counselors, nurses and other professionals to create an individualized plan to reduce signs and symptoms you experience during your treatment. This can make it more likely that you'll complete your treatment and maintain a quality of life that allows you to continue doing things that are important to you. 

Recent data shows that for people with certain types of cancer, early use of palliative care services not only makes them feel better, but also helps them live longer when compared with people who get standard treatment only.

What causes pancreatic insufficiency?,"Pancreatic insufficiency typically results from damage to the pancreas. This may be caused by a variety of conditions. The most common causes are cystic fibrosis in children and chronic inflammation of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis) in adults. A less common cause of pancreatic insufficiency is pancreatic cancer.Your pancreas makes and secretes digestive juices and enzymes that break down fats, carbohydrates and proteins in the foods you eat. If you have pancreatic insufficiency, your pancreas doesn't make or secrete enough of these enzymes for proper digestion to take place.Severe pancreatic insufficiency impairs absorption of nutrients by the intestine. This can lead to deficiencies of essential nutrients. Also, decreased absorption of fat leads to increased fat in stools (steatorrhea), which results in weight loss, diarrhea, and pale, bulky, foul-smelling stools.When possible, treatment of pancreatic insufficiency is directed at the underlying cause of pancreatic damage. Treatment may also include:"

		Can ovarian cancer be detected by a Pap smear?
	","
No. A Pap smear can't reliably detect ovarian cancer. 

A Pap smear is a procedure that collects cells from your cervix. A Pap smear can detect cervical cancer and changes in your cervical cells that may increase your risk of cervical cancer in the future. 

Very rarely, ovarian cancer cells can be detected during a Pap smear. If the ovarian cancer cells travel away from your ovaries through your fallopian tubes and uterus to the area around your cervix, the ovarian cancer cells could be collected during a Pap smear. But this is rare, so the Pap smear isn't a reliable test for ovarian cancer. 

There is no standard or routine screening test for ovarian cancer. Researchers haven't yet found a screening tool that's sensitive enough to detect ovarian cancer in its early stages and specific enough to distinguish ovarian cancer from other, noncancerous conditions. Doctors don't recommend routine screening for women with an average risk of ovarian cancer. 

Whether women with a high risk of ovarian cancer may benefit from screening is a point of debate. Experts don't agree on exactly what to do for screening, when to do it or if it should be done at all. 

If you're concerned about your risk of ovarian cancer, discuss it with your doctor.

		Do virgins need Pap smears? Does a Pap smear cause you to lose your virginity?
	","
If you're a virgin — meaning you haven't had sexual (vaginal) intercourse — you probably don't need a Pap smear. And even if you do have a Pap smear, it will not cause you to lose your virginity. Although the instruments used to collect the cervical cells may stretch or even tear your hymen — the thin tissue covering the vaginal opening, which is present in some women who've never had sex — you will only lose your virginity when you have sexual intercourse. 

The purpose of a Pap smear is to collect cells from your cervix, which is the lower end of your uterus. The cells collected in a Pap smear can detect if you have cervical cancer or suspicious cells that indicate you may develop cervical cancer. 

In most cases, cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted infection called human papillomavirus (HPV). If you've never had any type of sexual intercourse, you're unlikely to have HPV. However, there are other risk factors for developing cervical cancer, such as family history and smoking, so talk to your doctor if you have concerns. 

For effective cervical cancer screening, the American Cancer Society recommends that all women have an initial Pap smear by the age of 21, regardless of whether or not they've had sexual intercourse, or after they've been sexually active for three years, whichever comes first. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women begin having Pap smears at age 21, regardless of when they become sexually active.

"
		Are Pap smears still needed after removal of the uterus (hysterectomy)?
	","
It depends. 

A Pap smear, also called a Pap test, is an important screening test for early diagnosis of cervical cancer. 

If you had a partial hysterectomy — when the uterus is removed but the neck of the uterus (cervix) remains — your health care provider will likely recommend continued Pap smears. 

Similarly, if you had a partial hysterectomy or a total hysterectomy — when both the uterus and cervix are removed — for a cancerous or precancerous condition, regular Pap smears remain important. 

You can stop having Pap smears, however, if you had a total hysterectomy for a noncancerous condition. 

Your age matters, too. 

According to guidelines from the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you can stop routine Pap smear screening after age 65 — whether you've had a hysterectomy or not — if you have a history of regular screenings with normal results and you're not at high risk of cervical cancer. 

If you're unsure whether you still need Pap smears, ask your doctor what's best for you.

		I was recently diagnosed with parkinsonism. What causes it, and how can I cope as it progresses?
	","
Parkinsonism is any condition that causes a combination of the movement abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease — such as tremor, slow movement, impaired speech or muscle stiffness — especially resulting from the loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells (neurons).

<strong>Possible causes</strong>

Not everyone who has parkinsonism has Parkinson's disease. Other causes of parkinsonism can include:

<strong>The role of medications</strong>

However, these drugs aren't likely to be as effective for some forms of parkinsonism as they are for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa — which occurs naturally in the body and is always taken as a combination drug — replenishes brain dopamine, and brain dopamine loss is fundamental to Parkinson's disease. However, in other parkinsonian disorders, additional brain circuits besides dopamine may be affected.

		What are the signs and symptoms of passive-aggressive behavior?
	","
Passive-aggressive behavior is a pattern of indirectly expressing negative feelings instead of openly addressing them. There's a disconnect between what a passive-aggressive person says and what he or she does. For a passive-aggressive person, true feelings are shared through actions, not words. 

For example, a passive-aggressive person might appear to agree — perhaps even enthusiastically — with another person's request. Rather than completing the task, however, he or she might express anger or resentment by missing deadlines, showing up late to meetings, making excuses or even working against the task. 

Specific signs and symptoms of passive-aggressive behavior include: 

Although passive-aggressive behavior can be a feature of various mental health conditions, it isn't considered a mental illness. If passive-aggressive behavior is interfering with your relationships or daily activities, consult a therapist who can help you identify and try to change your behavior.

Can a child outgrow a peanut allergy?,"Yes. About 20 percent to 25 percent of children with peanut allergy will outgrow it. But there is a small risk it will return. Peanut allergy affects 1 percent to 2 percent of young children and is the most common cause of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction.It's difficult to predict which children will outgrow peanut allergy. Some research suggests that children with lower levels of peanut allergy-specific antibodies (IgE) may be more likely to outgrow peanut allergy than children with higher levels of these antibodies. IgE is measured by a blood test.Even when a child appears to outgrow peanut allergy, there is a small risk it will recur. A study published in November 2004 suggested that the way to reduce the risk of recurrence is to encourage the child to eat peanuts on a regular basis. This may seem odd advice to parents who have drilled a fear of peanuts into their children. But the study found peanut allergy was much less likely to return in children who ate peanuts at least once a month after developing a tolerance for them than in children who largely avoided peanuts.How do you know if your child has outgrown peanut allergy? Children with known peanut allergy should be re-evaluated by a board-certified allergist before discontinuing any preventive or avoidance measures. Even if it is determined that a child has outgrown peanut allergy, doctors still recommend that the child continue to carry injectable epinephrine in case the allergy returns."
My son has a peanut allergy. Can he safely use Nutella in place of peanut butter?,"Nutella is a chocolate hazelnut spread that also contains peanut oil. Some individuals with a peanut allergy may safely consume peanut oil. But there is a chance that the peanut oil could contain some proteins from the peanut, which would make it unsafe for people with peanut allergy. It is probably best to avoid using anything that contains peanut oil unless your son's allergist has told you that it is OK.Also, many allergists recommend that people with peanut allergy also avoid tree nuts — such as hazelnuts — as an added precaution. Check with your doctor regarding your son's specific allergy restrictions."
"A child at my daughter's school has peanut allergy, so the school has banned all peanut products to prevent inadvertently exposing this individual to these products. Is this really necessary?","Most people who have peanut allergy develop allergic reactions only when they eat peanuts or peanut products. Rarely, a person can be so sensitive to peanuts that reactions occur even when exposed only to peanut particles in the air.Keep in mind that kids share food. Also, peanut particles from foods eaten by other children can contaminate surfaces such as tables, plates and utensils. These surfaces could then be touched by a child with peanut allergy, triggering an allergic reaction. One way to reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure is to ban all peanuts and peanut products from the school."
"
		Is it possible to fracture your penis?
	","
Yes. A penis fracture can occur when there is trauma to the erect penis. 

During an erection, the penis is engorged with blood. If the penis is bent suddenly or forcefully while it's engorged, the trauma may rupture the lining of one of the two cylinders in the penis (corpus cavernosum) responsible for erections — resulting in a penis fracture. The trauma is usually related to aggressive or acrobatic sexual intercourse or, in some cases, aggressive masturbation. 

A penis fracture is a painful injury that's often accompanied by an audible cracking sound, followed immediately by dark bruising of the penis due to blood escaping the cylinder. In some cases the tube that drains urine from the body (urethra) may be damaged as well, and blood may be visible at the urinary opening of the penis. 

A penis fracture requires urgent medical attention. A penis fracture can usually be diagnosed with a physical exam, and prompt surgical repair is typically recommended. Left untreated, a penis fracture may result in deformity of the penis or the inability to have or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction).

		What does Percent Daily Value mean on food labels?
	","
The Percent Daily Value on the Nutrition Facts label is a guide to the nutrients in one serving of food. For example, if the label lists 15 percent for calcium, it means that one serving provides 15 percent of the calcium you need each day. 

The Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet for healthy adults. Even if your diet is higher or lower in calories, you can still use the Percent Daily Value as a guide. For example, the Percent Daily Value can help you determine whether a food is high or low in specific nutrients: 

Note that the Food and Drug Administration has not set a Daily Value for trans fat, and health experts recommend avoiding trans fat to lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, there is no established Daily Value for sugar. 

To get the most benefit from Percent Daily Values, use them to choose foods high in vitamins, minerals and fiber — and to limit foods high in fat, cholesterol and sodium.

What are the symptoms of pericardial effusion?,"When excess fluid collects in the sac (pericardium) surrounding the heart, doctors refer to this as pericardial effusion. It may be caused by inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditits). Signs and symptoms of pericardial effusion may include:Causes of pericardial effusion include:If the fluid accumulates slowly, the pericardium may initially stretch enough to accommodate it. Signs and symptoms may not occur until a large amount of fluid collects over time. Rapid fluid accumulation — even if the fluid amount is relatively small — can severely impair the function of the heart. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pericardial effusion compresses the heart and prevents effective pumping of blood to the body. This can be life-threatening.A doctor may confirm a diagnosis by:Treatment depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the heart impairment. Pericardial effusion due to a viral infection usually goes away within a few weeks without treatment. Some pericardial effusions remain small and never need treatment.   If the pericardial effusion is due to a condition such as lupus, treatment with anti-inflammatory medications may help. If the effusion is compromising heart function and causing cardiac tamponade, it will need to be drained, most commonly by a needle inserted through the chest wall and into the pericardial space. A drainage tube is often left in place for several days. In some cases, surgical drainage may be required."

		Are there any hypoallergenic dog breeds?
	","
There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog breed, although some breeds may cause fewer allergy symptoms than others. Many people think that pet allergies are caused by a dog's or cat's fur, but the real source of pet allergies is often a protein that's in the saliva and urine of dogs and cats. This protein sticks to the dead, dried flakes (dander) from your pet's skin. 

Some dog breeds, such as the soft-coated wheaten terrier, or mixed breeds such as the goldendoodle, are marketed as hypoallergenic dogs because they don't shed fur or they shed very little. Because these dogs don't shed, the allergy-causing dander that sticks to their fur doesn't get released into the air or onto the floor as much as it would with a shedding dog. While you may have fewer allergy symptoms with a so-called hypoallergenic dog than with a shedding dog, no dog breed is hypoallergenic. There's some research suggesting that female dogs and Labrador retrievers might put off lower amounts of dog allergens. 

If you're allergic to dogs, but still want to have one, there are some things you can do to reduce your allergy symptoms:

		I've put petroleum jelly on the inside of my nose for years to relieve dryness. Is this safe?
	","
Petroleum jelly is generally safe to use. Rarely, however, inhaling fat-based substances (lipoids) — such as petroleum jelly or mineral oil — for prolonged periods can cause lung problems. 

Typically, petroleum jelly applied to the inside of the nostrils drains down the back of the nose with normal nasal secretions and is swallowed. Rarely, small amounts of the jelly can migrate into the windpipe (trachea) and lungs. Over many months, the jelly can accumulate in the lungs — leading to potentially serious inflammation known as lipoid pneumonia. 

In some people, lipoid pneumonia causes no signs or symptoms. In others, lipoid pneumonia may cause cough, chest pain or shortness of breath. 

Lipoid pneumonia is often detected on a chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan. Sometimes, the diagnosis is confirmed with a bronchoscopy. 

When lipoid pneumonia is caused by petroleum jelly, generally the only treatment is to stop using the petroleum jelly. To relieve nasal dryness without petroleum jelly, use a vaporizer or humidifier or try over-the-counter saline nasal spray. If you must use a lubricant, choose the water-soluble variety. Use it only sparingly, and not within several hours of lying down.

		What causes olfactory hallucinations (phantosmia)?
	","
Many people are sensitive to certain smells, but in an olfactory hallucination (phantosmia), you detect smells that aren't really present in your environment. 

The odors detected in phantosmia vary from person to person and may be foul or pleasant. They can occur in one or both nostrils and usually can't be masked by food. 

Phantosmia most often occurs as a result of a head injury or upper respiratory infection. It can also be caused by temporal lobe seizures, sinusitis, brain tumors, migraine, Parkinson's disease and stroke.

Because phantosmia can in rare cases be an indication of a serious underlying disorder, consult your doctor if you experience such symptoms. 

Note that phantosmia is different from another disorder of sense of smell, known as parosmia, in which a smell is present in your environment but is distorted. Parosmia can occur with damage to the olfactory system, such as after a severe respiratory infection. In this situation, there's usually also a loss of sense of smell.

		Is phentermine a good option for weight loss?
	","
Phentermine (Adipex-P, Suprenza) is an amphetamine-like prescription medication used to suppress appetite. It can help weight loss by decreasing your hunger or making you feel full longer. Phentermine may be recommended as part of an overall weight-loss plan if you're significantly overweight — not if you want to lose just a few pounds.

Phentermine may be a way to kick-start your weight loss. But once you stop taking it, you're likely to regain the weight you lost. That's why phentermine should be part of a plan that includes healthy eating and regular exercise — you're more likely to maintain your weight loss over time if you don't rely solely on medications.

Phentermine is a Schedule IV drug, a classification given to drugs that have a potential for abuse, although the actual potential is low. Phentermine is approved only for short-term use — 12 weeks or less. Although phentermine is one of the most commonly prescribed weight-loss medications, it has some potentially serious drawbacks. Side effects may include: 

Phentermine isn't a good option if you have certain medical conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, an overactive thyroid gland or glaucoma, or if you are pregnant, may become pregnant or are breast-feeding. Also phentermine shouldn't be combined with other weight-loss medications.

		My favorite diet soda has a warning about phenylalanine. Is phenylalanine bad for your health?
	","
Phenylalanine isn't a health concern for most people. But if you have the genetic metabolic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU), or certain other health conditions, phenylalanine can be a serious health concern. If you have PKU, phenylalanine can cause mental retardation, brain damage, seizures and other problems.

Phenylalanine occurs naturally in many protein-rich foods, such as milk, eggs and beef. Phenylalanine also is sold as a dietary supplement. And the artificial sweetener aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet), which is added to many medications, diet foods and diet sodas, contains phenylalanine. Because of this, federal regulations require that any food product that contains aspartame bear a warning stating ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" This warning helps people with PKU and other conditions avoid products that are a source of phenylalanine. 

If you don't have PKU, you probably don't need to worry about harmful health effects of phenylalanine — with certain important exceptions. Aspartame can cause a rapid increase in the brain levels of phenylalanine. Because of this, use products with aspartame cautiously if you:

I see that my favorite cold and allergy medicine now contains phenylephrine instead of pseudoephedrine. But phenylephrine seems to be less effective as a decongestant. So why is it replacing pseudoephedrine?,"Phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine are both decongestants. Until recently, pseudoephedrine has been the more commonly used decongestant and a key ingredient in many popular nonprescription cold and allergy medications. Unfortunately, pseudoephedrine is also a key ingredient in making methamphetamine, a highly addictive illegal stimulant.In an effort to combat methamphetamine production, federal law now requires that all nonprescription medications containing pseudoephedrine be taken off drugstore shelves and kept ""behind the counter"" in the pharmacy. To purchase these medications, you must go to the pharmacy and ask for it. You must also show some form of government-issued identification and sign a logbook.As you might guess, some drug companies are concerned that these ""extra steps"" may discourage people from buying cold and allergy medications containing pseudoephedrine. So they are quietly reformulating these products — removing the decongestant ingredient or replacing pseudoephedrine with phenylephrine.The problem is that phenylephrine generally is a less effective decongestant in the pill form than is pseudoephedrine. Some researchers say the nasal spray form of phenylephrine may work better than the pill form, but nasal spray decongestants should only be used for a few days at a time.So how do you know what you're getting? Read the ingredient lists on your cold and allergy medications to see if they contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine — even if the product packaging looks the same."

Phosphatidylserine (fos-fuh-tie-dul-SER-een) is a dietary supplement that has received some interest as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other memory problems. Several studies involving phosphatidylserine indicate a benefit — improved cognitive abilities and behaviors. However, improvements in memory lasted only a few months and were seen in people with the least severe symptoms.

Initially, phosphatidylserine supplements were derived from the brain cells of cows. However, because of concerns about mad cow disease, most manufacturers now produce phosphatidylserine supplements from soy or cabbage derivatives. Early studies, though promising, were based on cow-derived supplements. It's not known if plant-based phosphatidylserine supplements offer any benefits.

		Is photodynamic therapy an effective treatment for lung cancer?
	","
Photodynamic therapy may play a limited role in lung cancer treatment — generally complementing, rather than replacing, other forms of treatment. 

Photodynamic therapy begins with the injection of a light-sensitive medication into a vein. One to three days later, the doctor shines light of a certain wavelength onto the tumor from inside the body — typically using a thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope, which is passed through the mouth into the lungs. The light destroys the cells that have absorbed the light-sensitive medication, as well as other cells in the area. The goal is to shrink or control the tumor, which can help relieve symptoms such as bleeding, shortness of breath and wheezing. 

After photodynamic therapy, your whole body is sensitive to light. Generally you need to avoid any exposure to bright light, including the sun, for up to six weeks after treatment. 

Photodynamic therapy isn't effective for widespread cancers or tumors that can't be reached by the light.

What can you tell us about it?,"The Pillar procedure is a minimally invasive treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring that involves placement of three tiny polyester rods in the soft palate. This relatively new treatment is recommended for people with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by narrowing of the upper airway during sleep. As air is forced down the narrowed airway, the surrounding tissues vibrate — producing snoring. Further narrowing and collapse of these tissues results in episodes of obstruction that interrupts breathing.Some, but not all, of the upper airway narrowing and collapse in sleep apnea occurs at the level of the soft palate — the fleshy tissue visible at the back of your opened mouth. The inserts stiffen and support the tissue of the soft palate and reduce upper airway collapse and snoring. The Pillar procedure is usually performed in your doctor's office with local anesthesia and takes less than 30 minutes.Keep in mind, not everyone with obstructive sleep apnea is a candidate for the Pillar procedure. The treatment is not recommended for people with severe OSA or other types of apnea. Also, the Pillar procedure may be less effective in overweight individuals. An evaluation by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist can help determine if the Pillar procedure is appropriate in your husband's specific situation.Large clinical trials are under way, including at Mayo Clinic, to further assess the effectiveness of this treatment for OSA."

Pink eye (conjunctivitis) generally remains contagious as long as the eye continues to tear and produce a discharge. Signs and symptoms of pink eye usually improve within three to seven days. When tearing and discharge are no longer present, it's appropriate for a child to return to school or child care. 

If the pink eye is caused by a bacterial infection, treatment with antibiotic drops or ointment for the eyes may be necessary. Some schools and child care facilities require that a child wait at least 24 hours after starting treatment before returning. Good hygiene — including hand-washing after touching the eyes — is important to minimize spread of the disease.

What causes pneumonitis?,"Pneumonitis is a general term for inflammation of lung tissue. Chronic inflammation of lung tissue can lead to irreversible scarring (pulmonary fibrosis). Pneumonitis isn't a specific disease but a sign of an underlying problem. All pneumonias show pneumonitis under the microscope, but not all pneumonitis is pneumonia. Other causes include:Signs and symptoms depend on the severity and underlying cause, if known, and may include:A doctor may diagnose pneumonitis based on:Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include medications such as:"
What is a pneumothorax? Is it the same thing as a collapsed lung?,"Pneumothorax is a condition in which air gets between your lungs and your chest wall. Pneumothorax is one cause of a collapsed lung — a serious, sometimes life-threatening, condition.Normally, two thin layers of moist tissue (pleura) separate your lungs and chest wall. Any air that leaks through lung tissue into this space (pleural space) will cause the lung tissue to collapse in proportion to the amount of air that enters the pleural cavity.Air can collect in the pleural space for many reasons, including:In many cases, the cause of a pneumothorax can't be determined. People with underlying lung disease, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, may be at increased risk of pneumothorax.Signs and symptoms of pneumothorax include:A doctor can confirm a diagnosis of pneumothorax by a chest X-ray. Occasionally, the air leak seals itself. Depending on the severity, a doctor can remove the air from the pleural space with a tube inserted between the ribs and attached to a suction device. Surgery may be needed when suction isn't effective or for recurrent pneumothorax.If air continues to enter the pleural space, tension pneumothorax occurs. The large amount of air may push the center of the chest (mediastinum) toward the other lung, compressing it. This is life-threatening and requires immediate insertion of a chest tube between the ribs to relieve the increased pressure."
Are there any new developments in the treatment of POEMS syndrome?,"The most important development in the treatment of POEMS syndrome — a rare multisystem disorder — is the benefit from a combination of high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. This combination treatment may not be appropriate for all people with POEMS syndrome. But it shows great promise as a new therapeutic option for people with POEMS syndrome.The term POEMS is an acronym for the disorder's most common symptoms:POEMS syndrome typically affects men older than age 50. It is so rare that it often goes undiagnosed or is misdiagnosed as multiple myeloma or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The exact cause of POEMS syndrome isn't clear. But researchers believe it involves an overgrowth of bone marrow cells (plasma cells), which produce chemicals that damage other parts of the body.Treatment for POEMS syndrome may include:"

		Are poinsettia plants poisonous?
	","
Contrary to popular belief, poinsettia plants are not poisonous. 

Contact with the sap of a poinsettia plant may cause a mild, itchy rash. If this happens, wash the affected area with soap and water and apply a cool compress to ease itching. 

Eating the leaves or stems of a poinsettia plant may cause a mild stomachache, vomiting or diarrhea — but severe signs and symptoms are unlikely. If you find a child eating a poinsettia plant, clear his or her mouth and move the plant out of reach. 

Of course, some people are more sensitive to poinsettia plants than are others. Reactions to poinsettia plants are more common among people who have latex allergies, for example, since latex and poinsettia plants share several proteins. In case of a severe reaction, seek prompt medical attention.

What is polycythemia vera?,"Polycythemia vera is a rare blood disorder in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells and occasionally too many white blood cells and platelets. This interferes with normal blood flow, which can lead to blood clots, heart attacks or strokes. The cause of polycythemia vera isn't known. But other causes of an increased red blood cell count include smoking, living at a high altitude and congenital heart conditions.Polycythemia vera occurs most often in older adults. The disease usually develops slowly. Many people have no symptoms for years. Others may experience nonspecific symptoms, such as:Because polycythemia vera initially causes no signs or symptoms, it is often found incidentally on blood tests done for some other reason.There is no cure for polycythemia vera. Treatment is directed at reducing the number of red blood cells and controlling signs and symptoms. Treatment may include:Most people with polycythemia vera live for many years with proper medical care. However, polycythemia may lead to acute myelogenous leukemia."
What can you tell me about polyglandular autoimmune syndromes?,"Polyglandular autoimmune syndromes (PAS) are a group of disorders in which multiple endocrine glands secrete insufficient or excess amounts of hormones. The cause of PAS isn't known, but genetics may play a role. Endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal glands, the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, and the ovaries and testes.In polyglandular autoimmune syndromes, the immune system mistakenly attacks the endocrine system. Signs and symptoms depend on which glands are affected. A doctor may make a diagnosis by blood tests, which measure hormone output by the affected glands. There is no cure for these syndromes. Treatment is directed at managing the signs and symptoms and usually includes hormone replacement therapy."

		Can a gluten-free diet help reduce signs and symptoms of polymyositis?
	","
Polymyositis (pol-e-mi-o-SI-tis) is a rare muscle disease that usually affects adults. A few studies that looked at small numbers of people with polymyositis over a number of years found that a gluten-free diet was linked to symptom reduction.

Without stronger evidence, though, having polymyositis doesn't mean you need to eliminate gluten from your diet — unless you also have celiac disease, which may be more common in people with polymyositis than in the general population. 

In celiac disease, an abnormal immune system reaction keeps your small intestine from absorbing gluten, which is a protein in wheat, rye and barley. Eating these grains invariably causes digestive distress, as does eating processed foods containing gluten. A gluten-free diet is the basic requirement for living with celiac disease.

If you have polymyositis and you develop persistent iron deficiency anemia with weight loss and frequent bouts of diarrhea, your doctor may recommend testing for celiac disease.

"A friend told me about a ""sunscreen pill"" that supposedly prevents sunburn. What is it? Does it really work?","The ""sunscreen pill"" you describe likely is Polypodium leucotomos extract, which is an herbal supplement marketed under the name Heliocare. This extract — which comes from a tropical, fern-like plant — has been used for many years in other countries to prevent sunburn and associated skin damage.In addition to anecdotal evidence, three small studies have suggested that Polypodium leucotomos extract reduces the severity of sunburn. However, these trials were too small to have detected any possible side effects — meaning that the long-term safety of these extracts is still in question.More definitive trials are needed to test both the effectiveness and safety of Polypodium leucotomos extract. It's important to note that this supplement is meant to be used in conjunction with — and not in place of — other sun protection measures, such as wearing sunscreen or protective clothing when outside."

		Is it true that pomegranate juice may slow the growth of prostate cancer? How much should I drink?
	","
Some research suggests that drinking pomegranate juice may slow the progression of prostate cancer.

For example, in one study, the length of time it took for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to double after surgery or radiation for prostate cancer was significantly longer in men who drank 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of pomegranate juice daily for up to two years. A longer PSA doubling time indicates that the cancer may be progressing less rapidly. Other studies have found that certain compounds in pomegranate juice inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells in the laboratory.

Although these results are encouraging, they're only preliminary. Clinical trials are under way, and it's too early to say if pomegranate juice can definitely slow the growth of prostate cancer. It's also unclear whether drinking pomegranate juice alters the course of prostate cancer overall so that men live longer or better.

If you choose to drink pomegranate juice, talk with your doctor first. Although pomegranate juice is generally safe, there is evidence that it affects the metabolism of several prescription medications, including the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin) and some drugs used to treat high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

		Can drinking pomegranate juice help lower my cholesterol?
	","
It's unclear whether drinking pomegranate juice can lower cholesterol. But, it's thought that pomegranate juice could block or slow the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries when you have persistent, elevated levels of fats (lipids) in your blood and other risk factors associated with heart disease.

Like many fruit juices, pomegranate juice contains antioxidants, especially polyphenols. What's more, pomegranate juice contains antioxidants at higher levels than do other fruit juices. Antioxidants are thought to provide several heart-protecting benefits, including reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol.

Pomegranate juice is generally safe to drink if certain facts are first considered. If you choose to drink pomegranate juice, check the label to be sure that you're drinking pure pomegranate juice, and not a mixture of juices that contains added sugar. The sugar adds more calories to the juice, which reduces its heart-health benefits. 

As you should do with any herbal or dietary supplement, talk to your doctor about pomegranate juice before you start drinking it regularly as a supplement. Pomegranate juice may cause dangerous side effects when it interacts with certain prescription medications, such as the blood thinner warfarin (Coumadin) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, including captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec) and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), and others.

Can poppy seeds cause a false positive on a drug test?,"Poppy seeds contain morphine. If you eat poppy seeds, you will excrete morphine in your urine, which may result in a positive urine test for opiates. However, the morphine level in your urine after eating poppy seeds is very low — typically below the detection threshold for most drug screening tests — and the morphine is usually cleared from your body within four hours.To avoid any problems, don't eat poppy seeds before a drug test. If you are required to provide a urine sample after recently eating poppy seeds, tell the person collecting the sample or the doctor overseeing the testing that you recently ate poppy seeds and to take that into account.By the way, the amount of morphine in poppy seeds is extremely low, so they won't give you a morphine ""high"" — no matter how many you eat."
What is porphyria?,"Porphyria is a group of inherited disorders caused by the abnormal production of a substance in the body called heme. Most types of porphyria are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means a child needs to inherit the defective gene from only one parent to develop the disease.Heme is found in all body tissues but especially in the liver and red blood cells. Multiple enzymes are required for your body to convert chemical compounds called porphyrins into heme. If any of the enzymes are abnormal, the process cannot continue and porphyrins may build up in the body and be excreted in the urine or stool.Signs and symptoms of porphyria depend on which specific enzymes are affected but often involve the nervous system or skin. Two major types include:A diagnosis of porphyria may be confirmed by special blood, urine or stool tests that measure enzyme levels. There is no cure for porphyria. Treatment depends on the type of porphyria and may include heme therapy and medications to manage signs and symptoms. Severe attacks may require hospitalization."
What conditions — other than rheumatoid arthritis — can cause a positive rheumatoid factor test?,"Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are antibodies that attach to other antibodies and may trigger inflammation in the body. A positive rheumatoid factor test means that rheumatoid factor has been detected in your blood.

But other conditions also can cause a positive rheumatoid factor test, including:In addition, rheumatoid factor can also be detected in healthy people. It's important to discuss with your doctor the significance of a positive rheumatoid factor test in your specific situation."
How does postpartum depression in the mother affect her baby?,"It is important to keep in mind that postpartum depression is treatable, especially with a combination of medication and therapy. But if the mother's depression isn't treated promptly, her baby can be affected. Research shows that infants of depressed mothers are at increased risk of behavioral problems, emotional difficulties, and delays in growth and language development.About 10 percent of new mothers experience postpartum depression. The signs and symptoms — such as fatigue, mood swings, sleeping problems, sadness and anxiety — can be so strong that they interfere with daily tasks, including caring for an infant. Studies show that depressed mothers are less involved with their infant. They are also inconsistent in how they respond to their infant. They can be loving and attentive one minute and withdrawn the next.Often postpartum depression isn't recognized or treated because some normal post-pregnancy changes cause similar symptoms in new mothers. In addition, some women don't tell anyone about their symptoms because they feel embarrassed, ashamed or guilty about being depressed when they're supposed to be happy.However, early detection and treatment of postpartum depression is critical — not only for the mother but for the infant. The less exposure the infant has to the mother's depression, the lower the risk of long-term problems in the child. It helps if the father or another caregiver can assist in meeting the needs of the baby while the mom is depressed or recovering from depression."

		How long does postpartum thyroiditis usually last?
	","
Postpartum thyroiditis — a painless inflammation of the thyroid gland that develops within the first year after childbirth — often lasts from several weeks to several months. For some women, postpartum thyroiditis leads to long-term underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). 

The cause of this uncommon condition isn't known. You may be at increased risk of postpartum thyroiditis if you have an immune system disorder, type 1 diabetes or a history of thyroiditis. 

At first, the release of thyroid hormone and the related inflammation may cause signs and symptoms similar to those of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), including: 

A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism can be confirmed with blood tests. Treatment generally isn't needed for mild signs and symptoms. If necessary, beta blockers may help reduce signs and symptoms — although beta blockers aren't recommended for women who are breast-feeding. 

Later, as thyroid cells become impaired by the inflammation, signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop, including: 

As with hyperthyroidism, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be confirmed with blood tests. Treatment generally isn't needed for mild signs and symptoms. If signs and symptoms are severe, thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be prescribed. 

For the majority of women, thyroid function eventually returns to normal. However, some women who develop postpartum thyroiditis develop hypothyroidism and require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Because hypothyroidism presents a significant risk to developing babies, it's important to make sure the condition is under control before attempting another pregnancy.

Can a person with post-traumatic stress disorder also have psychosis?,"Some people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may also have symptoms of psychosis, including hearing or seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations) and paranoia.Other symptoms of PTSD may appear to be psychotic but aren't. Rarely, a person with PTSD may experience dissociative states, which last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days. During these episodes, also called flashbacks, the person relives the events that triggered the PTSD. Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from hallucinations and delusions that may be present in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders."

		How can I help a loved one with post-traumatic stress?
	","
You can take steps to help a loved one cope with stress brought on by a traumatic event, whether it's a result of an accident, violence of any kind — such as an assault; verbal, physical, domestic or sexual abuse; or military combat — or another type of trauma.

A person with acute stress disorder (ASD) has stress symptoms during the first month after the traumatic event. If your loved one has symptoms that last longer than a month and make it hard to go about daily routines, go to work or school, or handle important tasks, he or she could have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

Whether your loved one has ASD or PTSD, assessment and counseling (psychotherapy) by a professional can make a critical difference in recovery. Encourage him or her to talk to a doctor or trained mental health provider.

You can also help through supportive listening — without attempts to ""fix"" the situation. 

Coping with traumatic stress is an ongoing process. You might have many conversations with your loved one over weeks or months as he or she processes the traumatic experience during or after a period of professional care.

You'll be of more help to your loved one if you learn about ASD and PTSD from trusted medical sources and encourage your loved one to follow treatment recommendations.

		Prednisone withdrawal: Why do I need to slowly taper down the dosage?
	","
Prednisone is similar to cortisol, a hormone naturally made by your adrenal glands. If you take prednisone for more than a few weeks, your adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. A gradual reduction in prednisone dosage gives your adrenal glands time to resume their normal function. 

If you abruptly stop taking the drug or taper off too quickly, you might experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms: 

The amount of time it takes to taper off prednisone depends on the disease being treated, the dose and duration of use, and other medical considerations. A full recovery can take anywhere from a week to several months. If you experience prednisone withdrawal symptoms as you are tapering off the drug, contact your doctor.

		What's the best way to treat pregnancy acne?
	","
You have many options for treating acne during pregnancy, including self-care and medication.

Pregnancy acne isn't a special form of acne. Many women simply seem to have trouble with acne during pregnancy. Although it isn't always clear what causes acne to get worse during pregnancy, the likely culprit for most women is an overproduction of oil (sebum) — which happens when certain hormones go into overdrive. Fortunately, you're not at the mercy of your hormones.

To treat pregnancy acne, start with self-care:

Medication is a second line of treatment for pregnancy acne. Any medication that's applied to your skin or swallowed can enter your bloodstream, so it's important to exercise caution during pregnancy — even with over-the-counter products.

Erythromycin (Erygel) is often the drug of choice for pregnancy acne. Azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea) may be another option. Both medications are typically applied to the skin as a lotion or gel and are available by prescription.

Opinions about using benzoyl peroxide to treat pregnancy acne are mixed. There's little research on the safety of over-the-counter or prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide during pregnancy, although problems haven't been reported. In addition, any medication that could potentially cause birth defects — including isotretinoin and other retinoids, as well as minocycline, doxycycline and other tetracyclines — is generally avoided during pregnancy.

If you're concerned about pregnancy acne, consult your dermatologist or the health care provider who's handling your pregnancy. Together you can weigh the benefits and risks of various treatment options.

		What can you tell me about pregnancy after gastric bypass surgery? I'm worried that my baby won't get enough nutrients since I won't be able to eat as much.
	","
It's possible to have a safe and healthy pregnancy after gastric bypass surgery. In fact, research suggests that pregnancy after weight-loss surgery might be safer for both mother and baby than pregnancy complicated by obesity.

Although more research is needed, studies suggest that weight-loss surgery might protect obese women and their babies from obesity-related problems during pregnancy. Examples include gestational diabetes, high blood pressure and preeclampsia — high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Timing is important, however. It's best to avoid pregnancy after weight-loss surgery until your weight stabilizes — typically at least 12 months after surgery. Rapid or persistent weight loss might deprive a growing baby of important nutrients, leading to low birth weight.

If you've had weight-loss surgery and are considering pregnancy, consult your health care provider for preconception planning. Depending on the type of weight-loss surgery and your specific nutritional needs, your health care provider might recommend certain nutritional supplements — such as folic acid, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, iron and calcium — in addition to a daily prenatal vitamin before and during pregnancy.

You might also consult a registered dietitian for advice on nutrition and weight gain during pregnancy.

		Is it safe to take stool softeners to treat pregnancy constipation?
	","
Stool softeners are generally considered safe during pregnancy.

Pregnancy constipation can be stubborn and seriously uncomfortable. Stool softeners, such as Colace, moisten the stool and make it easier to pass. The active ingredients in these products aren't absorbed by the body, so they're unlikely to have an adverse effect on a developing baby. Check with your health care provider, however, before taking any medication — including stool softeners and other types of laxatives — to treat pregnancy constipation.

Also, remember that pregnancy constipation can often be prevented with lifestyle changes. For example:

If you take iron supplements, mention the constipation to your health care provider. Although iron is an important nutrient during pregnancy, too much iron can contribute to pregnancy constipation.

If you haven't had a bowel movement in three days, ask your health care provider for a recommendation. If your health care provider approves stool softeners or other types of laxatives, be careful to use them as directed.

The term ""pregorexia"" refers to a woman's drive to control pregnancy weight gain through extreme dieting and exercise. 

Although health care providers don't uniformly recognize the term, the behavior associated with pregorexia is real and could harm a baby's health. Still, pregorexia is exceedingly rare. Far more women gain too much, rather than too little, weight during pregnancy. 

No matter what the scale says, however, some women do excessively worry about their weight gain and experience body image issues during pregnancy. The risk of pregorexia might be higher for women who have a history of eating disorders and those who have a weak social support system. 

Specific warning signs of pregorexia might include: 

If you're pregnant and struggling with your body image, share your concerns with your health care provider. 

Your health care provider can help you determine an appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, based on your pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index. He or she can also explain how to use healthy lifestyle habits and proper nutrition to control weight gain during pregnancy. 

It might be helpful to consult a registered dietitian or a mental health provider as well.

Prehypertension often progresses to established high blood pressure (hypertension) over time. But you can prevent or delay this progression by making the following lifestyle changes:Part of eating a healthy diet is reducing sodium intake. Many people find this difficult to do — because they miss the taste of salt in the foods they eat. But a recent study of 608 people in China suggests that using a reduced-sodium substitute — which also contained potassium and magnesium — for cooking and eating lowered blood pressure without sacrificing taste.The findings, which were reported at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2006, described a 5.4 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure in study participants who used the reduced-sodium substitute. This drop in blood pressure was maintained for 12 months while using the reduced-sodium substitute. Study participants noted no difference in taste or acceptability of the food using the substitute.The reduced-sodium substitute used in the study is commercially available in China. A product called Cardia Salt — which is similar to but not identical to the product used in the China study — is available in the United States. Similar products may also be available in other countries.Using a reduced-sodium substitute lowers your daily intake of salt and delays the development of high blood pressure. However, keep in mind that most of the sodium in your diet comes from processed foods. So it's important to also reduce the amount of processed foods you eat."

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe, sometimes disabling form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Although regular PMS and PMDD both have physical and emotional symptoms, PMDD causes extreme mood shifts that can disrupt your work and damage your relationships. About 30 percent of menstruating women have PMS. Up to 8 percent of women with PMS have symptoms that meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD.

In both PMDD and PMS, symptoms occur in the last week of the menstrual cycle and usually improve within a few days after menstruation begins. Both PMDD and PMS may also cause bloating, breast tenderness, fatigue, and changes in sleep and eating habits. In PMDD, however, the following emotional and behavioral symptoms stand out:

The cause of PMDD isn't clear. Underlying depression and anxiety are common in both PMS and PMDD, so it's possible that the normal physical changes that trigger a menstrual period somehow exacerbate mood disorders.

Treatment of PMDD is directed at preventing or minimizing symptoms and may include:

It's important that you review your symptoms with your doctor. A thorough medical evaluation can determine if symptoms are due to PMDD or some other condition. If you are diagnosed with PMDD, your doctor can recommend specific treatments to help minimize the impact PMDD has on the days you experience symptoms.

		As I get older, it takes longer for my eyes to adjust when I change focus on close-up work and look into the distance. I notice for a short while that distant objects appear blurry. What causes this?
	","
The focusing problem you describe may be an early symptom of presbyopia, an age-related change in vision. Presbyopia is not the same as farsightedness. In presbyopia, your eyes gradually lose the ability to adjust to see objects clearly at different distances. Although the most common presbyopic symptom is blurry close-up vision, you may also experience blurred distance vision when changing your focus from near to far objects.

If you're experiencing this problem after prolonged close-up work, such as reading or working at a computer, try resting your eyes every 10 to 20 minutes by closing them for 20 to 30 seconds. This may help minimize the symptoms. If you don't normally wear prescription glasses, you may consider getting a pair of nonprescription reading glasses that can be used for close-up work.

If you're concerned about these vision changes, make an appointment with your eye doctor. An eye exam can identify potential eye or vision problems that may require further evaluation and treatment.

"What does it mean when a drug is prescribed for an ""off-label use""? Is this legal?","""Off-label use"" means that a prescription drug is being prescribed for a purpose not listed on the product's label. This is a common and acceptable practice by doctors. When done under a doctor's care, off-label use of prescription drugs is legal and may be vital for optimal care in many disorders.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows off-label use for prescription drugs it has already approved for marketing. This is permitted because the FDA approval process for any new prescription drug is very comprehensive. Rigorous testing is required to determine if a drug is safe and if it actually works for the disease or condition for which it is approved.The drug approval process is expensive and lengthy — often taking years for a drug to be thoroughly studied. For this reason, it is often not practical for the manufacturer to study more than a single use of a drug. This is why manufacturers typically market new medications for one specific condition.After approval by the FDA, it is not uncommon for research on a drug to continue. Over time, doctors and scientists may find that the drug is useful for additional conditions. If such a use is discovered, but doesn't go through the FDA approval process, the drug's manufacturer is not allowed to advertise or promote the drug for the new use. But doctors and researchers are allowed to share such information with each other and the public.Off-label use is up to a doctor's discretion. It is your doctor's responsibility to be well-informed about a drug before prescribing it for off-label use. This includes knowing about potential side effects and drug interactions. But it is also important to follow your doctor's instructions. Don't take larger doses or use the medication more often than prescribed. Report any side effects to your doctor."
What causes primary alveolar hypoventilation?,"Primary alveolar hypoventilation is a rare disorder in which inadequate breathing — either too shallow or too slow — leads to respiratory failure in people with normal lungs and airways. The exact cause isn't known. But it may be due to a problem in the part of the brain that controls breathing.When you inhale, air travels to your lungs through two major airways. These airways subdivide into smaller airways that finally end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli). Within these air sacs are tiny blood vessels where oxygen is added to your blood and carbon dioxide is removed. In alveolar hypoventilation, your lungs don't take in enough air for this exchange to occur properly. This results in reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide in your blood. The condition typically worsens at night.Primary alveolar hypoventilation occurs most often in men between the ages of 20 and 50. Signs and symptoms may include:The only way to confirm a diagnosis of this condition is with arterial blood gas analysis, which measures oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood. Treatment may include:"
What is primary lateral sclerosis?,"Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a rare, slowly progressive, neurological disorder of unknown cause.

As the disease worsens over many years, it can lead to balance problems and falls. It can also be associated with pain.Because primary lateral sclerosis resembles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it is sometimes misdiagnosed as ALS. But unlike ALS, primary lateral sclerosis affects only the upper motor neurons in the brain and not the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord — so it doesn't cause the muscle wasting (atrophy) seen in ALS. Also, primary lateral sclerosis isn't fatal.A doctor may make a diagnosis of primary lateral sclerosis based on:There is no specific treatment for primary lateral sclerosis.

Attacks of Prinzmetal's angina are brief but painful and occur most often at night.The cause of Prinzmetal's angina is a coronary artery spasm, in which the walls of the artery briefly narrow (constrict). This temporarily reduces or obstructs blood flow to the heart muscle, resulting in chest pain. Coronary artery spasms can be associated with atherosclerosis.Treatment of Prinzmetal's angina is directed at the underlying cause, such as atherosclerosis, and may include calcium channel blockers.

But it may be due to a spasm in the muscles around the rectum. On physical examination, there may be tenderness of the pelvic floor muscles. Although many treatments for proctalgia fugax have been tried, none has been consistently effective. During an attack, rectal pain may be relieved by warm baths, biofeedback and massage of the muscles supporting the rectum. A doctor with experience in treating proctalgia fugax can provide instruction on self-care treatments. Constipation may contribute to proctalgia fugax. So it is important to eat plenty of fiber."
Is progesterone safe for treating severe hot flashes in women who have had breast cancer?,"Progesterone therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for hot flashes. But it's not clear if progesterone is safe for women who have had breast cancer.More than half of all women experience hot flashes during menopause. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes. But it generally is not recommended for women who have had breast cancer, due to concerns that estrogen may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence.As an alternative to estrogen, some doctors prescribe progesterone alone to control hot flashes. One such progesterone treatment is megestrol acetate (Megace). This hormone is nearly as effective as estrogen therapy in reducing hot flashes and has been studied in women with breast cancer. Other effective progesterone treatments include medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) — a hormone commonly used for contraception — and progesterone creams.In women who have had breast cancer, the concern about progesterone is whether it may increase the risk of cancer recurrence — especially in women with hormone-receptive tumors. More research is needed to evaluate the safety of progesterone therapy for hot flashes in women who have had breast cancer.If hot flashes are debilitating and all other nonhormonal therapies have been ineffective, it may be worth discussing the use of progesterone therapy with your doctor. You'll need to weigh the benefits of reducing hot flashes against the unknown risk of breast cancer recurrence with this treatment."

		Is prolotherapy an effective treatment for chronic low back pain?
	","
Prolotherapy is a complementary treatment for muscle and joint pain. The treatment involves repeated injections of an irritant solution into part of a joint — the joint's interior, for example, or a supporting tendon or ligament. The irritant, usually a sugar solution, is thought to trigger growth in the connective tissue of the joint, eventually leading to reduced pain.

Studies of prolotherapy in people with low back pain have had mixed results. A combination of prolotherapy and spinal manipulation or back exercises seems to be more effective than is prolotherapy alone.

The American Pain Society recommends against prolotherapy for treating low back pain, but other authorities are suspending judgment until larger, more-thorough studies have been done. Until then, talk to your doctor before deciding whether prolotherapy is right for you.

		My prostate cancer is being treated with radioactive seeds (brachytherapy). What precautions should I take during and after prostate cancer brachytherapy?
	","
You may need to take some precautions, but it depends on the type of prostate cancer brachytherapy you receive. Prostate cancer brachytherapy is designed to treat prostate cancer by delivering radiation treatment to only the prostate. This is done by implanting radioactive ""seeds"" containing your treatment inside your prostate gland. 

Prostate cancer brachytherapy can be done with different types of radioactive seeds. The amount of radiation released by the seeds and the duration of treatment depend on the type of seeds used. The lifetime radiation exposure to family members of men receiving prostate cancer brachytherapy is very low and doesn't exceed the annual limit set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although the seeds remain in the prostate for the rest of your life, the amount of radiation released by them decreases with time and eventually becomes negligible. 

Your radiation oncologist can provide detailed information about the specific treatment used. Recommendations for the first two months after seed implantation may include: 

If you travel to foreign countries, you may encounter radiation detectors at some border security checkpoints. Consider carrying a card from your radiation oncologist indicating that you have had a prostate seed implant.

		Does my choice of initial prostate cancer treatment preclude other treatments later on?
	","
Generally speaking, no. But first, some background information. 

Selecting the right treatment for prostate cancer depends on many factors. They include your overall health, your age, the size and spread of the cancer, the aggressiveness of your cancer, and how you feel about the potential side effects of treatment. Treatment options include: 

Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. 

Which initial treatment you choose may not affect a later treatment choice, should it be needed because of recurring cancer. However, prostatectomy after radiation therapy or cryosurgery (salvage prostatectomy) is performed in only very select cases because of the significantly increased risk of fecal and urinary incontinence. How widespread the recurring cancer is also plays a role in considering salvage prostatectomy. 

Although salvage prostatectomy can be performed at specialized medical centers, it is often an option of last resort and determined on a case-by-case basis. In general, prostatectomy is not an option for men who have previously received radiation therapy or cryosurgery, and other treatments, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), may be tried before a salvage prostatectomy.

Is it possible to transmit prostate cancer to my wife through semen?,"No. Prostate cancer cannot be passed from one person to another through semen. Cancer itself is not contagious — even through intimate contact, such as kissing, intercourse or oral sex.Although the prostate gland makes semen, cancer cells cannot be transmitted via semen. To test this theory, scientists have tried to grow prostate cancer cells from semen — but have been unsuccessful.In addition, cancer cells from one person's body simply can't start growing in another person's body. According to the American Cancer Society, all cells are fragile and require the proper conditions to survive. Also, the other person's immune system would recognize the cancer cells as foreign invaders and destroy them.Certain sexually transmitted viral or bacterial infections increase the risk of some types of cancer. But no one can ""catch"" cancer from another person."

		Can prostate cancer spread to the pancreas?
	","
Prostate cancer is cancer of the walnut-shaped gland in males that produces the fluid that nourishes and transports sperm (seminal fluid). Prostate cancer usually grows slowly. If prostate cancer spreads, it tends to affect the bones and lymph nodes. Spread of prostate cancer to the pancreas is rare. However, it's possible for an advanced case of prostate cancer to spread to any organ — including the pancreas. 

Treatment for prostate cancer that has spread may include hormone therapy, radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

		I read that prostate cancer may grow slowly because prostate-specific antigen (PSA) keeps it in check. If so, do men with higher PSA levels have a better prognosis than men with lower PSA levels?
	","
In most cases, a higher PSA level does not mean a better prognosis, and actually the opposite is true. PSA does not keep prostate cancer ""in check,"" but rather it is a measure of the cancer. Only in rare cases where mutated and aggressive cancers occur are low or normal PSA levels found. 

PSA is a protein made by prostate tissue. Men with prostate cancer often have elevated PSA levels because the cancer cells make excessive amounts of this protein. 

At the time of initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, the PSA level helps determine how likely it is that the cancer has spread (metastasized). It also helps determine how likely the cancer will be cured with treatment such as radiation or surgery. Generally, the higher your PSA level and the faster the rate at which it increases, the more prostate cancer cells you have in your body. 

But this isn't always true. In some cases, the PSA level may not be elevated, despite the presence of prostate cancer. In such cases, the cancer cells often have more genetic mutations than other prostate cancer cells do, and they don't have the ability to make PSA. This type of prostate cancer is usually more aggressive and doesn't respond well to treatment. Some scientists believe that the genetic mutations in these cancer cells may allow such cancers to grow and spread more quickly. 

Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. The reasons for this aren't clear. Discuss the results of your PSA test with your doctor.

		Should I avoid sex if I have prostatitis? Does sex make the condition worse?
	","
You don't necessarily have to avoid sex if you have prostatitis — an infection or inflammation of the prostate gland. Typically, sex won't worsen prostatitis, but it won't make it better, either.

While it's OK for most men with prostatitis to have sex, some men have pain during or after orgasm (ejaculation). This can interfere with the enjoyment of sex.

Prostatitis is frequently caused by bacterial infections, but it's usually not caused by something that can be passed on to your partner during sex. In rare cases, prostatitis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Don't have sex until you see your doctor if you have any signs of an STI, such as sores on your genitals or abnormal discharge from your penis.

To relieve prostatitis pain, try soaking in a warm bath. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), also may help, unless your doctor has told you to avoid these medications. You may need prescription medication to treat the underlying cause of your prostatitis.

Prostatitis — and other conditions with similar symptoms — have a number of possible causes. Some of them can have serious consequences if they aren't treated. If you have pelvic pain, difficult or painful urination, or painful ejaculation, see your doctor.

My husband had a kidney transplant about six years ago. Recent testing detected protein in his urine. Does this mean he has chronic kidney disease again?,"No, protein in the urine after a kidney transplant doesn't necessarily mean that chronic kidney disease is imminent. But it does indicate the need for a thorough medical evaluation, including a blood pressure measurement, a review of current medications, and a review of past and present results of kidney function and urine tests. If protein in the urine has definitely increased, your husband's doctor may recommend a biopsy of the transplanted kidney to more accurately determine the health of the kidney and further treatment options, if necessary."
Our son just had his sports physical. His doctor said he had elevated levels of protein in his urine. Should we be concerned? ,"Small increases in urine protein are rarely a cause for concern. Typically, if a urine test shows a slight increase in protein, the doctor asks for a second urine sample. For the second sample, the doctor may request morning urine, which usually contains the least amount of protein. The doctor may also recommend a 24-hour urine sample, in which all urine from one morning to the following morning is collected, to quantify its protein content. During the 24-hour urine collection, it's important that your son strictly limit his physical activity.Large amounts of protein in the urine may indicate a serious kidney problem. Normally, the body is very efficient in minimizing the amount of protein loss in the urine.If a urine test shows a high level of protein loss in the urine, a doctor may recommend other tests — such as a urine analysis and a measurement of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance — to check kidney function. If you have concerns about your son's test results, ask his doctor for more information."

		I'm trying to lose weight. Could protein shakes help?
	","
Manufacturers of protein shakes may claim that their products help decrease body fat or promote weight loss, but protein shakes aren't a magic bullet for weight loss.

Replacing certain meals with protein shakes may help you reduce your daily calories, which can help you lose weight. If you rely on protein shakes to replace regular meals, however, you'll miss out on the nutritional benefits of whole foods. And since protein contains calories, consuming too much protein can actually make losing weight more difficult — especially if you drink protein shakes in addition to your usual diet. 

The average adult needs 46 to 56 grams of protein a day, depending on weight and overall health. As long as you're eating a healthy diet, adding extra protein — either through protein shakes or other sources — isn't necessary.

Remember, the key to losing weight is burning more calories than you consume. Choose healthy foods — such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean sources of protein — and include physical activity in your daily routine.

		What causes PSA levels to increase after prostate removal due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?
	","
Increased levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in your blood can be a sign of prostate cancer. However, cancer is just one of several possible causes of increased PSA.

It's normal for prostate tissue to release small amounts of PSA into your bloodstream. When the prostate grows, PSA levels increase. When the prostate is removed, PSA levels fall close to zero. Many procedures for enlarged prostate remove only part of the prostate, which partially decreases PSA levels. After any of these enlarged prostate procedures, a number of things can cause PSA levels to go up again. They include:

If you have elevated PSA levels after surgery for enlarged prostate, your doctor may recommend a wait-and-see approach — advising you to retake the PSA test after two or three months. If your doctor suspects prostatitis, you may be prescribed antibiotics to cure the infection. If a second test shows high PSA levels, your doctor may recommend additional tests, such as other blood tests, urine tests or ultrasounds tests. If cancer is suspected, you may need a biopsy to check remaining prostate tissue.

"My 75-year-old father recently had a physical exam, and his doctor told him it was no longer necessary to have his PSA level checked. Is this true?","The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is most often used to screen for prostate cancer. The need for a PSA test depends on many factors, including a man's age and general health.The American Urological Association recommends an annual PSA test for all men age 50 and older who have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and for men age 40 and older who are at increased risk of prostate cancer. However, men older than age 75 may not benefit from a PSA test. Here's why. Prostate cancer typically grows slowly and causes no symptoms. Treating prostate cancer in a man older than 75 years may not lengthen his lifespan. Yet, the treatment itself has many potential risks and side effects.There are exceptions to this general recommendation. Men age 75 and older who are in excellent health and have a significant life expectancy may still benefit from a PSA test. The need for the test depends on the individual situation.Before having your PSA checked, it's important to understand the potential benefits and limitations of this test. The PSA test can't tell the difference between prostate cancer and other prostate problems. If an abnormal PSA level is detected, further testing — usually expensive and invasive testing such as a prostate biopsy — may be required to rule out cancer.Although the PSA test is most often used as a screening test for prostate cancer, it may also be used to evaluate and manage other prostate problems."

		What causes a pseudoaneurysm? Should a pseudoaneurysm always be treated?
	","
A pseudoaneurysm, sometimes called a false aneurysm, is a dilated artery or blood vessel. A pseudoaneurysm can form after an artery or heart chamber is injured causing blood to leak and pool outside the artery's wall. In a true aneurysm, the artery or vessel is enlarged, but the enlargement doesn't result from an injury and blood flows normally through the aneurysm. 

A pseudoaneurysm may be a complication of cardiac catheterization, a procedure in which a catheter is inserted in an artery in your groin (femoral artery) and is threaded through your blood vessels to your heart. Cardiac catheterization is used to capture images of your heart to diagnose heart disease and to treat certain types of heart disease. A pseudoaneurysm can occur if blood leaks and pools outside your femoral artery where it was punctured when the catheter was inserted. Pseudoaneurysms can also occur in other arteries throughout the body related to either surgery or trauma, or from the rupture of an aneurysm. 

Pseudoaneurysms can also occur in the heart chambers, such as the left ventricle, after damage from a heart attack causes blood to leak and pool outside the injured heart muscle. 

If a pseudoaneurysm of a femoral artery related to cardiac catheterization is small, it may go undetected and not cause any complications. But if a small pseudoaneurysm is detected, your doctor may recommend a watchful-waiting approach to see if it resolves on its own. However, most often, when a femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is detected, your doctor will recommend one of these treatments:

		What is the difference between claudication and pseudoclaudication?
	","
Pseudoclaudication and claudication cause similar symptoms — typically, lower limb pain while standing or walking — but for different reasons. 

Pseudoclaudication is a result of narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal (lumbar spinal stenosis). This puts pressure on the spinal nerve roots, which control movement and sensation in the lower limbs. Claudication, on the other hand, is a symptom of peripheral artery disease, a circulation problem that results in decreased blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to muscles below the waist. 

Pseudoclaudication typically causes pain and discomfort in the buttocks, thighs, legs and feet with walking or prolonged standing. You may also experience numbness and weakness in your legs. The pain of pseudoclaudication typically is relieved by sitting or bending forward at the waist, which reduces nerve pressure. Treatment of pseudoclaudication is directed at reducing the spinal stenosis.

		Can changing my diet treat psoriasis?
	","
Although there’s no special psoriasis diet, some people find that certain foods worsen their symptoms, or that others improve skin inflammation. However, any link between nutrition and psoriasis is still unclear.

Psoriasis is cyclic, meaning that you experience periods when your psoriasis symptoms improve or go into remission alternating with times when your psoriasis becomes worse. Besides the food you eat, many factors might trigger a flare-up, including stress, an infection, climate changes or medications you're taking.

Though certain foods may neither improve nor aggravate your symptoms, eating a healthy diet overall is still beneficial. If you have psoriasis, you're encouraged to eat a diet that focuses on:

A number of studies also have shown that supplementing your diet with fish oil — which provides polyunsaturated fatty acids needed to maintain healthy skin — may improve symptoms.

A healthy diet, especially when combined with exercise, can help you lose weight and maintain a healthy weight — factors that may improve psoriasis symptoms. If you're overweight, losing weight may also improve the effectiveness of your psoriasis medication.

As long as you meet your daily nutritional requirements, there's no harm in exploring which foods might improve your symptoms. Start a food diary and record what you eat along with the symptoms you experience. Over time, you may see patterns that are helpful in controlling your psoriasis symptoms.

		Can fish oil supplements improve psoriasis symptoms?
	","
Psoriasis is less common in populations whose regular diet includes cold-water fish containing omega-3 fatty acids. But study results have been mixed as to whether fish oil supplements can reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling. The latest findings suggest that fish oil delivered intravenously reduces psoriasis symptoms better than fish oil supplements taken by mouth. 

Side effects of high-dose fish oil supplements can include a fishy aftertaste, heartburn and nausea. Dosages greater than 3 grams a day can affect blood clotting, increase your risk of bleeding and decrease blood pressure. This may be of particular concern if you're taking blood-thinning medication or high blood pressure medication.

Rarely, it may be caused by a parasitic infection.Pulmonary eosinophilia usually isn't serious. The main sign of this condition is a persistent cough. A doctor may make a diagnosis of pulmonary eosinophilia based on:In most cases, pulmonary eosinophilia improves without treatment, typically within a few months. When needed, treatment may include corticosteroids. If the underlying cause of pulmonary eosinophilia is a reaction to a medication, discontinuing the medication usually resolves the problem.A rare but serious complication of pulmonary eosinophilia is acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which may result in pulmonary failure.

		What is pulse pressure? How important is pulse pressure to your overall health?
	","
Blood pressure readings are given in two numbers. The top number is the maximum pressure your heart exerts while beating (systolic pressure), and the bottom number is the amount of pressure in your arteries between beats (diastolic pressure). The numeric difference between your systolic and diastolic blood pressure is called your pulse pressure. For example, if your resting blood pressure is 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), your pulse pressure is 40 — which is considered a normal and healthy pulse pressure. 

A high pulse pressure may be a strong predictor of heart problems, especially for older adults. Generally, a pulse pressure greater than 40 mm Hg is abnormal. A pulse pressure lower than 40 may mean you have poor heart function, while a higher pulse pressure may mean your heart's valves are leaky (valve regurgitation).

The most important cause of elevated pulse pressure is stiffness of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The stiffness may be due to high blood pressure or fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries (atherosclerosis). The greater your pulse pressure, the stiffer and more damaged the vessels are thought to be. Other conditions — including severe iron deficiency (anemia) and overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) — can increase pulse pressure as well. 

Treating high blood pressure usually reduces pulse pressure as well.

If the tube remains blocked, the kidney could stop working.In pyeloplasty, the narrowed part of the ureter is removed (excised) and the ureter is reconnected to the kidney. A stent is placed to allow healing and drainage of urine from the kidney. Less-invasive procedures also are available for removing a blockage. These include:"

		Is weight gain inevitable after you quit smoking? What causes it?
	","
It's fairly common to gain weight after you stop smoking, especially in the first few months — but it isn't inevitable. 

Smoking acts as an appetite suppressant and may slightly increase your metabolism as well. When you quit smoking, your appetite and metabolism return to normal — which may lead you to eat more and burn fewer calories. Also, your ability to smell and taste food improves after you quit smoking. This can make food more appealing, which may lead you to eat more. And if you substitute snacking for smoking, the calories may quickly add up. 

To avoid weight gain when you quit smoking, make diet and exercise part of your stop-smoking plan. It may help to:

Yes, Alzheimer's disease usually worsens slowly. But its speed of progression varies, depending on a person's genetic makeup, environmental factors, age at diagnosis and other medical conditions.

Still, anyone diagnosed with Alzheimer's who seems to be progressing quickly — or who experiences a sudden decline — should see his or her doctor. The doctor will look for complicating conditions or factors that can cause a rapid — but possibly reversible — progression of symptoms in someone with Alzheimer's disease.

		My 2-year-old son was diagnosed with reactive airway disease. Is this just a fancy term for asthma?
	","
Sometimes the terms ""reactive airway disease"" and ""asthma"" are used interchangeably. However, they're not necessarily the same thing. 

Reactive airway disease is a general term that doesn't indicate a specific diagnosis. It may be used to describe a history of coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath of unknown cause. These signs and symptoms may or may not be caused by asthma. Reactive airway disease isn't really a specific diagnosis. In fact, it's thought that some children are mistakenly given a diagnosis of reactive airway disease when they actually have asthma. 

Describing a condition as reactive airway disease in part reflects the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis of asthma in certain situations — such as during early childhood. Although it's possible for infants and toddlers to have asthma, tests to diagnose asthma generally aren't accurate before age 6.

		I think I have reactive hypoglycemia. How can I address my symptoms?
	","
Reactive hypoglycemia (or alimentary hypoglycemia) is low blood sugar that occurs after a meal — usually one to three hours after eating. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) usually occurs while fasting. Signs and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia may include hunger, weakness, shakiness, sleepiness, lightheadedness, anxiety and confusion. 

Reactive hypoglycemia is often difficult to diagnose, because it's possible to have symptoms that are similar to reactive hypoglycemia without actually having the condition. Generally, a medical evaluation is done to determine whether symptoms are caused by low blood sugar — and whether symptoms resolve once blood sugar returns to normal. Further evaluation of reactive hypoglycemia depends on the severity of signs and symptoms. 

For the majority of people, reactive hypoglycemia usually doesn't require medical treatment. It may help to pay attention to the timing and composition of your meals: 

For some, particularly those who have had intestinal surgery (gastric bypass or surgery for the management of ulcer disease) further evaluation by a doctor may be warranted, but dietary changes are still recommended.

Rectal prolapse also may recur."
"Since giving birth to my second child five years ago, I have suffered from chronic constipation. I often have to manually remove stool from my rectum by pushing it along with my finger through the inside of my vagina. What can I do?","The chronic constipation that you describe is likely due to a rectocele. A rectocele occurs when the front wall of the rectum bulges into your vagina. This forms a pocket just above your anus in which stool can become trapped. It makes perfect sense that you are able to push stool out in the way you have described — by pressing on the bulge on the inside of your vagina to release the trapped stool.Pregnancy and delivery are common causes of rectoceles. This is because the muscles and ligaments that hold and support your vagina become stretched and weakened during pregnancy, labor and delivery.Small rectoceles may cause no signs or symptoms and require no treatment. Large rectoceles may cause a noticeable bulging of tissue through the vaginal opening. When treatment of a rectocele is needed, self-care measures — such as increasing fiber in your diet and practicing Kegel exercises — are often effective. In severe cases, you many need surgical repair.Regardless of the cause, chronic constipation should be evaluated by a doctor."
"
		What are the treatment options for recurrent prostate infection?
	","
A recurring prostate infection is also known as chronic bacterial prostatitis. This type of prostate infection is caused by bacteria in the prostate gland. It's generally treated with antibiotics. A prostate infection may recur because antibiotics aren't able to get deep enough into the prostate tissue to destroy all of the bacteria, or because the antibiotic isn't effective against the type of bacterium that's causing the prostate infection.

To treat a prostate infection that doesn't get better with antibiotics or keeps coming back, you may need to:

If you're taking antibiotics, take them exactly as instructed, even if you feel better. Not taking the full course of antibiotics or missing doses can interfere with the antibiotic's ability to completely kill the bacteria.

If you have recurring prostate infections that don't improve with treatment, see a doctor who specializes in men's urinary and reproductive health (urologist). A urologist might obtain fluid from your prostate to determine the bacterium causing the problem and the antibiotic that is likely to work best. The urologist can also look for any prostate or urinary system problems that would make you more vulnerable to infection. Examples of conditions that increase your risk of recurrent prostate infections include kidney stones, bladder stones and trouble emptying your bladder all the way because of an enlarged prostate.

"
		I have end-stage kidney failure. I'm not on dialysis, but I do follow a special renal diet and I'm a vegetarian. What are the best sources of protein for someone like me who must also limit phosphorus and potassium?
	","
The answer depends on what type of vegetarian you are. It also depends on your level of kidney function and how restrictive you need to be with protein, phosphorus and potassium. 

A proper renal diet is an essential part of any treatment plan for chronic kidney disease. Although a renal diet limits protein, you still need to eat some high-quality protein every day. Your kidneys are responsible for preventing too much potassium and phosphorus from building up in your blood. Therefore, it's important to have the right amount of potassium and phosphorus in your diet in order to avoid overwhelming your kidneys' ability to maintain healthy levels. 

In general, dairy foods are the main sources of phosphorus in the diet. So by limiting or avoiding dairy products, you may be able to control blood-phosphorus levels. You can make up for dairy products by choosing milk and yogurt made from rice or soy-based products. 

The majority of potassium comes from fruits, vegetables and dairy products. So by limiting the dairy in your diet and keeping the amount of fruits and vegetables in check — and choosing ones that are lower in potassium — you can control blood-potassium levels. 

Because vegetarian sources of protein also contain varying amounts of potassium and phosphorus, you'll want to limit — or avoid — some of the foods in the table below. Your dietitian can provide you with information about which foods and how much you should eat each day. 

<strong>Note:</strong> Depending on your need to restrict sodium, avoid smoked fish, chicken and turkey, which are high in sodium. Look for unsalted varieties of canned tuna, salmon, chicken or turkey. In addition, because fresh poultry may be injected with sodium, look for ""natural"" on the label — which indicates no added sodium.

		How many C-sections can a woman safely have?
	","
Although there isn't enough research to support a specific limit on repeat C-sections, most women can safely have up to three cesarean deliveries. Each repeat C-section is generally more complicated than the last.

For some women, the risk of surgical complications — such as infection or heavy bleeding — increases only slightly from one C-section to the next. If you had a long and difficult labor before your first C-section, a repeat C-section might be less physically taxing. The healing process will take at least as long, however, and possibly longer if you develop complications.

For other women — such as those who have significant internal scarring or bands of scar-like tissue that cling to the uterus (adhesions) — the risk of each repeat C-section increases substantially.

Primary concerns with repeat C-sections include:

Repeat C-sections appeal to many women. Beyond three C-sections, however, the surgical risks must be weighed carefully against the desire for subsequent pregnancies.

		What can you tell me about Resperate? Does it really help lower blood pressure?
	","
Resperate is a portable electronic device that promotes slow, deep breathing. Resperate is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing stress and lowering blood pressure. It's available without a prescription. Resperate uses chest sensors to measure your breathing, and then a computerized unit creates a melody for you to use to synchronize your breathing. The melody is supposed to help you slow your breathing with long exhalations. 

Although studies on Resperate are ongoing, it appears Resperate can help lower your blood pressure in the short term. Researchers are still investigating whether using Resperate over the long term can create lasting effects on lowering your blood pressure. 

Resperate is intended to be used at least 15 minutes a day, three to four days a week. Within a few weeks, the deep-breathing exercises can help lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure — the top and bottom numbers in a blood pressure reading. You need to keep doing the breathing exercises to maintain the blood pressure lowering benefits. 

If you're considering using Resperate, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to tell you if breathing exercises may be helpful in lowering your blood pressure.

What is retinitis pigmentosa?,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the name for a group of inherited eye diseases characterized by poor night vision and a slow loss of side (peripheral) vision. The disorder may be caused by defects in a number of different genes, which result in progressive degeneration of the retina. Retinitis pigmentosa may eventually lead to blindness.Initially, retinitis pigmentosa damages the specialized cells in the retina that sense light. These cells are called rods and cones. But as the disease progresses, it may affect the entire retina. Signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa often first appear in childhood. But severe visual problems usually don't develop until early adulthood.A doctor may make a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa by:There is no effective treatment for retinitis pigmentosa. Treatment is usually directed at managing some of the other problems that may be associated with retinitis pigmentosa, such as macular degeneration and cataracts.Some research suggests that prolonged exposure of the retina to ultraviolet light may accelerate vision loss. So, the use of sunglasses may help preserve vision in a person with RP but it won't prevent RP. Also, recent studies indicate that treatment with antioxidants may slow the progression of the disease. However this treatment is controversial."

		How do you know if you have rhabdomyolysis from statin use?
	","
Although mild muscle pain is a relatively common side effect of statins, some people who take statin medications to lower their cholesterol may have severe muscle pain. This intense pain is a symptom of rhabdomyolysis (rab-do-mi-OL-ih-sis), a rare condition that causes muscle cells to break down.

The most common signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include:

The higher the dose of statins, the higher the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The risk also increases if certain drugs — including cyclosporine and gemfibrozil (Lopid) — are taken in combination with statins.

If you notice moderate or severe muscle aches after starting to take a statin, contact your doctor. If you have signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, stop taking your statin medication immediately and seek medical treatment right away. If necessary, your doctor may take steps to help prevent kidney damage and other complications.

		Can certain foods reduce rheumatoid arthritis symptoms?
	","
That's a million-dollar question. Despite years of study, no conclusive evidence exists to show that particular foods make rheumatoid arthritis symptoms flare up or decrease. Some research has shown a link between eating certain fish oils and reducing joint inflammation in people with rheumatoid arthritis, but more research is needed to assess this possible benefit.

It's smart to consider how your lifestyle might play a role in the ups and downs of rheumatoid arthritis. Being too heavy, for example, stresses your weight-bearing joints, increasing joint pain, stiffness and inflammation. 

You can also stay away from any food that seems to make your symptoms worse. But don't exclude whole food groups or large numbers of foods without consulting a registered dietitian or your doctor.

		What's new in the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity?
	","
An anti-cancer drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), is shaping up to be an effective alternative to laser surgery in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), an eye disease that affects many premature babies. 

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) generally affects preterm infants born before week 31 of pregnancy and weighing 2.75 pounds (1250 grams) or less at birth. In most cases, ROP resolves without treatment, causing no damage. Advanced ROP, however, can cause permanent vision problems or blindness. 

In ROP, blood vessels swell and overgrow in the light-sensitive layer of nerves at the back of the eye (retina). When the condition is advanced, the abnormal retinal vessels extend into the jelly-like substance (vitreous) that fills the center of the eye. Bleeding from these vessels may scar the retina and stress its attachment to the back of the eye, causing partial or complete retinal detachment. Laser surgery, the standard treatment for advanced ROP, saves sight in the main part of the visual field, but at the cost of side (peripheral) vision. Laser surgery also requires general anesthesia, which may be risky for preterm infants.

The new ROP treatment, bevacizumab, has Food and Drug Administration approval for treating certain cancers. The drug works by blocking the growth of blood vessels that tumors generate to sustain themselves. Bevacizumab is also widely used to curb the overgrowth of retinal blood vessels in two serious adult eye diseases, wet macular degeneration and advanced diabetic retinopathy. 

In a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a single bevacizumab eye injection to that of laser surgery in 150 preterm infants with ROP, the bevacizumab injection worked as well as did laser surgery. Blood vessels resumed normal growth throughout the retina in the babies who received bevacizumab. Because the bevacizumab-treated infants did not have laser surgery, their peripheral vision was less likely to be impaired. Also, fewer recurrences of ROP after treatment occurred in infants who received the injection than in those who had laser surgery.

Further research should help identify the ROP stage and level of severity most likely to benefit from bevacizumab injection. In a few reports, injecting the drug when the retina was already partially detached led to complete retinal detachment. Data about the long-term safety of bevacizumab in ROP also remain incomplete. Although bevacizumab doesn't seem to leak out of the retina, there is concern that the drug might slow down the formation of normal blood vessels in other parts of a baby's body. The studies done so far have not shown this effect, but more research and follow-up are needed to determine which ROP treatment is best for a given patient.

		What causes runner's diarrhea? And what can I do about it?
	","
Runner's diarrhea is characterized by frequent, loose bowel movements during or immediately after a run. Runner's diarrhea is most common in long-distance or marathon runners. 

The cause of runner's diarrhea isn't clear. One theory is that extreme exercise directs blood flow away from the intestines — contributing to diarrhea. 

Often, simple dietary changes can help prevent runner's diarrhea: 

In addition, wear comfortable, loosefitting clothing when you run. Clothing that's too tight around the waist may aggravate diarrhea. You might also consider reducing the intensity or distance of your runs until the diarrhea improves. Then gradually increase your activity as your signs and symptoms allow. If these tips don't seem to help, consult your doctor for additional suggestions.

		Are sagging breasts inevitable after breast-feeding?
	","
It's normal to wonder how breast-feeding will affect your breasts, but take heart. Research has shown that breast-feeding doesn't negatively affect breast shape or volume.

Still, sagging breasts are a valid concern. During pregnancy, the ligaments that support your breasts may stretch as your breasts get fuller and heavier. This stretching may contribute to sagging breasts after pregnancy — whether or not you breast-feed your baby. Sagging breasts may be more noticeable with each subsequent pregnancy, especially if you have large breasts.

Other factors also contribute to sagging breasts, including aging and smoking — both of which reduce skin elasticity. Being overweight can have a similar effect.

Remember, breast-feeding is best for babies. Don't let a fear of sagging breasts stop you from breast-feeding. To maintain the appearance of your breasts at any stage of life, make healthy lifestyle choices. Include physical activity in your daily routine. Eat a healthy diet. If you smoke, ask your doctor to help you quit.

		What research has been done about the risks of Salvia divinorum?
	","
Salvia divinorum, also known as diviner's sage, is a potent mind-altering herb that originated in Mexico. Salvia divinorum isn't thought to be addictive, but the herb hasn't been adequately studied in clinical trials — so researchers know little about the risks or long-terms effects of Salvia divinorum use.

Salvia divinorum is typically inhaled. The intense, sometimes debilitating effects of the herb strike quickly — often including senseless laughter, a sense of not being yourself and the loss of emotional reactions. And the risks are real, including nausea, dizziness, slurred speech, confusion, paranoia and hallucinations. Although Salvia divinorum effects usually subside within 30 minutes, some may linger for days.

Salvia divinorum is widely available online, and the herb is sold legally in many smoke shops throughout the United States and elsewhere — but that doesn't mean that it's safe. If you have children, discuss with them the dangers of drug use. You may want to involve other family members, a counselor or your child's doctor in the discussion as well.

Other types of salvia — including Salvia officinalis (sage) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) — don't have the mind-altering effects of Salvia divinorum. Sage is used as a cooking spice, as well as a treatment for digestive problems and various other medical conditions. Danshen also is used for various medical conditions, including circulation problems and a number of skin conditions.

		How does a doctor tell the difference between scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp?
	","
Scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can be difficult to differentiate. Both are common conditions that affect the scalp. In addition, they share some similar signs and symptoms, such as itchy, red, scaly skin. 

Most often, the scales of psoriasis are thicker and somewhat drier in appearance than are the scales of seborrheic dermatitis. In addition, psoriasis usually affects more than one area of the body. If you have scalp psoriasis, you may also have mild psoriasis on your elbows, knees, hands or feet or may notice subtle nail changes, such as pitting.

No single test confirms a diagnosis of psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. Your doctor usually makes a diagnosis with a visual examination of the affected skin. Scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp share some similar treatments, including medicated shampoos and topical corticosteroid or antifungal solutions. 

Scalp psoriasis is often persistent and more difficult to treat than is seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. For stubborn cases of scalp psoriasis, your doctor may prescribe oral medications, such as methotrexate (Trexall) or cyclosporine, or combine stronger medications with medicated creams and ointments.

Or does the person have to get clean first?,"Chronic substance abuse can be associated with symptoms of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia. But it can be difficult to determine if the drug abuse is causing symptoms of schizophrenia, or if the schizophrenia is prompting the drug abuse. Some research suggests a link between use of a specific drug, such as marijuana, and development of schizophrenia in individuals who have an underlying predisposition to the disease.People with schizophrenia are at greater risk of substance abuse. The reason for this isn't clear. But they may use alcohol or drugs to try to relieve or decrease symptoms of the illness. Unfortunately, substance abuse can actually increase symptoms and complicate treatment.It's critical to accurately diagnose and treat substance abuse and mental illness. If symptoms of mental illness are caused by substance abuse, they usually diminish within weeks after the person stops taking the substance. But it may take up to six months for all of the effects of the substance to go away. Sometimes the effects of drug use never fully disappear. Some people who have taken the hallucinogen LSD experience flashbacks for the rest of their lives. Ecstasy is another drug that may cause long-term mental effects.It's not always possible to delay treatment for mental symptoms to see if they'll go away when the person stops using the substance. The distress caused by the mental symptoms and the risk of harm to self or others may require prompt treatment with medication and counseling.

		Is sea salt better for your health than table salt?
	","
No. Sea salt and table salt have the same basic nutritional value, despite the fact that sea salt is often marketed as a more natural and healthy alternative. The real differences between sea salt and table salt are in their taste, texture and processing, not their chemical makeup. 

Sea salt is produced through evaporation of seawater, usually with little processing, which leaves behind certain trace minerals and elements depending on its water source. The minerals add flavor and color to sea salt, which also comes in a variety of coarseness levels.

Table salt is mined from underground salt deposits. Table salt is more heavily processed to eliminate minerals and usually contains an additive to prevent clumping. Most table salt also has added iodine, an essential nutrient that's lacking in naturally occurring sea salt. 

By weight, sea salt and table salt contain the same amount of sodium chloride. Your body needs only a very tiny amount of salt to stay healthy. Most people get far too much — mostly from processed foods. So regardless of which type of salt you prefer, use a light hand with the saltshaker. And limit total sodium to less than 2,300 milligrams a day — or 1,500 milligrams if you're age 51 or older, or if you are black, or if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

		I'm having trouble conceiving another child. Why does secondary infertility happen?
	","
Secondary infertility — the inability to get pregnant despite having frequent, unprotected sex for at least a year by a couple who previously had a child — shares many of the same causes of primary infertility.

For example, male infertility can be caused by impaired sperm production, function or delivery. Female infertility can be related to fallopian tube damage, ovulation disorders, endometriosis and uterine conditions. Sometimes, however, secondary infertility stems from complications related to prior pregnancies. Changes in your and your partner's risk factors, such as age, weight and use of certain medications, can also contribute to secondary infertility.

If you're experiencing secondary infertility, talk to your health care provider. Depending on the circumstances, both you and your partner might need medical evaluations. A woman's gynecologist or a man's urologist can help determine whether there's an issue that requires a specialist or treatment at a fertility clinic.

Secondary infertility can be surprising and stressful. Don't try to cope alone. Seek support from your partner, family and friends as you talk to your health care provider about the next steps.

"I have not been to the dentist for many years because of a previous bad experience. Now, I need some dental work done, and I'm terrified. What can I do to get through it?","Many people experience some level of trepidation about dental procedures. This is normal — especially if you've had a prior bad experience. Talk to your dentist about your concerns and ask him or her about the possibility of using dental sedation.Sedation dentistry involves the use of medications to allow you to relax and feel sleepy during a dental visit or procedure. This is referred to as conscious sedation. However, sedation is not pain medication, so you will still require local anesthesia, such as Novocain, during treatment.There are a variety of sedation dentistry methods. The most common types are inhaled sedation, which involves breathing in a mixture of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and oxygen; and oral sedatives, which are medications taken by mouth. Another type of dental sedation is intravenous (IV) sedation, which is provided by dentists with specialized training in IV sedation. The major advantage of IV sedation is the ability to adjust the level of sedation when needed.With conscious sedation, you breathe on your own. You're also responsive to vocal commands and sensory stimulation. You may feel so relaxed that you fall asleep during the procedure. Afterwards, you may feel groggy and disoriented and may require help getting home. In addition, you may not remember what happened during the time you were sedated.Conscious sedation is safe when administered by dentists trained in its use. However, as with any medication, sedation involves a certain amount of risk. It is important to talk to your dentist about these risks."
What does it mean if you have an elevated sed rate?, Sedimentation rate — also referred to as sed rate or erythrocyte sedimentation rate — measures the speed at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a glass tube. The presence of certain abnormal proteins in the blood can cause red blood cells to stick together and sink to the bottom more quickly.  An elevated sed rate is not specific to any one disease. Possible causes include:  An elevated sed rate may indicate an underlying problem. But further testing is needed to identify the cause of the problem.

		I'm a 76-year-old woman and haven't been sexually active in many years. Is it too late to resume sexual activity?
	","
You can resume sexual activity at any time, as long as you're willing to invest a little time and patience. 

With age, the vagina and vaginal opening often become smaller and the vaginal lining becomes thinner — especially when estrogen levels are low. As a result, it can take longer for the vagina to swell and lubricate during sexual arousal. Together these changes can make sex painful. 

To make sex more comfortable: 

In addition, keep in mind the need to practice safe sex — especially with a new partner. There's no age limit for sexually transmitted infections. Use a condom every time you have sex, and discuss testing for sexually transmitted infections with your partner. 

Finally, remember that there's more to sex than intercourse. Activities such as talking, touching and kissing can help promote intimacy and lead to sexual satisfaction.

		Does moderate alcohol use interfere with shingles treatment?
	","
Shingles (herpes zoster) is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. An episode of shingles usually heals on its own within a few weeks. However, prompt shingles treatment — often including an antiviral drug such as acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir) or valacyclovir (Valtrex) — can ease pain, speed healing and reduce the risk of complications. 

Generally, it's best to avoid alcohol during the course of shingles treatment. Although alcohol warnings aren't specifically listed in the product labels for the antiviral drugs most often used to treat shingles, it's usually best to avoid mixing alcohol and medication. Alcohol can reduce the effectiveness of certain medications, as well as increase the risk of side effects, such as dizziness, especially in older adults.

		After getting the shingles vaccine, my doctor said to stay away from my pregnant daughter and my grandchildren. Can you tell me why?

The virus that causes shingles — varicella-zoster virus — is also the virus that causes chickenpox. Your doctor's concern about your daughter and grandchildren may stem from reports of rare cases in which people with no immunity to chickenpox — meaning they've never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine — have caught varicella-zoster virus from children recently vaccinated with the chickenpox vaccine. 

However, there are no documented cases of the varicella-zoster virus being transmitted from adults vaccinated with the shingles vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Varicella-zoster vaccines are recommended for children to prevent chickenpox and for adults age 50 and older to prevent shingles, but the formulations are different, and the vaccines are not interchangeable. 

According to the CDC, in normal circumstances it's unnecessary to avoid pregnant women and unvaccinated children after you get the shingles vaccine. However, if you develop a rash after you get the shingles vaccine, always take the precaution of keeping the rash covered until all the bumps crust over. 

To develop shingles, you have to catch chickenpox first, which typically happens in childhood. When you get over chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus stays in your body, but remains dormant, often for many years and possibly for life. As you age, though, there's an increasing risk that the virus will reactivate, resulting in shingles.

Whether they've had shingles or not, adults age 60 and older should get the shingles vaccine (Zostavax), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although the vaccine is also approved for use in people ages 50 to 59 years, the CDC isn't recommending the shingles vaccine until you reach age 60. 

The shingles vaccine protects your body from reactivation of a virus — the chickenpox (varicella-zoster) virus — that most people are exposed to during childhood. When you recover from chickenpox, the virus stays latent in your body. For unknown reasons, though, the latent virus sometimes gets reactivated years later, causing shingles. The shingles vaccine prevents this reactivation. 

The shingles vaccine isn't fail-safe; some people develop shingles despite vaccination. Even when it fails to suppress the virus completely, however, the shingles vaccine may reduce the severity and duration of shingles. Although there's hope that the vaccine will reduce your risk of severe, lingering pain after shingles (postherpetic neuralgia), studies haven't yet found strong evidence of that effect. 

The shingles vaccine is a live vaccine given as a single injection, usually in the upper arm. The most common side effects of the shingles vaccine are redness, pain, tenderness and swelling at the injection site, and headaches. 

The shingles vaccine isn't recommended if you: 

In some cases, the cost of the shingles vaccine may not be covered by Medicare or insurance. Check your plan.

My brother has severe sickle cell anemia. Could moving to a warmer climate help him?,"Possibly. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disease in which normally round red blood cells become crescent shaped. As a result, they can get stuck in small blood vessels, leading to painful episodes called ""sickle cell crises.""A sickle cell pain crisis can be triggered by certain weather conditions, such as high winds and low humidity. Other common triggers include dehydration, stress, illness, infection, alcohol use, sleep apnea and high altitudes.There's no definitive evidence of a direct relationship between cold weather and sickle cell crisis. Still, if cold weather seems to trigger these attacks, then moving to a warmer climate may be a consideration for your brother. However, this may not be a ""cure."" Individuals living in warmer climates are at increased risk of dehydration, which can just as easily cause a crisis.There is no one right or wrong answer for reducing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. But clearly, in someone with severe sickle cell anemia, every effort should be made to try to alleviate signs and symptoms.If your brother stays in a colder climate, he may reduce the risk of a pain crisis by avoiding going outside in very frigid weather, by wearing warm clothes outside in cold weather and by dressing in layers in air-conditioned rooms during hot weather. Also, he should avoid swimming in cold water."

		What is a silent heart attack?
	","
A silent heart attack is a heart attack that has few, if any, symptoms. You may have never had any symptoms to warn you that you've developed a heart problem, such as chest pain or shortness of breath. Some people later recall their silent heart attack was mistaken for indigestion, nausea, muscle pain, or a bad case of the flu. 

The risk factors for having a silent heart attack are the same as having a heart attack with symptoms. The risk factors include: 

Having a silent heart attack puts you at a greater risk of having another heart attack, which could be fatal. Having another heart attack also increases your risk of complications, such as heart failure. 

If you wonder if you've had a silent heart attack, talk to your doctor. A review of your symptoms, health history and a physical exam can help your doctor decide if more tests are necessary. The only way to tell if you've had a silent heart attack is to have additional tests, such as an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram or other imaging tests. These tests can reveal changes that signal you've had a heart attack.

		If silicone breast implants rupture, what are the possible complications?
	","
Ruptured silicone breast implants can cause breast pain or changes in the contour or shape of the breast. Ruptured silicone breast implants aren't thought to cause breast cancer, reproductive problems or connective tissue disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 

When a silicone breast implant is placed in your body, fibrous tissue (capsule) forms around the implant. If the implant ruptures, it might go unnoticed because any free silicone tends to remain trapped in the surrounding tissue. This is known as a silent rupture. 

It's possible, however, for the fibrous tissue to become inflamed. Additional scar tissue might form as well. This can lead to: 

If you have silicone breast implants and suspect that an implant might have ruptured, consult your doctor. He or she might rule out or confirm the rupture with an imaging test, such as an MRI scan. 

If you have a silent rupture — one that's not causing signs or symptoms — treatment might be up to you. Some women take a wait-and-see approach, while others prefer to remove or replace the ruptured implant. Ask your doctor to help you weigh the pros and cons of both options. 

If you have a ruptured silicone implant that's causing signs or symptoms, your doctor will likely recommend surgical removal. If you wish, a new implant can usually be inserted at the same time. 

If you decide that you don't want breast implants any longer, the implants can be removed at any time. You might need a breast lift or other corrective surgery to help your breasts maintain an aesthetically pleasing appearance. 

Keep in mind that breast implants aren't guaranteed to last a lifetime. 

In fact, the Food and Drug Administration recommends routine MRI scans to detect silent ruptures in silicone breast implants — starting three years after the implants are inserted and repeated every two years after that. Debate continues, however, on whether the benefit of routine MRI scans justifies the cost. There's also a concern that routine MRI scans have the potential to lead to unnecessary surgery. 

Work with your doctor to determine what's best for you.

		Can a sinus infection cause a toothache?
	","
Yes, a sinus infection (sinusitis) or inflammation can cause a toothache — especially in the upper rear teeth, which are close to the sinuses. In fact, pain in the upper teeth is a fairly common symptom with sinus conditions.

If you have a persistent toothache, consult your dentist for an exam. He or she will consider possible dental causes for the toothache, such as periodontal disease, tooth grinding, cavities or dental abscesses.

If your dentist rules out a dental cause for the toothache, consult your doctor. He or she will consider whether a sinus condition or other underlying medical problem is contributing to the toothache.

		What are the risks of sitting too much?
	","
Researchers have linked sitting for long periods of time with a number of health concerns, including obesity and metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions that includes increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol levels. 

Too much sitting also seems to increase the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. 

One recent study compared adults who spent less than two hours a day in front of the TV or other screen-based entertainment with those who logged more than four hours a day of recreational screen time. Those with greater screen time had: 

The increased risk was separate from other traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking or high blood pressure.

Sitting in front of the TV isn't the only concern. Any extended sitting — such as behind a desk at work or behind the wheel — can be harmful. What's more, spending a few hours a week at the gym or otherwise engaged in moderate or vigorous activity doesn't seem to significantly offset the risk. 

Rather, the solution seems to be less sitting and more moving overall. You might start by simply standing rather than sitting whenever you have the chance. 

For example: 

Better yet, think about ways to walk while you work: 

The impact of movement — even leisurely movement — can be profound. For starters, you'll burn more calories. This might lead to weight loss and increased energy. 

Even better, the muscle activity needed for standing and other movement seems to trigger important processes related to the breakdown of fats and sugars within the body. When you sit, these processes stall — and your health risks increase. When you're standing or actively moving, you kick the processes back into action.

		During sit-ups I stabilize my feet by placing them under the edge of the sofa. Am I using the proper technique?
	","
Stabilizing your feet during sit-ups can be an effective technique, as long as you're using proper form to do the rest of the exercise. The goal of any isolated abdominal muscle exercise is to work the abdominal muscles without working other muscles around the hips. The more you isolate your abdominal muscles, the more effective your sit-ups will be — and the better your results. 

To safely stabilize your feet during sit-ups, place them loosely under the edge of a couch or other heavy piece of furniture. To more effectively isolate your abdominal muscles, though, bend your knees and hips at a 90-degree angle and place your feet against a wall. Avoid having someone rigidly hold down your feet, which some research suggests may work the hip muscles more than the abdominal muscles. 

When you're ready to begin the exercise: 

Keep your movements smooth and controlled, letting your abdominal muscles do the work.

		Since being diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome last year, I've had three urinary tract infections. Is there any evidence that Sjogren's syndrome causes recurrent UTIs?
	","
No, but Sjogren's syndrome can cause symptoms that you might mistake for a urinary tract infection (UTI). Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which the moisture-secreting glands of the eyes and mouth become inflamed, producing fewer tears and less saliva. 

For women, Sjogren's syndrome can also cause vaginal dryness — which may result in discomfort during sexual intercourse and an increase in the risk of bacterial and fungal vaginal infections. Painful urination, a common symptom of UTIs, also can occur with vaginal infections. 

Some women who have Sjogren's syndrome develop a condition called painful bladder syndrome, also known as interstitial cystitis. This condition causes symptoms similar to those of a urinary tract infection — urinary frequency, urgency and pain — without evidence of infection.

How are skin tags removed? Can I do it myself?,"Skin tags are small, soft, flesh-colored growths that protrude from your skin. They are generally harmless. However, if needed, skin tags can be snipped off with a scissors, or removed by freezing (cryotherapy) or with electrical current (electrodessication) in your dermatologist's office.It is generally not recommended that you remove skin tags yourself because of the increased risk of infection and excessive bleeding. In addition, other skin growths — such as moles, keratoses, hemangiomas and pyogenic granulomas — can resemble skin tags and should only be removed by a doctor."

		Is it OK to use over-the-counter antihistamines to treat insomnia? I'd like to avoid prescription sleep aids.
	","
Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, which might help you fall asleep for a few nights — but routine use of antihistamines for insomnia isn't recommended. 

Antihistamines induce drowsiness by working against histamine, a chemical produced by the central nervous system. In fact, most over-the-counter sleep aids contain antihistamines. These products are intended to be used for only two to three nights at a time, however, such as when stress, travel or other disruptions keep you awake. Tolerance to the sedative effects of antihistamines can develop quickly — so the longer you take them, the less likely they are to make you sleepy. Side effects might include daytime drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness and memory problems. 

Also, keep in mind that diphenhydramine and doxylamine — sedating antihistamines found in various over-the-counter sleep aids — aren't recommended for people who have closed-angle glaucoma, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe liver disease or urinary retention, which can be preceded by a weak urine stream or trouble starting urination. In addition, most sleep aids aren't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. 

If you're struggling with chronic insomnia, don't rely on antihistamines or other over-the-counter sleep aids for a good night's sleep. Start with lifestyle changes instead: 

If you continue to have trouble falling or staying asleep, consult your doctor. In addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor might recommend ways to make your sleeping environment more conducive to sleep or behavior therapy to help you learn new sleep habits. In some cases, short-term use of prescription sleep aids might be recommended as well.

"My 19-month-old daughter constantly cries out in her sleep. Right before she does this, she appears to stop breathing. She also snores. Could she have sleep apnea?","Yes, she could have sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a doctor. Sleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea in children. In OSA, the muscles in the walls of the throat (pharynx) relax while the child sleeps, so the walls collapse and obstruct the flow of air. After 10 to 30 seconds, the child rouses to a lighter level of sleep or brief wakefulness. The muscles tighten — relieving the obstruction — and the child breathes again.In children, obstructive sleep apnea usually occurs between the ages of 3 years and 6 years. The most common cause at that age is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. A rare cause of obstructive sleep apnea in children is a tumor or growth in the airway. Certain conditions such as Down syndrome also can cause OSA.Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in children include:If you suspect that your child has obstructive sleep apnea, consult your child's doctor promptly. He or she may refer you to a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric sleep disorders.A doctor may diagnose obstructive sleep apnea by:The most common treatment for children with obstructive sleep apnea is surgical removal of both the tonsils and the adenoids (adenotonsillectomy). After removal of the tonsils and adenoids, the child's upper airway is no longer blocked. Studies indicate that adenotonsillectomy has a high cure rate in children with obstructive sleep apnea.If sleep apnea doesn't improve with removal of the tonsils and adenoids, treatment may include use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which delivers air through the nose at a pressure that keeps the upper airway passages open during sleep."
"
		Is it true that sleep deprivation can cause high blood pressure?
	","
Possibly. It's thought that sleeping less than six hours a night could be linked to increased blood pressure. 

People who sleep five hours or less a night may be at higher risk of developing high blood pressure or worsening already high blood pressure. There's also an increased risk of high blood pressure for people who sleep between five and six hours a night. 

It's thought that sleep helps your blood regulate stress hormones and helps your nervous system remain healthy. Over time, a lack of sleep could hurt your body's ability to regulate stress hormones, leading to high blood pressure. 

Sleeping seven to eight hours a night may play a role in the treatment and prevention of high blood pressure. Talk to your doctor for tips on getting better sleep, especially if you have high blood pressure. 

Also talk with your doctor if you feel tired even after a full night's sleep. One possible — and treatable — cause, sleep apnea, increases your risk of heart problems and other health issues.

		Is it possible to be overweight because of a slow metabolism?
	","
Probably not. There is such a thing as a slow metabolism. But slow metabolism is rare, and it's usually not what's behind being overweight or obese — that's usually a matter of diet and exercise. 

Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Even when you're at rest, your body needs energy for functions such as breathing, circulating blood and repairing cells. The number of calories your body uses for these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate (BMR). 

Several factors determine your basal metabolic rate:

Rather than slow metabolism, factors more likely to contribute to weight gain include:

If you're concerned about slow metabolism and your weight, talk to your doctor about healthy changes you can make. And if you still think you have slow metabolism, your doctor can check your metabolism or check for rare conditions that can cause problems with metabolism, such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome.

		Is it true that smoking causes wrinkles?
	","
Yes. So if you need another reason to motivate you to quit smoking, add premature wrinkles to the list. 

Smoking can speed up the normal aging process of your skin, contributing to wrinkles. These skin changes may occur after only 10 years of smoking. The more cigarettes you smoke and the longer you smoke, the more skin wrinkling you're likely to have — even though the early skin damage from smoking may be hard for you to see. 

And smoking doesn't cause wrinkles only on your face. Smoking also is associated with increased wrinkling and skin damage on other parts of your body, including your inner arms. While the skin wrinkles may not be reversible, you can prevent worsening of wrinkling by quitting smoking now. 

How does smoking lead to wrinkles? The nicotine in cigarettes causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the outermost layers of your skin. This impairs blood flow to your skin. With less blood flow, your skin doesn't get as much oxygen and important nutrients, such as vitamin A. Many of the more than 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke also damage collagen and elastin, which are fibers that give your skin its strength and elasticity. As a result, skin begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely because of smoking. 

In addition, repeated exposure to the heat from burning cigarettes and the facial expressions you make when smoking — such as pursing your lips when inhaling and squinting your eyes to keep out smoke — may contribute to wrinkles.

		Does the sodium nitrate in processed meat increase my risk of heart disease?
	","
Sodium nitrate, a preservative that's used in some processed meats, such as bacon, jerky and luncheon meats, could increase your heart disease risk. Aside from the salt and saturated fat in these meats that can disrupt a heart-healthy diet, sodium nitrate also may harm your heart. It's thought that sodium nitrate may damage your blood vessels, making your arteries more likely to harden and narrow, leading to heart disease. Nitrates may also affect the way your body uses sugar, making you more likely to develop diabetes. 

If you eat meat, it's best to limit processed meat in your diet and focus on lean, fresh meats and poultry. Lean beef, pork and poultry are good choices, but limit your servings to no more than 6 ounces (170 grams, or about the size of two decks of playing cards) daily, depending on your overall dietary plan.

Possibly. Although eating soy-based foods can slightly reduce your low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol level, the American Heart Association has concluded that soy doesn't significantly lower cholesterol. However, eating soy-based foods can still be good for you because soy-based foods contain less saturated fat than meat does and also provide other beneficial nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and fiber.

Whether people who have hypothyroidism should avoid soy is a topic of considerable debate. 

Hypothyroidism is generally treated with synthetic thyroid hormone — and soy has long been thought to interfere with the body's ability to absorb the medication. However, there's no evidence that people who have hypothyroidism should avoid soy completely.

If you have hypothyroidism, take thyroid hormone replacement as directed by your doctor — typically on an empty stomach. Generally, it's best to wait four hours after taking thyroid medication to consume any products that contain soy. The same guidelines apply to other products that may impair the body's ability to absorb thyroid medication, including high-fiber foods, iron and calcium supplements, and antacids that contain aluminum or magnesium.

But I'm wondering if he's overdoing it with wraps. When is wrapping appropriate?,"Compression wraps are often helpful for sprained ankles, wrists and elbows. This is part of the initial treatment approach for sprains and strains — along with immobilizing, resting, icing and elevating the injury. Wrapping the injury with an elastic bandage helps reduce swelling.Taping may also be used to provide added support to an injured joint, such as a sprained ankle or wrist. Although taping initially may be helpful in providing support, athletic tape loses its stabilizing effect within a relatively short period. Support braces, such as ankle support braces, may provide longer term benefit in preventing sprains.When applying a compression wrap, be sure not to wrap the joint or muscle too tightly. This may impair circulation. Begin wrapping at the farthest part from your heart. Loosen the wrap if the pain increases, the area becomes numb or swelling is occurring below the wrapped area.Although compression wrapping is an effective initial treatment for sprained ankles, wrists and elbows, it should be followed up by a medical evaluation to determine the extent and type of injury and, if needed, to design appropriate rehabilitation therapy to maximize strength and function.One of the best ""braces"" you can give yourself is your muscle ""brace.""

Starting solids too late — after age 6 months — poses another set of issues. Waiting too long can: 

Postponing solids — including highly allergenic foods — past 4 to 6 months hasn't been shown to prevent asthma, hay fever, eczema or food allergies. 

In addition to your baby's age, look for other signs that he or she is ready to start eating solid foods. Can your baby hold his or her head in a steady, upright position? Can your baby sit with support? If you answer yes to these questions and you have the OK from your baby's doctor, you can begin supplementing your baby's liquid diet. Remember, however, breast milk or formula remains your baby's primary source of nutrition until age 1. 

If you're concerned about food allergies or any close relatives have a food allergy, check with your baby's doctor or a dietitian before starting solids. You might consider introducing single-ingredient solids at a rate of no more than one new food a week. In addition, you might consider giving your child his or her first tastes of a highly allergenic food, such as eggs, fish or peanut butter, at home — rather than at a restaurant — with an oral antihistamine available, just in case. If your child doesn't have a reaction, you can continue introducing the food in gradually increasing amounts.

	","
There's no good evidence that statins cause or trigger ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. However, there have been reports of people who have developed ALS while taking statins.

ALS is a serious neurological disorder that causes disease and death of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscles. ALS may begin with muscle twitching, weakness in an arm or leg, or changes in speech (dysarthria). Eventually, it affects the ability to control the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe.

Statins are medications prescribed for the treatment of high cholesterol. These medications can sometimes cause muscle pain (myalgia), muscle weakness and rarely severe muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis). But these occur as a result of direct muscle damage, not damage to nerve cells.

In the U.S., a purified component form of the plant — called rebaudioside A (rebiana) — is ""generally recognized as safe"" by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may be used as an artificial sweetener in foods and beverages. 

Refined stevia preparations (Pure Via, Truvia, others) are considered nonnutritive sweeteners and, as such, may appeal to people trying to lose weight. But there's no evidence that they offer an advantage for weight loss over other artificial sweeteners. In addition, these highly refined stevia extracts may cause mild side effects, such as nausea or a feeling of fullness. 

The FDA hasn't approved whole-leaf stevia or crude stevia extracts for use as food additives because of concerns about possible health effects. In particular, the FDA has concerns about the effects of whole-leaf or crude stevia on blood sugar control, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular and reproductive systems. 

Remember that while sugar substitutes, such as refined stevia preparations, may help with weight management, they aren't a magic bullet and should be used only in moderation. If you eat too many sugar-free foods, you can still gain weight if they have other ingredients that contain calories.

What can you tell me about Stickler's syndrome?,"Stickler's syndrome is an inherited, progressive connective tissue disorder that typically affects the eyes, ears, bones, joints and face. Doctors may also refer to it as Stickler dysplasia or hereditary progressive arthro-ophthalmopathy.This disorder is due to a defective gene involved in the formation of collagen, a fibrous protein found in connective tissues. The defect is autosomal dominant, which means that the child of a parent with the abnormal gene has a 50 percent chance of inheriting it. But in a few cases, the gene defect is the result of a spontaneous mutation — meaning it occurs with no prior family history of the disease.Stickler's syndrome has a range of signs and symptoms, including:A doctor may make a diagnosis based on signs and symptoms and a physical exam. Stickler's syndrome is most often diagnosed in childhood. Treatment is directed at managing the signs and symptoms and may include:"
What is stiff-person syndrome? Can it be treated?,"There is no cure for stiff-person syndrome, formerly called stiff-man syndrome. But treatment may improve symptoms.Stiff-person syndrome is a rare, disabling neurological disorder characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly in the spine and legs. It also causes painful muscle spasms triggered by sensory stimuli, such as sudden loud noises or emotional distress. Stiff-person syndrome was first described in 1956 by doctors at Mayo Clinic.The exact cause of stiff-person syndrome isn't clear. But it may be due to an autoimmune disorder.In stiff-person syndrome, the immune system makes antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD plays an important role in the production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits certain activity in the spinal cord and brain. Rarely, stiff-person syndrome is associated with antibodies produced by certain cancers, such as breast cancer.Treatment of stiff-person syndrome may include:"

		How long am I contagious if I have the stomach flu?
	","
You can be contagious from a few days to two weeks, depending on which virus is causing your stomach flu (gastroenteritis). A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including noroviruses and rotaviruses. The contagious period — the time during which a sick person can give the illness to others — is slightly different for each virus. 

The viruses that cause gastroenteritis are spread through close contact with infected people, such as by sharing food or eating utensils. Washing your hands or using hand sanitizer is the most effective way to stop the spread of these viruses to others.

		What makes my stomach growl when I'm hungry?
	","
Stomach noise — such as rumbling, gurgling and growling — typically is due to normal digestion. Stomach growling can occur when you're hungry. But it can also occur after eating or between meals when food is being digested. 

Hunger and appetite are controlled by a complex system of nerve signals and hormone-like substances primarily made by your digestive system. When you haven't eaten for a while, these substances are released and cause a part of your brain called the hypothalamus to ""switch on"" your desire to eat. A message is then sent to your stomach and intestines. This triggers muscle contractions and the release of acids and other digestive fluids — which causes the rumbling, grumbling sounds you hear — as your body prepares for you to eat. The thought, sight or smell of food also can trigger this response. 

Sometimes excessive stomach noise can be a symptom of an underlying gastrointestinal disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome. But in such cases, stomach noise usually is accompanied by other signs and symptoms such as bloating, cramping, diarrhea or excess gas.

		Yesterday, my stool color was bright green. Should I be concerned?
	","
Stool comes in a range of colors. All shades of brown and even green are considered normal. Only rarely does stool color indicate a potentially serious intestinal condition. 

Stool color is generally influenced by what you eat as well as by the amount of bile — a yellow-green fluid that digests fats — in your stool. As bile pigments travel through your gastrointestinal tract, they are chemically altered by enzymes — changing the pigments from green to brown. 

Consult your doctor if you're concerned about your stool color. If your stool is bright red or black — which may indicate the presence of blood — seek prompt medical attention.

		What's better for strength training — one set or multiple sets?
	","
For most people, a single set of 12 repetitions with the proper weight can build strength and improve fitness as effectively as can multiple sets of the same exercise. 

The one-set approach also has the advantage of saving time, which makes it easier to fit into an exercise routine. Simply choose a weight that tires your muscles around the 12th repetition. As this becomes easier, gradually increase the amount of weight to maintain a 12-repetition fatigue. 

There's a caveat, though: If you're a bodybuilder or an elite athlete with specific performance enhancement goals, additional strength training sets may be beneficial.

"For several years, I've followed the same strength training program on weight machines, with good results. Now, I'm being advised to ""mix it up"" with free weights and exercise balls. Are there any advantages to this?","It sounds like your current program is working well for you and no changes may be needed. However, variety can be the ""spice"" of strength training. Muscles gradually adapt to the same stimuli over time. Your strength training gains may plateau if you stick with the same routine.Experimenting with different forms of strength training challenges your muscles to adapt and improve in different ways. Free weights may help improve whole-body stabilization. They also promote symmetrical muscle development. Exercise balls can help you effectively work the ""core"" abdominal muscles. Even different exercises that work the same muscle groups can provide a different stimulus for the muscles to improve.The bottom line is that you have to enjoy the exercises you do in order to do them. So if you're doing well with your current program and you're meeting your strength training goals, you may not need to ""fix"" anything."
What is strep C in humans?,"Strep C is a type of streptococcus bacteria commonly found in animals, such as birds, rabbits, horses and guinea pigs.

Strep throat is an infection caused by a bacterium known as group A streptococcus. Strep throat can occur at any age, even during infancy. However, strep throat is most common in school-age children and young adults. 

For the few infants who develop strep throat, signs and symptoms may include: 

Strep throat is diagnosed with a throat culture, in which the doctor swabs the child's throat and tests the sample for the presence of strep bacteria. Treatment for strep throat is typically a course of antibiotics. 

Recurrent strep throat isn't likely a sign of an underlying problem with a child's immune system. Children who develop strep throat repeatedly may have contact with a carrier of strep, likely at home or in a child care setting — or may be strep carriers themselves. Recurrent strep throat is often treated with a different antibiotic from the one prescribed originally.

I thought sun exposure increased the risk of cancer. But I just read that sunlight may help fight cancer.

According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), some researchers are now investigating whether vitamin D may have a role in preventing or treating cancer.The theory that vitamin D may reduce cancer risk is based in part on studies showing that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased prevalence of cancer and on evidence that vitamin D has some anti-cancer properties. But more research is needed to evaluate the role of sunlight-induced production of vitamin D in preventing cancer, according to the NCI.The current information about vitamin D can be confusing. The skin makes vitamin D after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Yet, many experts say that there is no safe amount of sun exposure because ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer. These potentially negative effects are likely cumulative over a person's lifetime.The amount of vitamin D that may help prevent cancer, if any, isn't known. Also, the exact amount of sunlight needed to replenish the body's stores of vitamin D isn't known.Until more is known, it's important to protect your skin from too much sun, according to the American Cancer Society.

Unfortunately, there's no fast-fix sunburn treatment. Once you have sunburn, the damage is done — although it may take 12 to 24 hours after sun exposure to know the full extent and severity of sunburn, and several days or more for your skin to begin to heal. 

In the meantime, the most effective sunburn treatment simply helps ease your discomfort: 

Consult a doctor for sunburn treatment if: 

To prevent future episodes of sunburn, use sunscreen frequently and liberally. Select a broad-spectrum product — one that provides protection against both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation — with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. If you take medications that make sunburn more likely, be especially careful. A common example is tetracycline taken orally for acne. Common sense counts, too. Cover up while you're outdoors, and stay in the shade as much as possible.

<strong>Tips for reducing this type of disorientation</strong> in your loved one

Research suggests that a low dose of melatonin — a naturally occurring hormone that induces sleepiness — in combination with exposure to bright light during the day may help minimize the disorientation associated with sundowning.

When sundowning occurs in a care facility, it may be related to the flurry of activity during staff shift changes. Staff arriving and leaving may cue some people with Alzheimer's to want to go home or to check on their children — or other behaviors that were appropriate in the late afternoon in their past. It may help to occupy their time during that period.

"I'm concerned about skin cancer, so I avoid the sun as much as possible. But I also know that my body needs some sun to make vitamin D. So how much sun do I need?","This is an insightful question. The short answer is that most people don't need significant amounts of sun exposure to enhance production of vitamin D, which is essential for healthy teeth and bones. Ten to 15 minutes of sun exposure twice a week to the face, arms, hands or back without sunscreen is usually enough. This should be followed by application of sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15.Although sunlight is a major source of vitamin D, it isn't the only source. Many foods are supplemented with vitamin D, such as fortified milk and cereals. Other food sources of vitamin D include salmon, herring, eggs and mushrooms. It's important for people with limited sun exposure to include good sources of vitamin D in their diets.Sunscreens with an SPF of 8 or greater will block ultraviolet rays that produce vitamin D. But it's still important to routinely use sunscreen to help prevent skin cancer and other harmful consequences of excessive sun exposure."
I read that several ingredients in sunscreen are similar to estrogen and may cause breast cancer. Is this true?,"No studies have proved that ingredients in sunscreen are linked to breast cancer.

		Is superslow strength training more effective than regular strength training?
	","
Research hasn't shown superslow strength training to be superior to other forms of strength training. Still, superslow strength training is a reasonable tool if you want to vary your strength training routine. 

Superslow strength training is a strength training technique in which you lift and lower a weight more slowly than usual — about 10 seconds to lift the weight and another 10 seconds to lower the weight. The goal of superslow strength training is to limit momentum. This forces your muscles to work harder to lift the weight. 

Superslow strength training may help prevent boredom in your strength training routine while you challenge your muscles in a new and different way. If you try superslow strength training, start with a familiar strength training exercise and a weight that tires your muscles by 12 to 15 repetitions — which might be less weight than you usually use. As with any type of strength training, remember the importance of good form and proper technique.

Tanning beds don't offer a safe alternative to natural sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation damages your skin, whether the exposure comes from tanning beds or natural sunlight.

		Should I go to a tanning salon before a sunny vacation to help prevent sunburn?
	","
Many people go to tanning salons to get a so-called ""base tan"" before leaving on a beach vacation. The theory behind this is a few sessions of indoor tanning will protect your skin from sunburn. But there's little evidence that this is true.

Tanning under the sun or a sunlamp gives protection that is equivalent to a sun protection factor (SPF) of 4 or less, which translates into a little extra time in the sun before you start to burn. But the larger issue is that any change in skin color is a sign of damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Repeated exposure to UV radiation — whether from the sun or a tanning bed — increases your risk of premature skin aging and skin cancer.

To prevent sunburn and other skin conditions, use these sun protection methods:

Some people have medical conditions, such as polymorphous light eruption, that may require small, incremental exposures to UV light before a vacation to prevent flare-ups. Talk to your doctor before beginning a regimented sunbathing program if you need to treat or prevent a skin condition.

		Do Tarlov cysts usually cause back pain?
	","
It's possible. However, Tarlov cysts are an uncommon cause of back pain. 

Tarlov cysts are fluid-filled sacs that most often affect nerve roots at the lower end of the spine (sacrum). Such cysts typically cause no symptoms and are found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies done for other reasons.

However, in some cases, the cysts expand, putting pressure on the affected nerve root. The results may include sharp, burning pain in the hip and down the back of the thigh, possibly with weakness and reduced sensation all along the affected leg and foot. Tarlov cysts sometimes enlarge enough to cause erosion of the surrounding bone, which is another way they may cause back pain. 

In most cases, Tarlov cysts require no treatment. Experimentally, painful Tarlov cysts have been treated successfully with oral or injected corticosteroids. Some surgical treatments — such as draining the cyst — have had promising results. Because symptomatic Tarlov cysts are uncommon, though, studies so far have been too small and too dissimilar to identify the most effective procedure. Tarlov cysts also tend to recur after surgery.

Generally, it's safe to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if you have tattoos. However, extra caution may be required.

MRI is a diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed cross-sectional images of your body. Reports of burns in tattooed areas — particularly in dark black tattoos — during MRIs have been widely circulated. It's unknown how often the problem occurs, however.

Some researchers suspect that the burns are related to the iron oxide in dark tattoo ink. Iron oxide is potentially magnetic. It also conducts electricity. If the iron oxide is heated during an MRI, the affected area may be burned.

Taurine is found naturally in meat, fish and breast milk, and it's commonly available as a dietary supplement. Some studies suggest that taurine supplementation may improve athletic performance, which may explain why taurine is used in many energy drinks. Other studies suggest that taurine combined with caffeine improves mental performance, although this finding remains controversial. And in one study, people with congestive heart failure who took taurine supplements three times a day for two weeks showed improvement in their exercise capacity. 

Up to 3,000 milligrams a day of supplemental taurine is considered safe. Any excess taurine is simply excreted by the kidneys. Moderation is important, however. Little is known about the effects of heavy or long-term taurine use. 

It's also important to remember that there may be high amounts of other ingredients in energy drinks, such as high amounts of caffeine or sugar. Too much caffeine can increase your heart rate and blood pressure, interrupt your sleep, and cause nervousness and irritability. And added sugar may provide unwanted added calories.

For most people, occasional energy drinks are fine, but try to limit yourself to about 16 ounces (500 milliliters) a day.

I know that brewed tea contains antioxidants. What about instant tea?,"Instant tea has fewer antioxidants than brewed tea. This is because processing of tea reduces its antioxidant content, and instant tea is more highly processed than brewed tea. Decaffeinated tea also has fewer antioxidants than caffeinated teas.Brewed tea is a rich source of antioxidants, including flavonoids and catechins. Antioxidants are natural compounds found in many foods. These compounds may protect against tissue damage from free radicals, which may lead to diseases such as cancer and heart disease.*Measured in micrograms per milliliter"
Is it true that lavender and tea tree oils found in many lotions and bath products may cause breast enlargement in boys?,"Maybe. In February 2007, the New England Journal of Medicine reported on three boys younger than 12 years who developed enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) after application of products containing lavender oil or tea tree oil or both. No other causes of gynecomastia could be identified, and the breast enlargement decreased when use of the oils was stopped. Although three case reports don't prove a direct cause and effect, they do raise questions about the safety of such products. Avoiding the use of tea tree oil and lavender oil — at least in young boys — seems like a prudent approach until more definitive studies are available."
Is it true that Teflon can cause cancer and I should stop using my Teflon-coated cookware right now?,"Teflon is a product used primarily to coat cookware so that food doesn't stick to it as easily. One of the chemicals used to make Teflon — called perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA — has been linked to cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals. There is currently debate about what harm PFOA may pose to humans. In early 2006, a group of scientific advisors to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended that PFOA be classified as a ""likely carcinogen"" (cancer-causing substance) in humans. However, the EPA has not yet responded to the advisory committee's recommendations.According to the EPA, trace levels of PFOA have been detected in humans. But it has not yet been determined how humans are exposed to PFOA. Because PFOA stays in the body for a long time, the EPA continues to research the possible adverse health effects of PFOA. At present, the EPA is not advising people to stop using products made with PFOA, such as Teflon-coated cookware.However, given the evidence of adverse health effects in animals and the uncertain effects in humans, the EPA has asked companies that use PFOA to reduce and eventually eliminate PFOA from products and manufacturing plant emissions."

		My 3-year-old son has frequent temper tantrums. How can I tell if the tantrums are normal for a child his age — or if they're a sign of something more serious?
	","
Tempter tantrums are a normal part of growing up. Often, temper tantrums — which may include crying, screaming, or stomping up and down — are simply the expression of a child's frustration. As self-control improves, temper tantrums typically become less common. Most children outgrow tantrums by age 4. 

Sometimes, however, temper tantrums can indicate an underlying issue, such as: 

Rarely, temper tantrums may indicate a more serious condition, such as Asperger's syndrome.

		Which is better for relieving tendinitis pain — ice or heat?
	","
If tendinitis is of recent onset, ice may be a better choice for reducing pain and inflammation. Ice acts as a numbing agent, and it also causes a narrowing of blood vessels, which helps reduce swelling. Heat promotes opening of the blood vessels, which can increase blood flow to an area of chronic injury to promote healing.

Tendons are bands of fibrous tissue that connect muscles to bones. Tendinitis is most often caused by repetitive motions that irritate the tendon over time. Improper technique with activities (such as tennis) or exercise (such as strength training) also can predispose a tendon to injury. Tendons also become less flexible with age, which can make them more prone to injury.

		Would a TENS unit help improve fibromyalgia pain?
	","
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a therapy sometimes used to treat localized or regional pain. During TENS therapy, electrodes deliver electrical impulses to nearby nerve pathways — which can help control or relieve some types of pain.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain in the muscles, ligaments and tendons, as well as fatigue and multiple tender points — places on the body where slight pressure causes pain. Since the pain of fibromyalgia isn't limited to a specific area, TENS therapy isn't likely to be an effective fibromyalgia treatment.

Fibromyalgia is often treated with various medications to relieve pain and improve sleep. Options may include pain relievers, antidepressants and muscle relaxants. Exercise and stress reduction, as well as healthy sleep and eating habits, are important as well. Cognitive-behavioral therapy — working with a mental-health professional to learn effective ways of thinking about and dealing with your condition — also may be recommended.

If you have fibromyalgia and your treatment plan isn't relieving your pain, consult your doctor. He or she may adjust your medications or offer additional treatment options.

However, beta-mimetics are effective in temporarily reducing or stopping contractions in women who are having preterm labor.Beta-mimetics are best used to delay delivery long enough — usually 24 to 48 hours — to allow treatment with corticosteroids to speed fetal lung development. Beyond that use, it isn't clear that the benefits of beta-mimetics outweigh the potential risks for the mother. Adverse effects from beta-mimetic drugs may include fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)."

		I've heard a lot about the terrible twos. Why are 2-year-olds so difficult?
	","
The terrible twos are a normal stage in a toddler's development characterized by mood changes, temper tantrums and a familiarity with the word ""no."" The terrible twos typically occur when toddlers begin to struggle between their reliance on adults and their desire for independence, which may begin even before a child's first birthday. One minute a child may be clinging to his or her parents, and the next he or she is running in the opposite direction and disobeying them. 

While the terrible twos can be difficult for parents and caregivers to navigate, keep in mind that 2-year-olds don't have it easy. No longer infants but not quite ready for preschool either, 2-year-olds undergo major motor, intellectual, social and emotional changes. Their vocabulary is constantly growing, they're eager to do things on their own, and they begin to discover that they're expected to follow certain rules. However, most 2-year-olds still aren't able to move as swiftly as they'd like, clearly communicate their needs or control their feelings. This can lead to frustration and result in misbehavior — in other words, the terrible twos.

"My husband has had pain in his right testicle for the last few days. It hasn't gotten any worse, but it's not going away either. What are some possible causes of testicle pain? Should he see his doctor?"," The testicles are very sensitive, and even a minor injury can cause pain or discomfort. Pain may originate in the testicles themselves, in the scrotum or in the tube at the back of the testicle that stores sperm (the epididymis). Pain in the groin or lower abdomen may also radiate to the testicles. Pinpointing the location of the pain can help determine its cause.  Causes of testicle pain may include:  A more serious cause of testicle pain is testicular torsion, a condition that occurs when the testicles and spermatic cord, a structure that runs from the abdomen to the testicles, twist inside the scrotum. Because testicular torsion can block the flow of blood to the testicles, it requires immediate medical attention. Testicular cancer also may, rarely, cause testicle pain.  Sudden, severe testicle pain requires prompt medical attention — especially if the pain is accompanied by nausea, fever, chills or blood in the urine. Your husband should also see his doctor if he experiences: "
My boyfriend has only one testicle. Will he still be able to have children?,"Having a testicle removed doesn't necessarily make a man sterile. If the remaining testicle is healthy, it can still produce millions of sperm and sufficient amounts of testosterone to maintain fertility.However, if the disease that caused removal of one testicle also affects the other testicle, infertility can occur. Diseases that can affect both testicles include leukemia and other cancers and generalized infections in the body.About two-thirds of men with only one testicle are able to father children. A sperm count (semen analysis) can easily provide information about fertility potential."
What causes testicular atrophy? Can it be treated?,"Testicular atrophy, or shrinking of the testicles, can be due to a variety of causes, including:The testicles consist primarily of germ cells, which make sperm, and Leydig cells, which make male sex hormone (testosterone). Testicular atrophy can affect either or both of these tissues. If only germ cells are affected, infertility may result. If Leydig cells are affected, testosterone levels will diminish, causing decreased sex drive, loss of muscle and bone mass, hot flashes, weight gain, and mood swings.A doctor may make a diagnosis of testicular atrophy by:Treatment of testicular atrophy is directed at the underlying cause when possible. Occasionally, atrophy can be reversed if diagnosed and treated early, but it is usually a permanent condition."

		Is testicular microlithiasis associated with testicular cancer?
	","
Testicular microlithiasis (tes-TIK-u-lur mi-kro-lih-THI-uh-sis) refers to small clusters of calcium seen on an ultrasound examination of the testicles. A growing number of studies have shown a relationship between testicular microlithiasis and testicular cancer. However, it remains uncertain whether having testicular microlithiasis is an independent risk factor for testicular cancer. 

Testicular microlithiasis is uncommon and has many possible causes, such as infection and injury. Most studies of testicular microlithiasis have evaluated men who have had testicular ultrasounds done for some other reason, such as swelling, pain or infertility. In these studies, there appears to be a small association between microlithiasis and testicular cancer. But there's not enough evidence to be certain that the microlithiasis caused cancer. 

Few studies of healthy men with no symptoms have been conducted. But results indicate that testicular microlithiasis is much more common than is testicular cancer. This has led researchers to believe that microlithiasis is unlikely to increase an otherwise healthy man's risk of testicular cancer. 

If testicular microlithiasis is noted on an ultrasound done for some other reason, your doctor may recommend that you do regular testicular self-exams and make an appointment if you find any unusual lumps. If you have other risk factors for testicular cancer, your doctor may recommend close follow-up with annual testicular ultrasound scans.

		Does testosterone therapy help increase sex drive in women? What are the pros and cons?
	","
Research shows that the hormone testosterone does effectively boost sex drive — as well as remedy other sexual problems — in certain women with sexual dysfunction. But the long-term safety of testosterone therapy for women is unknown. For this reason, some doctors are hesitant to recommend testosterone therapy.

Testosterone therapy usually is prescribed only for women who have sufficient estrogen levels and not for women who are postmenopausal and can't or choose not to take estrogen. Testosterone therapy might be appropriate if:

Testosterone therapy isn't appropriate for postmenopausal women who have a history of breast or uterine cancer or those who have cardiovascular or liver disease.

Testosterone therapy for women usually comes in the form of a cream, gel or patch, but sometimes it's prescribed as a pill. However, no commonly prescribed testosterone preparations have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in women. If testosterone is prescribed, it's for off-label use.

Although testosterone contributes to healthy sexual function in women, other factors play a larger role in postmenopausal sexual dysfunction. These factors include decreased estrogen levels, vaginal dryness, medication side effects, chronic health conditions, loss of a spouse or partner, lack of emotional intimacy, conflict, stress, or mood concerns.

		What happens if you get tetanus shots too close together — within a few years instead of the recommended 10 years?
	","
It's usually OK to receive an extra booster of the tetanus vaccine. This is especially true if you're being treated for an acute injury, such as a deep cut or puncture wound, and you can't recall exactly when you had your last tetanus shot. 

Vaccination is the best way to prevent tetanus — a serious disease caused by a bacterial toxin that affects the nervous system. Tetanus bacterial spores can enter your body through any cut or scratch. But deep puncture wounds, such as from stepping on a nail, are most susceptible to tetanus infection.

An adult who's never been immunized against tetanus should complete the initial tetanus series of three tetanus shots. The first two shots are given at least four weeks apart, and the third shot is given six to 12 months after the second shot. After the initial tetanus series, booster shots are recommended every 10 years. Although getting tetanus shots more frequently generally isn't harmful, it may increase the risk of soreness or redness at the injection site.

If you experience a puncture wound and it's been more than five years since your last tetanus shot — or you can't remember when you had your last tetanus shot — it's best to get the booster shot.

		What is the Cookie Diet? How does it work?
	","
The original Cookie Diet was created in 1975 by Dr. Sanford Siegal to help his overweight patients lose weight. The Cookie Diet limits calories to no more than 1,000 a day, which come from six prepackaged cookies plus one meal, such as skinless chicken and steamed vegetables. The cookies are made and sold by Dr. Siegal's company and are said to contain a proprietary amino acid mixture that fights hunger.

If followed, a diet of less than 1,000 calories a day will likely lead to weight loss. But such a restricted diet can make it hard to meet all of your nutritional needs. In addition, it's difficult to stick with extreme diets such as the Cookie Diet. As a result, any lost pounds come right back once the diet stops.

The bottom line: To achieve and maintain a healthy weight, you need to make permanent and sustainable changes in your eating and exercise habits.

		What is the dawn phenomenon that some people with diabetes experience? Can anything be done about it?
	","
The dawn phenomenon, also called the dawn effect, is the term used to describe an abnormal early-morning increase in blood sugar (glucose) — usually between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m. — in people with diabetes. 

Some researchers believe the natural overnight release of hormones — including growth hormones, cortisol, glucagon and epinephrine — increases insulin resistance, causing blood sugar to rise. High morning blood sugar may also be caused by insufficient insulin the night before, incorrect medication dosages or carbohydrate snack consumption at bedtime.

If you have persistently elevated blood sugar in the morning, checking your blood sugar once during the night — around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. — for several nights in a row will help you and your doctor to determine if you have the dawn phenomenon or if there's another reason for an elevated morning blood sugar reading.

		What is the Special K diet? Can it help me lose weight?
	","
The so-called Special K diet is a diet plan created by Kellogg, the manufacturer of Special K cereal. The Special K diet, officially known as the Special K Challenge, encourages you to replace two of your regular meals, such as breakfast and lunch, with a low-fat, low-calorie Special K product, such as Special K cereal or a Special K protein meal bar or shake. The Special K diet says you can eat your third meal as you normally would. The Special K diet also encourages you to eat two snacks a day, either fruits and vegetables or additional Special K products.

As with any calorie-reduction diet, you can probably lose some weight on the Special K diet. By replacing regular meals with portion-controlled Special K products, you probably will cut your normal daily calorie intake, leading to weight loss.

On the other hand, the Special K diet may leave you feeling hungry and deprived because of the lack of variety from fruits, vegetables and other healthy food options. It also may be difficult to stick to the Special K diet long enough to reach your weight-loss goal. And once you stop the Special K diet, you may regain any weight you lost if you haven't changed unhealthy behaviors that led to your weight gain to begin with, such as overeating and lack of exercise. Remember, the key to permanent weight loss is developing healthy eating and exercise habits.

		What is thirdhand smoke, and why is it a concern?
	","
Thirdhand smoke is generally considered to be residual nicotine and other chemicals left on a variety of indoor surfaces by tobacco smoke. This residue is thought to react with common indoor pollutants to create a toxic mix. This toxic mix of thirdhand smoke contains cancer-causing substances, posing a potential health hazard to nonsmokers who are exposed to it, especially children. 

Studies show that thirdhand smoke clings to hair, skin, clothes, furniture, drapes, walls, bedding, carpets, dust, vehicles and other surfaces, even long after smoking has stopped. Infants, children and nonsmoking adults may be at risk of tobacco-related health problems when they inhale, ingest or touch substances containing thirdhand smoke. Thirdhand smoke is a relatively new concept, and researchers are still studying its possible dangers. 

Thirdhand smoke residue builds up on surfaces over time and resists normal cleaning. Thirdhand smoke can't be eliminated by airing out rooms, opening windows, using fans or air conditioners, or confining smoking to only certain areas of a home. Thirdhand smoke remains long after smoking has stopped. In contrast, secondhand smoke is the smoke and other airborne products that come from being close to burning tobacco products, such as cigarettes. 

The only way to protect nonsmokers from thirdhand smoke is to create a smoke-free environment, whether that's your private home or vehicle, or in public places, such as hotels and restaurants.

		Can thyroid disease affect my mood?
	","
Yes, thyroid disease can affect your mood — primarily causing either anxiety or depression. Generally, the more severe the thyroid disease, the more severe the mood changes.

If you have an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), you may experience unusual nervousness, restlessness, anxiety and irritability. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), you may experience mild to severe fatigue and depression. 

Still, it's unlikely that emotional symptoms such as anxiety or depression would be the only evidence of thyroid disease. Thyroid disease is usually associated with signs and symptoms such as weight gain or loss, sensitivity to hot or cold, bowel movement changes, and menstrual irregularities.

Appropriate treatment — such as medication that blocks your body's ability to produce new thyroid hormone or replaces missing thyroid hormone — usually improves both emotional and physical symptoms caused by thyroid disease.

"
		What is a thyroid peroxidase antibody test? Does it diagnose thyroid disease?
	","
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme normally found in the thyroid gland, plays an important role in the production of thyroid hormones. A TPO test detects antibodies against TPO in the blood. If you've been diagnosed with thyroid disease, your doctor may recommend a TPO antibody test — in addition to other thyroid tests — to help determine the cause. 

The presence of TPO antibodies in your blood suggests that the cause of thyroid disease is an autoimmune disorder, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease. In autoimmune disorders, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack normal tissue. Antibodies that attack the thyroid gland cause inflammation and impaired function of the thyroid. 

Your doctor may also order a TPO antibody test if you are pregnant and have an autoimmune disease, especially one that involves the thyroid, such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease. In such cases, the TPO antibody test early in pregnancy and possibly again near the end of the pregnancy can help determine whether your baby is at risk of thyroid dysfunction. 

Some people with TPO antibodies may not have thyroid disease. However, the presence of TPO antibodies may increase the risk of future thyroid disorders. If you have normal thyroid function with TPO antibodies, your doctor may recommend periodic checkups to watch for future thyroid problems.

		Can a tilted cervix reduce the chances of getting pregnant?
	","
A tilted cervix isn't likely to create problems with fertility. Likewise, a tilted cervix isn't likely to make pregnancy more difficult.

The cervix is the neck of the uterus. A tilted cervix is most likely an extension of a tipped uterus, which simply means that the uterus is tipped toward the back of the pelvis rather than the front of the pelvis.

In a few cases, the angle at which the uterus and cervix meet can make certain assisted reproductive procedures — such as intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization — more challenging.

A tilted uterus, also called a tipped uterus or retroverted uterus, is a normal anatomical variation. It shouldn't interfere with your ability to conceive.

In most women, the uterus tips forward at the cervix. About one in four women, however, have a uterus that leans backward, or tilts, at the cervix. In the past, it was thought that a tilted uterus may contribute to infertility. But experts now know that the position of the uterus doesn't affect the ability of sperm to reach an egg.

Rarely, a sharply tilted uterus may be due to a disease such as endometriosis. In this case, endometriosis — not the position of the uterus — may be a cause of infertility.

Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) can be caused by a number of medications, including some antidepressants. Not all antidepressants cause tinnitus. If your antidepressant is the cause of your tinnitus, switching to another medication may solve the problem, but don't quit taking your medication without medical guidance. 

Antidepressants are a less common cause of tinnitus than are other types of medications or underlying health conditions. Some causes of tinnitus include prolonged exposure to noise, blood vessel disorders, and neurological or mental health problems. Tinnitus can also be caused by age-related hearing loss. 

You'll need to work with your doctor to determine whether your antidepressant or something else is causing your tinnitus. Your symptoms may go away when the underlying cause is treated. If the underlying cause isn't clear — or treatment won't help — you may benefit from a device similar to a hearing aid that helps mask the ringing. A change in medication and counseling also may help you cope with tinnitus.

		What is tongue-tie and how can I tell if my baby has it?
	","
Tongue-tie, also called ankyloglossia, is a condition that restricts the tongue's range of motion. It often runs in families. 

Signs and symptoms of tongue-tie include: 

Tongue-tie can affect a baby's oral development, as well as the way he or she eats, speaks and swallows. For example, tongue-tie can cause breast-feeding problems, such as poor latch and nipple pain. Breast-feeding requires a baby to keep his or her tongue over the lower gum while sucking. If a baby is unable to move or keep his or her tongue in the right position, he or she may chew instead of suck on the nipple. Tongue-tie can also make it difficult for an older child to sweep food debris from his or her teeth, lick an ice cream cone or kiss. 

Mild cases of tongue-tie may not require treatment. If necessary, however, tongue-tie can be treated with a simple surgical procedure called a frenotomy. During a frenotomy, the doctor uses scissors to snip the frenulum — with or without local anesthesia. Discomfort and bleeding are typically minimal, and after the procedure a baby can immediately try breast-feeding again. Rare side effects include infection, ulceration, damage to the tongue or salivary glands, and recurrence of the problem. 

If your baby is having trouble breast-feeding or you notice any signs or symptoms of tongue-tie, talk to your baby's doctor. Some doctors recommend correcting the problem immediately, while others prefer to take a wait-and-see approach.

		Is it possible to take too much vitamin C?
	","
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential nutrient. Still, it's possible to have too much vitamin C. 

Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that supports normal growth and development. Vitamin C also helps your body absorb iron. Because your body doesn't produce or store vitamin C, it's important to include vitamin C in your diet. For most people, a large orange, 1 cup (about 165 grams) of sliced strawberries, chopped red pepper or broccoli provide enough vitamin C for the day. Any extra vitamin C will simply be flushed out of your body in your urine. 

For adults, the recommended dietary reference intake for vitamin C is 65 to 90 milligrams (mg) a day, and the upper limit is 2,000 mg a day. Although too much dietary vitamin C is unlikely to be harmful, megadoses of vitamin C supplements may cause:

		What are the symptoms of a tooth abscess? Will a tooth abscess go away on its own, or do I need to visit the dentist?
	","
A tooth abscess is a collection of pus that's caused by a bacterial infection in the root of a tooth or in the gum tissue surrounding the tooth. The primary symptom of a tooth abscess is a severe, persistent, throbbing toothache. Initially, the tooth may be sensitive to heat and the pressure of chewing or biting. Later, you may develop a fever, swelling in your face or cheek, and tender, swollen lymph nodes under your jaw or in your neck. If the abscess ruptures, you'll have a sudden rush of foul-smelling and foul-tasting fluid in your mouth. 

A tooth abscess won't go away without treatment. If the abscess ruptures, the pain may decrease significantly — but dental treatment is still needed. If the abscess doesn't drain, the infection may spread to other areas of your head and neck. It may even become life-threatening. 

To treat a tooth abscess, the dentist will likely drain the abscess and prescribe antibiotics to eliminate the infection. While the area is healing, the dentist may recommend rinsing your mouth with warm salt water and taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. In some cases, a root canal may be necessary. In other cases, the affected tooth must be pulled.

	","
Your worries about trampoline jumping are justified. 

Trampoline jumping poses a high risk of injury for both children and adults. Falling off a trampoline or using a trampoline incorrectly can result in strains, sprains, fractures and other injuries — including potentially serious head and neck injuries. In fact, the risk of injury is so high that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that trampolines should never be used at home or in outdoor playgrounds. The AAP supports limited use of trampolines in supervised training programs, such as gymnastics and diving classes. But even then, strict safety guidelines must be followed.

What is acute transverse myelitis?,"Acute transverse myelitis is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation of the spinal cord that damages or destroys myelin, the fatty insulating substance that covers nerve cells fibers. This results in scarring, which interrupts communications between the nerves in the spinal cord and the rest of the body.Signs and symptoms can develop over several hours or weeks and may include:Causes of transverse myelitis include:Other conditions — such as stroke, blood vessel abnormalities and a tumor of the spinal cord — may cause signs and symptoms that mimic transverse myelitis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) also may affect the spinal cord. But it usually affects other parts of the nervous system as well. When MS does involve the spinal cord, it's more likely to affect only one side of the body and cause only partial paralysis and sensory loss. Fewer than 10 percent of people with acute transverse myelitis ever develop MS.Some people with transverse myelitis recover with few, if any, long-term problems. Others may have permanent impairments that affect their ability to perform daily tasks. The level of the spinal cord at which the damage occurs determines which parts of the body are affected. Damage at one segment will affect function at that segment and all segments below it. For example, damage in the neck (cervical) region usually affects both the arms and legs; damage in the upper back (thoracic) region usually affects only the legs.A doctor may make a diagnosis by taking a medical history and performing a thorough neurological exam. Standard treatment is with high doses of corticosteroids. With such treatment, about half of the people with transverse myelitis recover within six months.Another promising therapy is plasma exchange. In one study, those with transverse myelitis who didn't respond to steroids were treated with a two-week course of plasma exchange within the first three months after onset of the condition. Forty percent of study participants showed dramatic improvement with the plasma exchange treatment.Typically, if significant recovery doesn't take place by six months after onset of transverse myelitis, it's unlikely to occur. Treatment is then directed at rehabilitation."

		Should I avoid products that contain triclosan?
	","
There currently isn't enough evidence to recommend avoiding use of products that contain triclosan — an ingredient added to certain soaps, cosmetics, clothing, cookware, furniture and toys to reduce or prevent bacterial contamination. Recent studies, however, have raised questions about whether triclosan might be hazardous to human health.

Research has shown that triclosan:

When you use a product containing triclosan, you can absorb a small amount through your skin or mouth. A 2008 study, which was designed to assess exposure to triclosan in a representative sample of U.S. children and adults, found triclosan in the urine of nearly 75 percent of those tested. 

Triclosan isn't an essential ingredient in many products. While triclosan added to toothpaste has been shown to help prevent gingivitis, there's no evidence that antibacterial soaps and body washes containing triclosan provide any extra benefits, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

If you're concerned about triclosan, look for products that don't list triclosan in their ingredients.

		Is trouble breathing a sign of asthma?
	","
Trouble breathing that lasts more than a few weeks can be a sign of asthma. For many people, the main signs and symptoms of asthma are wheezing, shortness of breath, excess mucus and chest tightness. For others, chronic cough that comes and goes periodically may be the main or only symptom of asthma. 

Keep in mind, these symptoms can be caused by a number of conditions. Other causes of trouble breathing include respiratory infections, bronchitis, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), certain medications, acid reflux and heart disease (cardiovascular disease). 

The following factors increase the likelihood that asthma may be causing your symptoms: 

See your doctor if you have a cough or other respiratory symptoms that last more than a few weeks. Even if it isn't asthma, it may be something that needs treatment. If you have severe trouble breathing or shortness of breath accompanied by chest pain or nausea, seek immediate emergency care.

		What's the importance of tummy time for a baby?
	","
Tummy time — placing a baby on his or her stomach while awake and supervised — can help your baby develop strong head, neck and shoulder muscles and promote certain motor skills. Tummy time can also prevent the back of your baby's head from becoming flat (positional plagiocephaly). 

A baby's skull is soft and made up of several movable plates. If a baby's head is left in the same position for long periods of time, the skull plates might move in a way that creates a flat spot. While it's recommended that you place your baby on his or her back to sleep to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), tummy time gives a baby the chance to experience a different position. This can help reduce the risk of flat spots. In addition, research suggests that babies who spend time on their tummies crawl on their stomachs earlier than do babies who don't practice tummy time. The more time babies spend on their tummies, the earlier they might begin to roll over, crawl on their stomachs, crawl on all fours and sit without support. 

You can begin giving your baby tummy time when he or she is a newborn. Start by laying your newborn on his or her tummy across your lap two or three times a day for short periods of time. As your baby grows stronger, place him or her on a blanket on the floor. Arrange age-appropriate toys within his or her reach. As your baby gets used to tummy time, place your baby on his or her stomach more frequently or for longer periods of time. For a 3- to 4-month-old baby, some research suggests aiming for at least 20 minutes of tummy time a day. 

Remember, however, to never leave your baby unattended during tummy time. If your baby becomes fussy or sleepy during tummy time, change his or her activity or place your baby to sleep on his or her back in the crib.

A turf toe injury usually occurs when the toe is jammed into the ground and bent too far back (hyperextended). This injury occurs most often in sports that require quick direction changes, such as football, soccer or rugby.Turf toe is named after the artificial surface (turf) found on many playing fields. Increased grip provided by the artificial surface combined with the special shoes worn to play on such surfaces can increase the risk of this injury.

Is there any connection between ulcerative colitis and arthritis?,"Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Between 5 percent and 10 percent of people with ulcerative colitis also have an inflammatory arthritis called colitic arthritis. Its cause isn't clear. But one theory is that inflammation in the digestive tract allows bacteria into the body, which trigger an immune response in the joints.Colitic arthritis tends to get worse during flares of ulcerative colitis. For this reason, treatment of the arthritis is usually directed at improving the underlying IBD. Typically, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for arthritis pain. Although NSAIDS may make IBD worse, newer studies suggest that they may be safe for people with IBD if used only for a limited time.If you have IBD and have questions or concerns about taking NSAIDs, consult your doctor."

		I'm not planning to have my newborn son circumcised. How should I care for his uncircumcised penis?
	","
In an uncircumcised penis, a fold of skin (foreskin) covers the head of the penis. If you choose not to have your son circumcised, simply wash his uncircumcised penis with soap and water during each bath. There's no need to use cotton swabs or special cleansers. Treat the foreskin gently, being careful not to pull it back forcibly. Consult the doctor if your son seems to have discomfort while urinating — especially if the foreskin fills with urine or balloons out during urination — or the foreskin becomes red, itchy or swollen.

As your son gets older, the foreskin of his uncircumcised penis will begin to separate from the tip of the penis. This allows the foreskin to be pulled back (retracted). Some boys can retract the foreskin by age 5 or even earlier, while others can't do so until puberty. As soon as the foreskin can be retracted, it's important to clean beneath it regularly. Teach your son to: 

Encourage your son to follow the same procedure through adulthood as part of his daily bathing routine.

In some cases, new breast asymmetry can be a sign of an underlying condition that requires further evaluation.Causes of uneven breasts include:If necessary, your doctor may recommend further testing to determine the cause of asymmetric, or uneven, breasts, including a mammogram, breast ultrasound or breast biopsy. There is no evidence that breast asymmetry is an individual risk factor for breast cancer. However, it is important for women to know what is ""normal"" for their breast appearance and to report any changes to their doctors.In most cases, uneven breasts are simply a cosmetic concern.

		Is there a universal blood donor type?
	","
Blood is classified by type: 

Blood is also classified by rhesus (Rh) factor, which refers to a specific antigen in the blood. If your blood has the antigen, you're Rh positive. If your blood lacks the antigen, you're Rh negative. 

At one time, type O negative blood was considered the universal blood donor type. This implied that anyone — regardless of blood type — could receive type O negative blood without risking a transfusion reaction. However, even type O negative blood may have antibodies that cause serious reactions during a transfusion. 

Ideally, blood transfusions are done with donated blood that's an exact match for type and Rh factor. Even then, small samples of the recipient's and donor's blood are mixed to check compatibility in a process known as crossmatching. In an emergency, however, type O negative red blood cells may be given to anyone — especially if the situation is life-threatening or the matching blood type is in short supply.

It is most often found in young girls before puberty and in postmenopausal women.Typically, a urethral caruncle causes no symptoms. But sometimes it can cause painful urination (dysuria), blood in the urine, and tenderness or irritation around the opening of the urethra. Although the exact cause of urethral caruncles isn't known, they may be associated with low estrogen levels.If a urethral caruncle is causing pain or irritation, treatment may include:Although urethral caruncles are usually noncancerous (benign), a final diagnosis should be made by a urologist."

"Is it true that bubble baths cause urinary infections in children? My 3-year-old daughter loves bubble baths, but her doctor says we should avoid them until she is older.","Bubble baths can be associated with urinary tract infections in children, especially in girls.The soap used in bubble bath irritates the urethra — the tube that empties urine from the bladder. This irritation may cause a burning sensation during urination. As a result, a child may hold in urine to avoid discomfort, which can lead to a urinary tract infection.Urinary tract infections occur most often in girls because girls have a shorter urethra than do boys. A shorter urethra means bacteria have an easier time getting up into the bladder to cause infection.So, even though your daughter loves bubble baths, it is best to avoid them until she is in her teens."
Why is urine yellow? Should I be concerned about changes in my urine color?,"Urine consists of excess water and waste products that have been filtered from the blood by the kidneys.

		I'm concerned about my newborn's vaccination schedule. Why do infants need so many vaccines so quickly?
	","
Newborns need multiple vaccines because infectious diseases can cause more-serious problems in infants than in older children. 

While maternal antibodies help protect newborns from many diseases, this immunity may begin to disappear as quickly as one month after birth. In addition, children don't receive maternal immunity from certain diseases, such as whooping cough. If a child isn't vaccinated and is exposed to a disease, he or she may become sick and spread the illness. 

Avoid altering your child's recommended vaccination schedule. Research shows that it's safe for infants and young children to receive multiple vaccines at the same time, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccination schedule. 

Remember, newborns and young children can be exposed to diseases from family members, care providers and other close contacts, as well as during routine outings — such as trips to the grocery store. Many vaccines can be given even if your child has a mild illness, such as a cold, earache or mild fever. Consult your child's doctor regularly to keep your child's vaccination status up to date.

		I'm wondering about vaccines during pregnancy. Which vaccines are recommended and which ones should I avoid?
	","
Generally, vaccines that contain inactivated (killed) viruses can be given during pregnancy. Vaccines that contain live viruses aren't recommended for pregnant women. 

The only vaccine routinely recommended during pregnancy is an influenza (flu) shot for women who are pregnant during flu season — typically November through March. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, so it's safe for both you and your baby. Avoid the nasal spray vaccine, which is made from a live virus. 

Your health care provider may recommend a tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster shot if you haven't had one in 10 or more years or if you have a deep or contaminated cut during your pregnancy. A routine Td booster is typically given in the second or third trimester, but can be given anytime if needed due to possible exposure.

Another form of the tetanus and diphtheria vaccine — called the Tdap — also offers protection from pertussis (whooping cough). If you haven't previously been vaccinated with Tdap, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get a Tdap vaccine during your late second trimester or third trimester of pregnancy or as soon as your baby is born. By getting Tdap during pregnancy, you'll be able to transfer pertussis antibodies to your newborn, which will help protect your baby from pertussis until he or she can be vaccinated. In addition, if you're traveling abroad or you're at increased risk of certain infections, your health care provider may recommend other vaccines during pregnancy — such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal or pneumococcal vaccines.

Certain vaccines are generally avoided during pregnancy, including: 

If you're planning a pregnancy, talk to your health care provider about any vaccines you may need beforehand. Live vaccines should be given at least a month before conception.

I heard that vaginal births may cause brain bleeding in newborns. Would a C-section be a safer option?,"Not necessarily. A study published in January 2007 reported that about 25 percent of babies delivered vaginally had a small amount of bleeding (hemorrhage) in their brains, while none delivered by Caesarean section did. Pressure on the baby's skull as it squeezes through the birth canal is the likely cause of bleeding. The study involved 88 newborns — 65 delivered vaginally and 23 delivered by C-section.Although these results are intriguing, previous studies have also found brain bleeding in children born by C-section. In either case, there's no evidence that these findings have any impact on a baby's health or well-being.The ability to see very small areas of bleeding is a product of the newest imaging technology. Although small bleeds usually heal harmlessly, larger bleeds could lead to learning problems, developmental delays or seizures later in life. However, there's no evidence at this time that a C-section protects against such problems. Also, a C-section is a surgical procedure that presents many potential, serious risks to both mother and baby."
What causes vaginal odor?,"Vaginal odor has many possible causes.The most common cause of vaginal odor is bacterial vaginosis, resulting from an overgrowth of organisms normally present in the vagina.

Other signs and symptoms of bacterial vaginosis include vaginal itching or irritation, and a grayish-whitish vaginal discharge. Treatment of bacterial vaginosis may include antibiotics.Another common cause of vaginal odor is poor hygiene. It is a good idea to wash your external genital area during regular baths or showers. Use a very small amount of mild, unscented soap and lots of water. Douching isn't necessary. All healthy vaginas contain some bacteria and other organisms. The normal acidity of the vagina keeps bacteria and yeast in check. But douching can actually upset this delicate balance.Other less common causes of vaginal odor include:If vaginal odor persists, consult your doctor."

		I had a vasectomy reversal last year. The first sperm test after the procedure was positive, but the second sperm test was negative. How could this be? Will my wife and I be able to have a baby?
	","
After a vasectomy reversal, it's possible — although somewhat rare — to have a positive sperm analysis followed by a negative sperm analysis.

There may be several possible explanations for your conflicting test results. Sometimes, lifestyle factors — including testicular temperature, smoking or the use of certain medications — temporarily decrease sperm count.

In other cases, scarring from a vasectomy reversal blocks the vas deferens — the tube that carries the sperm. When this type of scarring occurs, it usually happens soon after a vasectomy reversal — leaving a man with only negative sperm analyses. If the scarring happens later, however, a positive sperm analysis may be followed by a negative sperm analysis.

And for some men, it's simply a matter of waiting. It can take up to 15 months for sperm to appear after a successful vasectomy reversal.

To find out what's happening in your case, consult your doctor. He or she may recommend another semen analysis or perhaps a vasogram — a special X-ray used to check for blockages in the vas deferens. If a blockage is detected, it may be helpful to repeat the vasectomy reversal procedure.

If the vasectomy reversal isn't successful, you may have other options for conception. For example, it may be possible to retrieve sperm with a needle or simple surgical procedure for use with in vitro fertilization or other infertility treatments.

Vegetable juice can be an easy way to increase the amount of vegetables in your diet, but you shouldn't routinely use it to replace whole vegetables. 

Most adults should get at least three to four servings of vegetables a day, depending on their age, sex and level of physical activity. Any type of vegetable counts, whether it's raw, cooked, fresh, frozen or canned. Vegetable juice counts, too. Just make sure it's 100 percent vegetable juice and low in sodium.

		If I switch to a vegetarian diet, will I lose weight?
	","
Not necessarily. A vegetarian diet is not inherently a weight-loss diet but rather a lifestyle choice.

It is true, however, that adults and children who follow a vegetarian diet are generally leaner than nonvegetarians. This may be because a vegetarian diet typically includes less saturated fat and emphasizes more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and plant-based proteins — foods that are more filling and less calorie dense.

But a vegetarian diet isn't automatically low calorie. You can gain weight on a vegetarian diet if your portion sizes are too big or if you eat too many high-calorie foods, such as sweetened beverages, fried items, snack foods and desserts. Even some foods marketed as vegetarian can be high in calories and fat, such as soy hot dogs, soy cheese, refried beans and snack bars.

The basics of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are the same for vegetarians and nonvegetarians: Eat a healthy diet and balance calories eaten with calories burned.

Given the success of drugs to treat erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra), pharmaceutical companies have sought a comparable drug for women. Viagra has even been tried as a treatment for sexual dysfunction in women. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this use of Viagra. Indeed, there are no FDA-approved medications for treating sexual arousal problems in women. 

Female sexual response is complex. For most women, simply addressing difficulties with arousal may not get to the actual problem — which is often a lack of sexual desire. Many factors can influence a woman's sexual desire. For example: 

If you're experiencing changes or difficulties with sexual function, consult your doctor. In some cases, hormones, creams, clitoral-stimulating products or other treatments may be helpful. These products don't work for everyone, however. Your doctor may also recommend consulting a sex therapist.

		When I had a cold as a child, my mother put a little Vicks VapoRub under my nose to help me breathe more easily. Does this really work?
	","
Vicks VapoRub doesn't relieve nasal congestion. But the strong menthol odor of VapoRub tricks your brain. As a result, you feel like you're breathing through an unclogged nose. By contrast, decongestant tablets and nasal sprays sold over-the-counter appear to narrow blood vessels in the lining of your nose, leading to reduced swelling in your nasal passages. 

VapoRub has drawbacks other than its ineffectiveness as a nasal decongestant. It's unsafe for any use in children under 2 years of age. 

Swallowing a few teaspoons of camphor — one of the main ingredients in VapoRub and other topical medications, such as Campho-Phenique and Bengay — can cause fatal poisoning in toddlers. Topical camphor absorbed through mucous membranes or broken skin also can be toxic. That's why you should never put VapoRub in or around the nostrils — particularly a small child's nostrils. Finally, if VapoRub gets in your eye, it can injure your cornea.

"My mother, who lives in Greece, recently had a stroke. Her doctor recommended a drug called vinpocetine. I have not been able to find much information about this drug. Can you help?","Vinpocetine is a synthetic derivative of a compound found in the periwinkle plant (Vinca minor). Vinpocetine is available as a prescription drug in Europe and Japan. In the United States, it is sold as a dietary supplement.Some preliminary research suggests that vinpocetine may reduce some of the long-term cognitive impairment after an acute ischemic stroke — supposedly by improving blood flow to the brain. However, there have been few clinical studies that have examined the use of vinpocetine for stroke. More research is needed to determine what, if any, role vinpocetine may play in the prevention and treatment of stroke.Side effects of vinpocetine may include upset stomach, vertigo, anxiety, nausea, facial flushing, sleep problems and headache."

		What's the relationship between vitamin B-12 and depression?
	","
Vitamin B-12 and other B vitamins play a role in producing brain chemicals that affect mood and other brain functions. Low levels of B-12 and other B vitamins such as vitamin B-6 and folate may be linked to depression.

Low levels of a vitamin can result from eating a poor diet or not being able to absorb the vitamins you do consume. Older adults, vegetarians and people with digestive disorders such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease may have trouble getting enough B-12. Sometimes a vitamin B-12 deficiency occurs for unknown reasons. Your doctor may order a blood test to check levels of B-12 or other vitamins if a deficiency is suspected. 

The best way to make sure you're getting enough B-12 and other vitamins is to eat a healthy diet that includes sources of essential nutrients. Vitamin B-12 is plentiful in animal products such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs and milk. Fortified breakfast cereals also are a good source of B-12 and other B vitamins. 

Taking a daily supplement that includes vitamin B-12 may help your body get the nutrients it needs, especially if you're older than 50 or you're a vegetarian. However, B-12 and other vitamin supplements can interact with some medications and cause other concerns, especially in high doses. Talk to your doctor before you take a vitamin supplement. 

Keep in mind, the role of B vitamins in depression isn't clear. If you have a vitamin deficiency, taking a supplement may help. But no supplement can replace proven depression treatments such as antidepressants and psychological counseling.

		Are vitamin B-12 injections helpful for weight loss?
	","
There's no solid evidence that vitamin B-12 injections aid weight loss.

Vitamin B-12 is a water-soluble B complex vitamin found naturally in a variety of foods, including meat, fish and dairy products. Vitamin B-12 is also added to some foods and is available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin B-12 injections are commonly prescribed to help prevent or treat pernicious anemia and B-12 deficiency. 

Some weight-loss clinics offer vitamin B-12 injections as part of their weight-loss programs. Proponents of vitamin B-12 injections say the shots give you more energy and boost your metabolism, helping you shed unwanted pounds. But unless you have a vitamin B-12 deficiency, vitamin B-12 injections aren't likely to give you an energy boost.

Getting large amounts of vitamin B-12 through vitamin B-12 injections isn't likely to harm your health. But vitamin B-12 can interfere with the effectiveness of some medications, so if you receive vitamin B-12 injections, be sure to let your doctor know. 

If you're hoping to lose weight, resist the lure of quick and easy solutions. What counts is a healthy lifestyle. Enjoy healthier foods and include physical activity in your daily routine.

Vitamin B-12 helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells. A vitamin B-12 deficiency — most common in older adults and vegetarians — can cause various signs and symptoms, including memory loss. In such cases, vitamin B-12 supplements can help improve memory. 

In the absence of a vitamin B-12 deficiency, there's no evidence that vitamin B-12 supplements enhance memory for people who have Alzheimer's disease. Still, vitamin B-12 remains an important part of a healthy diet.

Vitamin B-12 is found naturally in foods that come from animals, including fish, meat and poultry. Many breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin B-12 as well. If you're concerned that you're not getting enough vitamin B-12 or other specific nutrients, consult your doctor — especially if you're an older adult or a vegetarian.

		Is there any proof that vitamin D supplements can prevent MS or keep symptoms of MS from worsening?
	","
Several studies have suggested that maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D may have a protective effect and lower the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Other studies suggest that for people who already have MS, vitamin D may lessen the frequency and severity of their symptoms. More research is needed to assess these findings.

When a person has MS, his or her immune system attacks the coating that protects the nerve cells. Research suggests that a connection between vitamin D and MS could be tied to the positive effects vitamin D has on the immune system.

The link between vitamin D and MS is strengthened by the association between sunlight and the risk of MS. The farther away from the equator a person lives, the higher the risk of MS. Sunlight is the body's most efficient source for vitamin D — suggesting that exposure to sunlight may offer protection from MS.

The Institute of Medicine recommends 600 international units (IUs) of vitamin D a day for adults ages 19 to 70. The recommendation increases to 800 IUs a day for adults age 71 and older.

Some doctors question whether these levels are adequate and think that getting more vitamin D would benefit many people. However, the Institute of Medicine recommends that adults avoid taking more than 4,000 IUs a day.

Very large doses of vitamin D over an extended period can result in toxicity. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite, weakness and weight loss. In addition, vitamin D toxicity can lead to elevated levels of calcium in your blood, which can result in kidney stones.

If you're concerned that you're getting too little — or too much — vitamin D, talk with your doctor about what's right for you.

		Does my baby need a vitamin D supplement?
	","
It depends on whether you breast-feed your baby or how much vitamin D-fortified formula or cow's milk your baby is drinking. 

Consider these general guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Institute of Medicine for vitamin D for babies: 

While breast milk is the best source of nutrients for babies, it likely won't provide enough vitamin D. Your baby needs vitamin D to absorb calcium and phosphorus. Too little vitamin D can cause rickets, a softening and weakening of bones. Since sun exposure — an important source of vitamin D — isn't recommended for babies younger than 6 months, supplements are the best way to prevent vitamin D deficiency in infants. 

As your baby gets older and you add solid foods to his or her diet, you can help your baby meet the daily vitamin D requirement by providing foods that contain vitamin D — such as oily fish, eggs and fortified foods. Keep in mind, however, that most babies won't consistently eat these foods during their first year. 

When giving your baby liquid vitamin D, make sure you don't exceed the recommended amount. Carefully read the instructions that come with the supplement and use only the dropper that's provided.  Chewable and gummy vitamins that contain vitamin D are available for older children. 

If you have questions about your baby's need for vitamin D supplements, consult your baby's doctor. You might also ask your baby's doctor about vitamin D recommendations for older children. Some guidelines suggest increasing vitamin D to 600 IU a day at age 1 and beyond.

		What is vitamin D toxicity, and should I worry about it since I take supplements?
	","
Vitamin D toxicity, also called hypervitaminosis D, is a rare but potentially serious condition that occurs when you have excessive amounts of vitamin D in your body.

Vitamin D toxicity is usually caused by megadoses of vitamin D supplements — not by diet or sun exposure. That's because your body regulates the amount of vitamin D produced by sun exposure, and even fortified foods don't contain large amounts of vitamin D.

The main consequence of vitamin D toxicity is a buildup of calcium in your blood (hypercalcemia), which can cause symptoms such as poor appetite, nausea and vomiting. Weakness, frequent urination and kidney problems also may occur. Treatment includes the stopping of excessive vitamin D intake. Your doctor may also prescribe intravenous fluids and medications, such as corticosteroids or bisphosphonates.

Taking 50,000 international units (IU) a day of vitamin D for several months has been shown to cause toxicity. This level is many times higher than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for most adults of 600 IU of vitamin D a day. Doses higher than the RDA are sometimes used to treat medical problems such as vitamin D deficiency, but these are given only under the care of a doctor and only for a short time.

Although vitamin D toxicity is uncommon even among people who take supplements, you may be at greater risk if you have health problems, such as liver or kidney conditions, or if you take thiazide-type diuretics. As always, talk to your doctor before taking vitamin and mineral supplements.

		What is VLDL cholesterol? Can it be harmful?
	","
Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol is a type of lipoprotein. Although you may hear about VLDL, your VLDL level usually isn't reported to you as a part of a routine cholesterol screen.

There are several types of cholesterol, each made up of lipoproteins and fats. Each type of lipoprotein contains a mixture of cholesterol, protein and a type of fat (triglyceride), but in varying amounts.

Of the lipoprotein types, VLDL contains the highest amount of triglyceride. Because it contains a high level of triglyceride, having a high VLDL level means you may have an increased risk of coronary artery disease, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Higher amounts and large VLDL particles are also associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure and stroke.

There's no simple, direct way to measure VLDL cholesterol, which is why it's normally not mentioned during a routine cholesterol screening. VLDL cholesterol is usually estimated as a percentage of your triglyceride value. A normal VLDL cholesterol level is between 5 and 30 milligrams per deciliter.

		What's the difference between vocal cord dysfunction and asthma?

Both asthma and vocal cord dysfunction can make breathing difficult. Signs and symptoms of either condition can include coughing, wheezing, throat tightness and hoarseness, but they're two separate disorders. 

Vocal cord dysfunction is the abnormal closing of the vocal cords when you breathe in or out. It's also called laryngeal dysfunction or paradoxical vocal cord motion. As with asthma, breathing in lung irritants, having an upper respiratory infection or exercising may trigger vocal cord dysfunction symptoms. However, unlike asthma, vocal cord dysfunction isn't an immune system reaction and doesn't involve the lower airways. Treatment for the two conditions also is different. 

Your doctor may suspect vocal cord dysfunction rather than asthma if: 

Because they have similar triggers and symptoms, it's common for vocal cord dysfunction to be misdiagnosed as asthma. This can lead to use of asthma medications that don't help and cause side effects. Some people have both vocal cord dysfunction and asthma, and require treatment for both conditions.

		What is walking pneumonia? How is it different from regular pneumonia?
	","
Walking pneumonia is an informal term for pneumonia that isn't severe enough to require bed rest or hospitalization. You usually aren't sick enough to stay home from work or school, so you are out walking around. Chances are you won't see a doctor for your mild symptoms. If you do see a doctor, you may not seem sick enough to need a chest X-ray, which is the only way to diagnose any kind of pneumonia.

Walking pneumonia is often caused by a type of bacterium that produces milder symptoms that appear more gradually than do those of other types of pneumonia. The illness often is brought home by young children who contract it at school. Family members of infected children typically begin having symptoms two or three weeks later. This kind of pneumonia usually doesn't need treatment with an antibiotic.

		Can I lose weight if my only exercise is walking?
	","
You might be able to lose weight that way, depending on the duration and intensity of your walking and what your diet's like. But consuming fewer calories through dietary changes seems to promote weight loss more effectively than does exercise and physical activity.

That's not to say physical activity such as walking isn't important for weight control — it is. The key to weight loss is burning more calories than you consume. Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound of fatty tissue. So if you cut 500 calories from your typical diet each day, you'd lose about 1 pound a week (500 calories x 7 days = 3,500 calories).

If you add 30 minutes of brisk walking to your daily routine, you could burn about 150 more calories a day. At that rate, you'd lose about another 1/3 of a pound (0.15 kilogram) a week. The more you walk and the quicker your pace, the more calories you'll burn. While any physical activity is good, you'll get the most benefit in terms of weight loss from activity that is moderately intense. So aim to walk at 3 to 4 miles per hour. You can gradually build up to that pace if necessary.

Once you've lost weight, exercise is even more important — it's what helps keep the weight off, even more so than calorie restriction. In fact, studies show that people who maintain their weight loss over the long term get regular physical activity. So keep walking, but make sure you also follow a healthy diet.

Tell your doctor before taking any new medications, including herbal supplements and over-the-counter remedies. Other supplements and herbal medications known to affect warfarin (Coumadin) include:Also, you should avoid taking aspirin and frequent or high doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), which can increase the effects of warfarin and cause bleeding problems.

Warfarin is a blood-thinning medication that helps treat and prevent blood clots. There is no specific warfarin (Coumadin) diet. However, certain foods and beverages can make it so warfarin doesn't effectively prevent blood clots. It's important to pay attention to what you eat while taking warfarin. 

One nutrient that can lessen warfarin's effectiveness is vitamin K. It's important to be consistent in how much vitamin K you get daily. The average daily allowance of vitamin K for adult men is 120 micrograms (mcg). For adult women, it's 90 mcg. While eating small amounts of foods that are rich in vitamin K shouldn't cause a problem, avoid eating or drinking large amounts of: 

Certain drinks can increase the effect of warfarin, leading to bleeding problems. Avoid or drink only small amounts of these drinks when taking warfarin:

		Is there any harm in taking long-term, low-dose warfarin for an extended period after an episode of deep vein thrombosis?

Warfarin (Coumadin) is a blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant) used to treat and prevent blood clots. For most people with a single episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), treatment with full-dose blood thinners is usually for only a limited time. Taking warfarin at a high dose for a longer period of time is only recommended for people who are at a high risk of developing blood clots that could cause a heart attack, stroke or pulmonary embolism. 

Long-term, low-dose treatment with warfarin may prevent future episodes of DVT, but it's not without risk. There's a risk of serious or even fatal bleeding — especially when warfarin is taken in high doses or for long periods of time. 

Ask your doctor to help you weigh the benefits and risks of long-term, low-dose warfarin therapy in your case. Also consider these self-care measures to prevent future episodes of DVT: 

If you're taking warfarin to prevent blood clots that could cause a heart attack or stroke, make sure you take it exactly as prescribed. Warfarin is a powerful medication that can have dangerous side effects.

		When should I use a cool-mist humidifier vs. a warm-mist humidifier for a child with a cold?
	","
For their safety, always use cool-mist humidifiers for children. Hot water or steam from a warm-mist humidifier or steam vaporizer can burn a child if he or she gets too close. 

Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which helps ease coughing and congestion due to a cold. Warm-mist and cool-mist humidifiers are equally effective in humidifying the air. Also, by the time the water vapor reaches your child's lower airways, it's the same temperature regardless of whether it started out warm or cool. 

Another benefit of cool-mist humidifiers is cost. Cool-mist humidifiers are less expensive than are warm-mist humidifiers because you're not paying for the heating element. You may also pay less in energy costs. If you use a humidifier, be sure to keep it clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds. Wiping down the humidifier daily with a 10 percent bleach solution — 9 parts water to 1 part bleach — is one way to safely keep it clean.

		Can natural diuretics reduce water retention and help with weight loss?
	","
Some herbs and dietary supplements, such as dandelion, ginger and juniper, may have a diuretic effect that can help with water retention. But proceed with caution before you take anything.

First, water retention can be caused by a number of medical conditions and some medications. So it's important to talk to your doctor about possible causes of water retention before trying to treat it yourself. Second, some herbs and supplements can worsen medical problems you have or interact with medications you take.

In theory, natural diuretics may help relieve water retention by making you urinate more. But there is little if any scientific evidence of their diuretic effects, so you may not find them effective. And if you're aiming for long-term weight loss, natural diuretics probably won't help.

You may be able to better manage water retention — especially if it's related to menstruation — through some simple lifestyle changes, such as cutting back on sodium. 

If you're hoping to lose water weight as part of a weight-loss goal, focus instead on eating a healthier diet and getting plenty of exercise and activity — not taking diuretics. And always let your doctor know about any dietary or herbal supplements you take.

		I'm on a low-sodium diet and paying attention to my sodium intake. How much sodium does a water softener add to tap water?
	","
Regular tap water contains very little sodium. The amount of sodium a water softener adds to tap water depends on the ""hardness"" of the water. Hard water contains large amounts of calcium and magnesium. Some water-softening systems remove calcium and magnesium ions and replace them with sodium ions. The higher the concentration of calcium and magnesium, the more sodium needed to soften the water. Even so, the added sodium doesn't add up to much.

An 8-ounce (237-milliliter) glass of softened water generally contains less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is well within the Food and Drug Administration's definition of ""very low sodium."" The majority of sodium in the average diet comes from table salt and processed foods. Thus, the best way to decrease the sodium in your diet is by cutting back on table salt and processed foods.

If you're on a diet that calls for very little sodium and you're concerned about the amount of sodium in your softened water, talk with your doctor. He or she may suggest testing the sodium concentration of your water or switching to a type of water-purification system that doesn't replace magnesium and calcium with sodium. Another option is to soften only the hot water and use unsoftened cold water for drinking and cooking.

		What causes watery eyes? I'm 80 years old, and it seems like my eyes are constantly tearing. Can I do anything about it?
	","
Watery eyes or excess tearing can have many causes. One of the most common causes of excess tearing is an age-related change that affects your eyelids. 

Normally when you blink, your eyelids move tears across your cornea to the little openings at the inner part of your eyelids (the puncta). Tears enter the puncta and travel through small collecting ducts. Then they pass into your nose through another small duct (nasolacrimal duct). As you get older, the muscles and tendons in your eyelids tend to relax. If they relax too much, the inner part of your eyelid may not lie flat against your eye surface (ectropion). This prevents tears from entering the puncta, resulting in tears pooling in the corners of your eyes. When the tears pool, they may become stagnant and irritate the eyes. Treatment of ectropion may include artificial tears, lubricating eye ointments, or surgery to tighten the tendons and muscles of your eyelid. 

Another common age-related cause of tearing is a blocked tear duct. The blockage can occur anywhere along the tear ducts from the puncta to the nasolacrimal canal. If the puncta are partially blocked, they sometimes can be dilated with a small instrument, which may provide temporary relief from tearing. If the blockage is more severe, it often can be treated with a relatively simple surgical procedure (punctoplasty) in your ophthalmologist's office. 

Other causes of watery eyes include: 

To determine the cause of watery eyes, consult an ophthalmologist. Treatment, when possible, depends on the underlying cause.

Cutting calories through dietary changes seems to promote weight loss more effectively than does exercise and physical activity. But physical activity also is important in weight control. 

The key to weight loss is burning more calories than you consume. Because 3,500 calories equals about 1 pound (0.45 kilogram) of fat, you need to burn 3,500 calories more than you take in to lose 1 pound.

For most people, it's probably too difficult to eliminate the amount of calories through exercise that you could through dieting. That's why cutting calories through dieting is generally more effective for weight loss. But doing both — cutting calories and exercising — can help give you the weight-loss edge. Exercise can help burn off even more calories than just dieting.

Exercise also is important because it can help you maintain your weight loss. Studies show that people who lose weight and keep it off over the long term get regular physical activity. If you lose weight by crash dieting or by drastically restricting yourself to 400 to 800 calories a day, you're more likely to regain weight quickly, often within six months after you stop dieting. Getting regular exercise also can help prevent excess weight gain in the first place.

Can drinking milk really help me lose weight?,"Some research suggests that drinking more milk may help some people lose weight. How? It appears that dairy products contain certain substances — including calcium — that may help regulate weight loss. But much more research is needed to determine what, if any, role milk and other dairy products may play in weight loss.A number of studies have examined the possible connection between dairy and weight loss. Some studies indicate that people who incorporate dairy products into a reduced-calorie diet lose more weight than do those who restrict calories but consume little or no dairy. However, other studies have shown no effect on weight loss from dairy intake. In addition, one study involving children showed weight gain with increased dairy intake.The debate on this controversial issue is far from over. Although there is some evidence that getting three servings a day of low-fat or fat-free dairy products can enhance weight loss, this evidence is not conclusive.

Weighted hula hoops can be a good addition to your exercise program, especially if you're able to hula hoop for at least 10 minutes at a time. In fact, any type of hula hooping, with a weighted hula hoop or a regular hula hoop, can help you meet your exercise goals. 

Weighted hula hoops are bigger and heavier than traditional hula hoops. You can use a weighted hula hoop as part of an overall fitness program, to add variety to your workouts, or simply as a fun way to get more active. Keep in mind that for most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. 

If you try a weighted hula hoop, use a hula hoop that's the right size for you. The hoop should reach somewhere between your waist and chest when it's resting vertically on the ground. The weight of the hoop is up to you. The smaller and lighter the hoop, the more energy it takes to keep the hoop going. But the bigger and heavier the hoop, the easier it is to keep going, which means you may be able to do it for a longer period of time. You can experiment with different hoops to see which kind and size you prefer. Weighted hula hoops are available at many sporting goods stores and online retailers, and even at some fitness clubs. 

Check with your doctor before using any kind of hula hoop if you have medical concerns, especially a history of back problems. And as with any physical activity, stop hula hooping and consult your doctor if you develop pain or other symptoms.

You might consider wearing a weightlifting belt if you're doing power lifting or dead lifts. A weightlifting belt can be a reminder to keep your spine in the correct position during heavy lifting. 

When you're lifting free weights, safety precautions are a must:

		Is weightlifting safe if I have high blood pressure?
	","
Maybe. It depends how high your blood pressure is. According to the American Heart Association, you should not lift weights if your blood pressure is uncontrolled — meaning it's higher than 180/110 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). If your blood pressure is between 140 to 170 mm Hg systolic or 90 to 109 mm Hg diastolic, check with your doctor before starting a weightlifting program to discuss any precautions or special considerations. 

Weightlifting can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure. This increase can be dramatic — depending on how much weight you lift. But, weightlifting can also have long-term benefits to blood pressure that outweigh the risk of a temporary spike for most people. 

Regular exercise, including moderate weightlifting, provides many health benefits, including helping to lower blood pressure in the long term. 

If you have high blood pressure, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. Your doctor can help you develop an exercise program tailored to your needs and medical conditions. 

If you have high blood pressure, here are some tips for getting started on a weightlifting program:

		Is it better to do weightlifting before or after an aerobic workout?

Whether you do weightlifting before or after an aerobic workout is up to you. Research hasn't definitively shown that one way is better than another. 

Consider the factors that fuel the debate about when to do weightlifting: 

The bottom line about weightlifting first or second? If you want to include both weightlifting and aerobic exercise in the same workout, experiment to find what works best for you. For instance, you could make either your aerobic workout or your weightlifting workout less intense. Or could consider doing your weightlifting and aerobic workouts on different days.

Someone at the gym told me that working all major muscle groups in one workout isn't a good idea. He suggested I do arms and legs two days a week and back and abs on two different days. What do you suggest?,"Weightlifting workouts need to be practical and also fit your schedule, or you likely won't stick with them. Working all your major muscle groups — arms, legs, abdominals and back — on the same day can be effective and time efficient. However, alternating muscle groups on different days throughout the week can be equally as effective — if it fits your schedule. Studies do not show a clear advantage with one program over the other."

		Is weight-loss hypnosis effective?
	","
Weight-loss hypnosis may help you shed an extra few pounds when it's part of a weight-loss plan that includes diet, exercise and counseling. But it's hard to say definitively because there isn't enough solid scientific evidence about weight-loss hypnosis alone.

Hypnosis is a state of inner absorption and concentration, like being in a trance. Hypnosis is usually done with the help of a hypnotherapist using verbal repetition and mental images. When you're under hypnosis, your attention is highly focused, and you're more responsive to suggestions, including behavior changes that can help you lose weight.

A few studies have evaluated the use of weight-loss hypnosis. Most studies showed only slight weight loss, with an average loss of about 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms). But the quality of some of these studies has been questioned, making it hard to determine the true effectiveness of weight-loss hypnosis.

Weight loss is usually best achieved with diet and exercise. If you've tried diet and exercise but are still struggling to meet your weight-loss goal, talk to your health care provider about other options or lifestyle changes that you can make. Don't rely on weight-loss hypnosis alone because it's unlikely to lead to significant weight loss.

Is weight-loss surgery safe for children?,"Weight-loss surgery can be a safe and effective option for some severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight using conventional weight-loss methods. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on a child's future growth and development are largely unknown.Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is still uncommon. But your doctor may recommend this surgery if your child's weight poses a greater health threat than the potential risks of surgery. It is important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist.Keep in mind that weight-loss surgery isn't an easy answer for weight loss. It doesn't guarantee that your child will lose all of his or her excess weight or that your child will keep the weight off long term. Also, it doesn't replace the long-term need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity."
What are the long-term effects of West Nile virus?,"Because West Nile virus infection is an emerging disease, the long-term effects aren't fully understood.Most people infected with West Nile virus have no symptoms and no long-term effects. About 20 percent develop a mild infection called West Nile fever, which causes flu-like signs and symptoms — such as fever, muscle aches, headaches and nausea — lasting up to several weeks. Less than 1 percent of infected people develop severe illness, such as encephalitis or meningitis.Some studies suggest that among people with symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization, one-third to one-half may experience health problems one year later. Another study found that even those with mild illness, such as West Nile fever, may still have health problems after one year. The most common long-term effects of West Nile virus infection include fatigue, memory loss, depression, muscle weakness, headaches and tremors.It isn't known why some people who develop West Nile virus infection make a complete recovery and others experience ongoing health problems."

		I've heard the term ""functional foods,"" but I don't know what it means. Can you explain?
	","
Functional foods are foods that have a potentially positive effect on health beyond basic nutrition. Oatmeal is a familiar example of a functional food because it naturally contains soluble fiber that can help lower cholesterol levels. Some foods are modified to have health benefits. An example is orange juice that's been fortified with calcium for bone health.

Of course, all foods are functional because they provide varying amounts of nutrients and energy to sustain growth or support vital processes. However, functional foods are generally considered to offer additional benefits that may reduce the risk of disease or promote optimal health.

Currently no legal definition exists for functional foods. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates claims that manufacturers make about functional foods' nutrient content and effects on disease, health or body function. The FDA regulates these types of foods according to whether a food is considered to be a conventional food, a food additive, a dietary supplement, a medical food or a food for special dietary use. 

If you want to try functional foods, choose wisely. And keep in mind that while functional foods may help promote wellness, they can't make up for poor eating habits. Your best bet is still to eat a balanced and varied diet.

		What is BPA, and what are the concerns about BPA?
	","
BPA stands for bisphenol A. BPA is an industrial chemical that has been used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1960s.

In particular, BPA is found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate plastics are often used in containers that store food and beverages, such as water bottles, and baby bottles and cups. They may also be used in toys and other consumer goods. Epoxy resins can be used to coat the inside of metal products, such as food cans, baby formula cans, bottle tops and water supply lines. Some dental sealants and composites also may contain BPA. And certain thermal paper products, such as cash register receipts, may contain BPA. 

Some research has shown that BPA can seep into food or beverages from containers that are made with BPA or into your body when you handle products made with BPA. BPA remains controversial, and research studies are continuing. The American Chemistry Council, an association that represents plastics manufacturers, contends that BPA poses no risk to human health. 

But the National Toxicology Program at the Department of Health and Human Services says it has ""some concern"" about the possible health effects of BPA on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. This level of concern is midway on its five-level scale, which ranges from serious to negligible. The Food and Drug Administration now shares this level of concern and is taking steps to reduce human exposure to BPA in the food supply by finding alternatives to BPA in food containers.

		I've heard that compassionate use is a way to get access to experimental treatments. How does it work?
	","
In certain situations, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows companies to provide their experimental drugs to people outside of clinical trials. This is referred to as compassionate use. But getting access to not-yet-approved drugs through a compassionate use request can be a long and challenging process.

If you're interested in trying an experimental treatment, talk to your doctor about your options. For you to receive an experimental drug through the compassionate use program, your doctor must contact the drug company and then submit an application to the FDA. For the FDA to consider your request, you must meet certain criteria:

To find out more about the rules regarding compassionate use, visit the FDA website and search for ""access to investigational drugs.""

Another way to get access to experimental treatments is through expanded access studies. In these studies, experimental drugs in the later stages of clinical trials are offered to people who don't qualify for the clinical trials. To find out if a drug is available this way, contact the drug's manufacturer. Or go to ClinicalTrials.gov and search for ""expanded access studies.""

As you consider whether to try to obtain an experimental treatment, it's important to keep a few things in mind:

		What is wheatgrass, and should I be adding it to my smoothies for better health?
	","
Wheatgrass is a nutrient-rich type of young grass in the wheat family that is sold in a variety of forms as a dietary supplement. Proponents say that wheatgrass has numerous health benefits, but there are no significant research studies to support wheatgrass health claims. 

Wheatgrass does provide a concentrated amount of nutrients, including iron, calcium, magnesium, amino acids, chlorophyll, and vitamins A, C and E. Wheatgrass fans say that its rich nutrient content boosts immunity, kills harmful bacteria in your digestive system, and rids your body of waste. Some proponents tout wheatgrass for cancer, anemia, diabetes, constipation, infections, skin conditions, colon cleansing, ulcerative colitis and joint pain, among other health concerns. Wheatgrass may also be promoted as a good way to help meet your daily target for vegetable servings. However, there are few research studies about wheatgrass, so it's difficult to assess such health claims. 

Wheatgrass is generally considered safe. It may cause nausea, headaches, hives or swelling of your throat. Wheatgrass is usually grown in soil or water and consumed raw, which means it could be contaminated with bacteria or mold. If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, don't use wheatgrass. If you have a wheat or grass allergy, celiac disease or gluten intolerance, check with your doctor before using wheatgrass. Wheatgrass can have a strong grassy taste, making it difficult to tolerate. 

Wheatgrass is available in many forms, including tablets, capsules, liquid extracts and tinctures. Wheatgrass is often used for juicing or added to smoothies or tea. You can even buy wheatgrass seeds or kits to grow your own wheatgrass at home. 

Wheatgrass isn't a miracle cure and shouldn't replace either your regular medical care or a healthy diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. But used sensibly and in moderation, wheatgrass may add interest to your diet.

		I've heard friends rave about Zumba. What does it involve, and is it a good aerobic workout?
	","
Zumba is a fitness program that combines Latin music and easy-to-follow dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval training, alternating fast and slow rhythms and resistance training. Zumba's fans say it's so popular because Zumba is a fun way to work out. 

Some research indicates that dance-type aerobic workouts like Zumba can improve cardiopulmonary endurance when done at moderate intensity and duration. The bottom line is if you enjoy Zumba, you're more likely to stick with it — and more likely to enjoy the benefits of aerobic exercise. 

As with any exercise, if a certain movement or position causes you pain, try to modify the workout to avoid the aggravating activities. And anytime you're training with resistance, remember that proper technique is key — don't get so caught up in the dance rhythm that you forget proper form.

H1N1 indicates the viral serotype; it's a kind of shorthand for characteristics that identify the virus to your immune system and allow the virus to enter your cells. 

There are many different strains of H1N1 flu. Varieties of influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B are included in each year's flu vaccine. This year, the vaccine protects against the strain of H1N1 flu that caused the 2009 pandemic.

		My 11-month-old son has had several wheezing episodes recently. Does this mean he has asthma?
	","
Not necessarily. Not all children who have wheezing episodes will develop asthma, and not all children who have asthma wheeze. 

Wheezing is an often high-pitched whistling noise that occurs during breathing. Because a child's airways are so small, any lower respiratory infection — such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — can cause wheezing in children. Sometimes a choking episode causes wheezing. In other cases, factors such as a structural abnormality in the airways or an issue with the vocal cords contribute to wheezing in children. 

Wheezing is also a classic sign of asthma — especially wheezing that won't go away or keeps coming back. In addition to wheezing, other signs and symptoms of asthma in a young child may include: 

A child's risk of asthma is higher if he or she has an allergy, such as a food allergy or hay fever, or one or both parents have asthma, allergies or eczema. 

If your child seems to be having breathing problems, talk to the doctor. Be prepared to describe your child's signs and symptoms, including when the wheezing began, what the wheezing sounds like and when it seems to happen. The details you provide will help the doctor determine what's causing your child's wheezing and whether treatment is needed.

		Is there a time that's best to brush your teeth? After certain foods?
	","
At a minimum, the American Dental Association recommends that you brush your teeth twice a day; one time should be before sleep. But if you snack and drink throughout the day, it may be helpful to brush your teeth more often. 

When you brush your teeth, you help remove plaque — a sticky film that forms on your teeth because of bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria in plaque causes the two major tooth-related diseases, cavities (dental caries) and gum disease (periodontitis). 

It's important to brush your teeth after you eat, because certain food and drinks cause bacteria in your mouth to release acids that are harmful to your tooth enamel. When you eat food or drink beverages containing sugar or starch, the bacteria in your mouth produce acids that can attack your tooth enamel for 20 minutes or more. Choosing nutritious foods that are low in carbohydrates and sugar and drinking plenty of water also can help reduce harmful acid production. 

One caveat to brushing after you eat is if you've eaten an acidic food or drink — for example, orange juice. Avoid brushing your teeth for at least 30 minutes after acidic foods and beverages. These acids weaken tooth enamel, and brushing too soon can cause damage to the enamel. If you know you're going to eat or drink something very acidic ahead of time, you may want to brush your teeth first. 

Brushing your teeth alone can't remove all of the decay-causing plaque. The American Dental Association also recommends using an antimicrobial mouth rinse plus flossing daily between your teeth to get rid of food particles and minimize plaque and bacteria.

		What would cause a person to have white stool? Should I be concerned?
	","
White stool is not normal and should be evaluated promptly by a doctor. White stool is caused by a lack of bile, which may indicate a serious underlying problem.

Bile is a digestive fluid produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Stool gets its normal brownish color from bile, which is excreted from the liver into the small intestine during the digestive process. If the liver doesn't produce bile or if bile is obstructed from leaving the liver, stool will be light colored or white.

Liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, can cause white stool. In some cases, the problem lies not in the liver but in the tube (duct) that delivers the bile to the intestines. This tube can be squeezed shut or blocked — for example, by a tumor or a gallstone — which prevents the bile from entering the intestines. Some babies are born with constricted bile ducts.

		How can bread be labeled as both white and whole wheat? Is white whole-wheat bread healthy?
	","
It may seem like it doesn't add up, but actually white whole-wheat bread is made with whole grains, just as is regular whole-wheat bread. White whole-wheat bread also is nutritionally similar to that of regular whole-wheat bread. 

The difference between white whole-wheat bread and regular whole-wheat bread is in the type of wheat used. White whole-wheat bread is made with white wheat, which lacks bran color. It also has a milder flavor and softer texture. In contrast, regular whole-wheat bread is made with red wheat, which is darker in color. It has a slightly bitter taste and a coarser texture. So even though both types of bread are made with whole grains, they have a different color, taste and texture. Other products besides bread, such as crackers and baking mixes, may also be made with white whole wheat. 

Some people prefer the taste and texture of white bread over whole-wheat bread. But if you want the nutritional benefits of whole wheat, choose white whole-wheat bread — not regular, refined white bread. White whole-wheat bread offers the same nutritional benefits as whole-wheat bread. Regular white bread, on the other hand, is made with refined grains, which go through a process that strips out certain parts of the grain — along with some of the nutrients and fiber. 

When you're selecting any kind of bread, read the label carefully. Choose breads that list ""whole"" grain as the first ingredient, such as whole wheat, white whole wheat or whole oats. If the label doesn't say ""whole"" first, it isn't a whole-grain product. For example, a product label may simply say white wheat, which is not the same as white whole-wheat bread.

		My blood pressure is always higher in the doctor's office than when I measure it at home. Why is this?
	","
You could have ""white coat hypertension."" White coat hypertension occurs when the blood pressure readings you have measured at your doctor's office are higher than they are when measured in other settings, such as your home. It's called white coat hypertension because the health care professionals who measure your blood pressure sometimes wear white coats. 

It was thought that white coat hypertension was caused by the stress that doctor's appointments can create. Once you'd left the doctor's office, if your blood pressure normalized, there wasn't a problem. 

However, some doctors think that white coat hypertension might signal that you're at risk of developing high blood pressure as a long-term condition. The same may also be true for people who have masked hypertension, meaning their blood pressure is normal at the doctor's office, but spikes periodically when measured in other settings. It's thought that even temporary increases in your blood pressure could develop into a long-term problem. 

If you have white coat hypertension, talk to your doctor about home monitoring of your condition. This can help determine if your high blood pressure only occurs in the doctor's office, or if it's a persistent condition that needs treatment.

		Does whitening toothpaste actually whiten teeth?
	","
Whitening toothpaste can whiten teeth slightly by removing surface stains, such as those caused by drinking coffee or smoking. Whitening toothpaste can also be used after a bleaching treatment to help maintain results. However, whitening toothpaste can't change the natural color of teeth or reverse discoloration caused by excessive exposure to fluoride during tooth development, penetrating surface stains or decay. 

To remove surface stains, whitening toothpaste may include: 

When used twice a day, whitening toothpaste typically takes two to four weeks to make teeth whiter. However, new research shows that whitening toothpaste containing the chemical blue covarine can make teeth appear immediately whiter. After use, blue covarine adheres to the surface of the teeth and creates an optical illusion that makes teeth appear less yellow. 

Whitening toothpaste is generally safe for daily use, but excessive use might damage tooth enamel. If you're considering using a whitening toothpaste, look for a brand that has a seal of approval from a reputable dental organization — such as the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance, which indicates that the toothpaste is effective at removing surface stains and reducing tooth decay. If you're not satisfied with the effect of whitening toothpaste, talk to your dentist or dental hygienist about more effective tooth whitening options.

		Is whole body vibration a good way to lose weight and improve fitness?
	","
Whole body vibration can offer some fitness and health benefits, but it's not clear if it's as good for you as regular exercise. 

With whole body vibration, you stand, sit or lie on a machine with a vibrating platform. As the machine vibrates, it transmits energy to your body, forcing your muscles to contract and relax dozens of times each second. You may feel as if you're exerting yourself when you do whole body vibration. You may find a whole body vibration machine at a local gym, or you can even buy one for home use. 

Advocates say that as little as 15 minutes a day of whole body vibration three times a week can aid weight loss, burn fat, improve flexibility, enhance blood flow, build strength and decrease the stress hormone cortisol. 

But comprehensive research about whole body vibration is lacking. It's not yet clear if whole body vibration provides the same range of health benefits as exercise you actively engage in, such as walking, biking or swimming. Some research does show that whole body vibration may help improve muscle strength and that it may help with weight loss when you also cut back on calories.

		I quit smoking six weeks ago, but now I'm coughing a lot, which didn't happen when I was smoking. What's going on?
	","
Although it's not common, some people find that they seem to cough more than normal soon after they stop smoking. The cough is usually temporary and may actually be a sign that your body is healing. 

Why some people seem to cough more soon after quitting smoking isn't clear. One explanation is that as the lungs heal, the microscopic hairs lining them — called cilia — begin working again. As the cilia attempt to clear out the inhaled particles, it can lead to coughing. This coughing may last as long as a couple of months, until the cilia are fully recovered. To relieve coughing in the meantime, try sipping water or sucking on cough drops. 

If coughing persists for more than eight weeks or if coughing brings up sputum or blood or disturbs your sleep, see your doctor to check for a more serious cause of your coughing.

If you're considering buying an air purifier, you have a multitude of choices. But if you want an air purifier that will eliminate cigarette smoke, you're out of luck. Tobacco smoke particles are so energized that even the most efficient ventilation systems will not reduce the exposure. Further, most air purifiers, also called air cleaners, are not designed to remove gaseous pollutants, which are a major component of cigarette smoke. 

Mechanical air filters, such as HEPA filters, and electronic air cleaners, such as ionizers, target particles, but tobacco smoke particles are designed to be small enough to be inhaled into the outer reaches of the lungs and, thus, are not trapped by such devices. Other air cleaners generate ozone, which is actually a lung irritant. At levels that don't exceed public health standards, ozone has little ability to remove air contaminants such as cigarette smoke. 

The best way to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is to not allow smoking in your home. If you smoke, this is another good reason to stop.

		Do some children outgrow asthma?
	","
In some children, asthma improves during adolescence and young adulthood. For others, symptoms go away only to return a few years later. Many children with asthma never outgrow it. 

In young children, it can be difficult to tell whether symptoms such as coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath are caused by asthma or something else. Sometimes, what seems to be asthma turns out to be another condition such as bronchitis, recurrent pneumonia or bronchiolitis. These and a number of other asthma-like conditions typically improve as children get older. 

Persistent wheezing during early childhood, having a skin allergy such as atopic dermatitis or having hay fever are clues that your child may have asthma that's likely to persist into adolescence and adulthood. Also, children with more severe asthma are less likely to outgrow it. 

It's important to diagnose and treat childhood asthma early on. Medications such as inhaled corticosteroids improve day-to-day symptoms and reduce the risk of asthma attacks. 

Work with your child's doctor to make certain you're taking the right steps to manage your child's asthma. This generally includes following a written asthma action plan to systematically track symptoms, adjust medications and help your child avoid asthma triggers.

		Is Wilson's syndrome a legitimate ailment?
	","
No, Wilson's syndrome, also referred to as Wilson's temperature syndrome, isn't an accepted diagnosis. Rather, Wilson's syndrome is a label applied to a collection of nonspecific symptoms in people whose thyroid hormone levels are normal. 

Proponents of Wilson's syndrome believe it to be a mild form of thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism) that responds to treatment with a preparation of a thyroid hormone called triiodothyronine (T3). However, the American Thyroid Association has found no scientific evidence supporting the existence of Wilson's syndrome. 

In a public health statement, the American Thyroid Association concluded: 

Hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by blood tests that detect insufficient levels of thyroid hormone. Wilson's syndrome shouldn't be confused with Wilson's disease — a rare, inherited disorder that causes too much copper to accumulate in certain organs. 

Although it's frustrating to have persistent symptoms your doctor can't readily explain, it could be worse to accept an unrecognized diagnosis from an unqualified practitioner. Unproven therapies for so-called Wilson's syndrome may leave you feeling sicker, while a treatable condition — such as fibromyalgia or depression — goes undiagnosed.

Many times, however, wisdom teeth — the third molars in the very back of your mouth — don't have room to grow properly and cause problems. Erupting wisdom teeth can grow at various angles in the jaw, sometimes even horizontally. Some wisdom teeth only partially emerge through the gums. Other times, they remain completely hidden. Wisdom teeth that aren't able to emerge normally become impacted, or trapped, within your jaw.

To prevent an impacted tooth, dentists often recommend removing the wisdom teeth before they emerge or grow too large. Many dentists believe it's better to remove the teeth when someone is younger and more likely to recover faster from surgery.

		How accurate are wrist blood pressure monitors?
	","
Wrist blood pressure monitors can be accurate if used exactly as directed. However, according to the American Heart Association, it's best to use a home blood pressure monitor that measures blood pressure in your upper arm. Devices for the upper arm are also easier to check for accuracy than are wrist monitors. 

Wrist blood pressure monitors are extremely sensitive to body position. To get an accurate reading when taking your blood pressure with a wrist monitor, your arm and wrist must be at heart level. Even then, blood pressure measurements taken at the wrist are usually higher and less accurate than those taken at your arm. That's because the wrist arteries are narrower and not as deep under your skin as those of the forearm. 

Some people can't have their blood pressure measured at the upper arm because they have a very large arm or find blood pressure measurements painful. In these cases, measuring blood pressure at the wrist is acceptable. 

It's not uncommon for blood pressure readings taken at home on any type of monitor to be different from those taken at your doctor's office. If you have a wrist blood pressure monitor, it's a good idea to take your monitor to a doctor's appointment. Your doctor can then check your blood pressure with both a standard upper arm monitor and a wrist monitor in the correct position in the same arm to check your wrist blood pressure monitor's accuracy.

		Is it safe to have an X-ray during pregnancy?
	","
Yes — having an X-ray during pregnancy is generally considered safe. It's highly unlikely that a diagnostic X-ray during pregnancy will harm a developing baby.

Most X-ray exams — including those of the arms, legs, head, teeth or chest — won't expose your reproductive organs to radiation, and a leaded apron and collar can be worn to block any scattered radiation. The exception is abdominal X-rays, which expose your abdomen — and your baby — to radiation. High doses of radiation can cause changes in a baby's rapidly growing cells. In turn, it's possible that these changes could slightly increase a baby's risk of birth defects or certain cancers, such as leukemia, later in life. Remember, however, that the typical dose of radiation associated with a diagnostic X-ray — even one of the abdomen or pelvis — doesn't pose this risk.

Before having an X-ray, tell your health care provider if you are or might be pregnant. Depending on the circumstances, it might be possible to do an imaging study that doesn't involve radiation — such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, if you have a child who needs an X-ray, don't hold your child during the exam if you are or might be pregnant. Instead, ask another person to take your place.

If you had a diagnostic X-ray before you knew you were pregnant, remember that any potential risk is exceedingly remote. If you had radiation treatment for a medical condition, the risks might be more significant. Share any concerns about radiation exposure with your health care provider. He or she might consult a medical radiation physicist to calculate your baby's radiation exposure.

I discovered I was two months pregnant after having extensive X-rays following a hip fracture. What is the potential risk to my baby?,"Although X-rays during pregnancy have the potential to cause significant problems, the risk is very well understood and diagnostic X-rays generally do not significantly increase the risk to your baby. Indeed, certain medical problems that occur during pregnancy may require X-rays. In your case, the X-rays were necessary to provide you with the best care for your hip fracture, and it's in your baby's best interest for you to be healthy.X-ray images require very small amounts of radiation. So the risk to your unborn baby is very low — even if you received multiple X-rays. If you're really worried about it, talk to your doctor. It is possible to calculate the estimated amount of radiation your baby was exposed to. It may ease your mind to know ""for sure"" that the amount of radiation your baby received was well within a safe range."

Yerba mate is a tropical plant. Yerba mate leaves and twigs can be steeped in hot water to make a tea-like beverage known simply as mate. Yerba mate, which contains caffeine, is a popular drink in some areas of South America. In the United States, yerba mate is widely available in health food stores and online. Proponents of yerba mate say that it can relieve fatigue, promote weight loss, ease depression and headaches, and help treat various other conditions. 

Some studies indicate that people who drink large amounts of yerba mate over prolonged periods may be at increased risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, esophagus and lungs. Smoking in combination with yerba mate seems to greatly increase the cancer risk. However, occasional use of yerba mate probably poses no serious risks for healthy adults. As always, check with your doctor before using any herbal product.

		Can yucca relieve arthritis pain?
	","
Yucca — a group of 30 species of shrub-like plants that grow mainly in dry regions of North America — is an ingredient in many dietary supplements that claim to promote joint health. Bark from the main stem (rhizome) of the Mohave yucca (Y. schidigera) is a common source of the yucca in these products.

Parts of various yucca plants have been used for centuries in traditional Native American medicine. But the only direct evidence that yucca relieves joint pain comes from a single study published in the 1970s and never validated in later publications.

Since then, scientists have isolated several yucca compounds that may turn out to have medicinal value. In the laboratory, some of these compounds display properties similar to those of anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat joint pain.

What these yucca-derived chemicals do in the test tube, however, is likely to be quite different from what they do in the human body. Scientific studies have validated many alternative and complementary therapies for arthritis, but yucca is not one of them.
